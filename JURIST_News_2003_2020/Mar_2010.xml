		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-01-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Monday in three cases, including the case of former <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron</a> CEO <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jeffrey+skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [JURIST news archives]. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1394.pdf">Skilling v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-to-hear-enron-ex-ceo.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">honest services fraud statute</a> [18 USC &sect; 1346 text] is unconstitutionally vague. The court also heard arguments on whether and to what extent the government must rebut the presumption of jury prejudice, which arose because of pretrial publicity and community impact of the alleged conduct. Skilling was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-jury-finds-lay-skilling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 of 19 counts of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud and is currently serving a 24-year sentence. In February 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/fifth-circuit-denies-enron-ex-ceo.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing after a three-judge panel <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-20885-CR0.wpd.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fifth-circuit-upholds-convictions-of.php">report</a>] Skilling&#39;s previous convictions and ordered him to be resentenced due to error in the lower court. Counsel for Skilling opened his arguments by stating:<blockquote>the court of appeals was correct in unanimously concluding that this was one of the very rare cases in which, because of the degree of passion and prejudice in the community, the process of voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret out and identify unduly biased jurors.</blockquote>Counsel for the US argued that the trial judge had an adequately rigorous process for selecting jurors.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1470.pdf">Berghuis v. Thompkins</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a police officer can non-coercively persuade a defendant to cooperate after the defendant has heard his <u>Miranda</u> rights but has not invoked or waived them. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the defendant&#39;s nearly three-hour silence in response to questioning constituted a <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0409p-06.pdf">desire not to waive his rights</a> [opinion, PDF] and that the state failed to satisfy its heavy burden of showing such a waiver took place. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The Michigan courts here did not unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his rights under - from his form after having read out loud from that form, he participated in a limited fashion during the interview.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that, &quot;the right to remain silent, we don&#39;t require that it be asserted. It is a presumption. And that presumption remains.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-5327.pdf">Holland v. Florida</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether &quot;gross negligence&quot; by a state-appointed defense attorney in a death penalty case provides a basis for extending the time to file a federal <em>habeas</em> challenge, in a case where the <em>habeas</em> plea was filed late despite repeated instructions from the client. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200713366.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] against extending time to file the challenge. Counsel for the petitioner Albert Holland argued that a line should be drawn between mere negligence and gross negligence. Counsel for the petition argued that negligence of any degree should not result in a tolling of the statute.

The Court of Cassation will have three months to decide whether the question should be submitted to the Constitutional Council. The application was initiated by an <a href="http://www.laconference.typepad.fr/">association of Paris bar lawyers</a> [website, in French], which has called for lawyers around France to follow its lead in order to pressure the government to reform the criminal procedure.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The widow of assassinated Rwandan president <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9115483/Habyarimana-Juvenal">Juvenal Habyarimana</a> [Britannica profile], Agathe Habyarimana, was arrested Tuesday in France on suspicions of complicity in genocide and was later released on bail. French police complied with an international arrest warrant issued by the <a href="http://www.gov.rw/">Rwandan government</a> [official website] that accused Habyarimana of helping to plan the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1288230.stm">1994 genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>] between Hutus and Tutsis in which more than 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, were killed in the span of 100 days. After her husband&#39;s assassination, which led to an escalation of violence that sparked the genocide, Agathe Habyarimana was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8545120.stm">transported from Rwanda by the French military</a> [BBC report] and has since been living outside Paris, although the <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/">French government</a> [official website, in French] has twice <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/NLP/France/Habyarimana_CRR_15-2-2007.pdf">refused</a> [2007 text, PDF, in French; <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/NLP/France/Agathe_Habyarimana_Conseil_d_Etat_16-10-2009.pdf">2009 text</a>, PDF, in French] to grant her asylum as a refugee. Her arrest comes only a few days after French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>] visited Rwanda and said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-president-admits-mistakes-were.php">cooperate</a> [JURIST report] in finding those accused of genocide. <br /><br />In January, the Rwandan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rwanda-report-finds-hutus-responsible.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] concluding that the assassination of then-president Juvenal Habyarimana was the work of Hutu extremists. An independent committee of experts, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/rwanda-commission-to-investigate-1994.php">established</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 by Rwanda&#39;s Tutsi <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/689405.stm">profile</a>], found that Hutu extremists, including members of the president&#39;s own family, were opposed to the 1993 <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/AF/profiles/Burundi/arusha.pdf">Arusha Accords</a> [text, PDF], a power-sharing agreement supported by Habyarimana, designed to end his 20-year monopoly on power. The report asserts that Hutus used the assassination as a pretext for the 1994 genocide. As of May 2009, the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>], established for the prosecution of persons responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law during the Rwandan genocide, has <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/completionstrat/s-2009-247e.pdf">rendered judgments or has trials underway</a> [completion strategy report, PDF] for 68 suspects, with six suspects awaiting trials, one retrial, and 13 fugitives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The official Iranian press supervisory body on Monday banned reformist daily newspaper <a href="http://www.etemaad.ir/Released/88-12-10/default.htm">Etemaad</a> [media website, in Persian] and moderate weekly magazine <a href="http://www.irandokht.com/news/">Iran Dokht</a> [media website]. <em>Etemad</em> is known as one of the few reformist newspapers that continued publishing after the June <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. <em>Iran Dokht</em> has ties to defeated opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html">Mehdi Karroubi</a> [NYT profile]. The publications&#39; licenses were revoked pursuant to Article 6 of the <a href="http://www.iranembassy.org.za/E/Iran%20Info/Press%20Law.htm">Press Law</a> [text], which prohibits print media from publishing news items that &quot;violate Islamic principles and codes and public rights.&quot;<br /><br />On Sunday, six journalists were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9E5NBFO0">released</a> [AP report] from a Tehran prison, while many others remain incarcerated for their reformist views. In February, a joint US-EU <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/eu-us-condemn-iran-human-rights.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] condemned Iranian action against protesters and other critics of government policy. The Iranian government has responded strongly to opposition following June&#39;s disputed elections, prompting additional criticism from rights groups and advocacy organizations. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] post-election rights abuses in Iran as some of the worst in the past 20 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Several human rights groups and anti-mine activists on Monday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/01/us-now-s-time-ban-landmines">urged</a> [press release] the US to join the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/mine/UNDocs/ban_trty.htm">Mine Ban Treaty</a> [text], marking the eleventh anniversary of the treaty&#39;s status as binding international law. Despite initial statements from the US State Department in November that the US would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-will-not-become-party-to-anti.php">maintaining its current policy</a> [JURIST report], the US government announced in its first appearance at the December <a href="http://www.cartagenasummit.gov.co/">convention</a> [summit website] of states party to the Mine Ban Treaty that the Obama administration has undertaken a <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/296376,us-review-of-landmine-policy-ongoing.html">review</a> [DPA report] of current US landmine policy. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] Arms Division Director Steve Goose emphasized the importance of the US signing onto the treaty:<br /><blockquote><br />The humanitarian and political benefits would be huge, and it would not tie the hands of the US military. Some ask how the US can join when it is at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but both those nations are members of the treaty and are already obliged to reject any use of antipersonnel mines.<br /></blockquote><br />The US is one of only two countries in the western hemisphere that is not a party to the treaty, which currently has 156 signatories worldwide. The US is also the largest financial supporter of mine clearance programs. In 2004, the Bush administration geared US policy <a href="http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=3218&programID=89&from_page=../friendlyversion/printversion.cfm">away</a> [CDI backgrounder] from signing the mine treaty and substituted usage of persistent mines with non-persistent mines. The Clinton administration did not sign the Mine Ban Treaty, but in 1998 <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd-64.htm">issued</a> [FAS backgrounder] Presidential Decision Directive 64, instructing the US military to explore alternate weapons and outlining US commitment to sign the treaty by 2006. The Mine Ban Treaty opened for signature in December 1997, and signatory countries <a href="http://www.icbl.org/index.php/icbl/Treaties/MBT/Treaty-Basics">ban</a> [ICBL backgrounder] the use of anti-personnel mines, destroy stockpiles, and take measures towards clearing mines, as well as help countries with fewer resources clear mines and give assistance to victims.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1234.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court to reconsider the case of seven Chinese Muslim <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighurs</a> detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives]. The court originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-to-hear-uighur-guantanamo.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-1234.htm">Kiyemba v. Obama</a> [docket; CCR <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kiyemba-v.-bush">backgrounder</a>] to determine whether it is within the power of the judicial branch to order the release of detainees into the US. The court ordered the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] to reconsider the case in light of the fact that each of the remaining Uighurs has received an offer of resettlement by another country. In a brief order, the court wrote:<blockquote>This change in the underlying facts may affect the legal issues presented. No court has yet ruled in this case in light of the new facts, and we decline to be the first to do so.<br /><br />Under these circumstances, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It should determine, in the first instance, what further proceedings in that court or in the District Court are necessary and appropriate for the full and prompt disposition of the case in light of the new developments.</blockquote>The order comes after the court asked the Obama administration and lawyers for the Uighurs to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-seeks-guidance-on-uighur.php">submit supplemental briefs</a> [JURIST report] explaining how the resettlement offers would affect the case.<br /><br />Also Monday, the court granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-150.htm">Michigan v. Bryant</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-150_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], in which the court will decide whether preliminary inquiries of a wounded citizen concerning the perpetrator and circumstances of the shooting are non-testimonial, rendering them admissible in court. The Michigan Supreme Court <a href="http://coa.courts.mi.gov/documents/OPINIONS/FINAL/SCT/20090610_S133725_117_Bryant1Mar09-op.Corrected.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the &quot;primary purpose of the interrogation [was] to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,&quot; concluding that the statements constituted inadmissible testimonial hearsay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">urged</a> [press release] Egypt to investigate the shootings of 60 unarmed migrants since July 2007 on the Egyptian side of the Egypt-Israeli border. The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33934&Cr=&Cr1=">majority of those killed</a> [UN News Centre report] have been Ethiopians, Eritreans, and Sudanese. Pillay stated that &quot;the sheer number of victims suggests that at least some Egyptian security officials have been operating a shoot-to-kill policy. It is unlikely that so many killings would occur otherwise. Sixty killings can hardly be an accident.&quot; In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] also <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE12/006/2010/en/db9d079a-6d97-496c-8101-b996d5c31450/mde120062010en.pdf">urged</a> [press release, PDF] Egypt to take immediate action to quell the excessive force used by its border police and to investigate the policies that encourage such force.<br /><br />In January, Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-to-build-barrier-along-egypt.php">construction of 70 miles of fence</a> [JURIST report] along Israel&#39;s border with Egypt in the Sinai in order to combat terrorism and illegal immigration. In explaining the purpose for the barrier, which has an estimated cost of more than $400 million USD, Netanyahu explained that his decision was a strategic move &quot;to ensure the Jewish and democratic character of the State of Israel.&quot; And, that &quot;Israel will remain open to war refugees but we cannot allow thousands of illegal workers to infiltrate into Israel via the southern border and flood our country.&quot; Israeli police <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/11/israel-fence-egypt">estimate</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that 100 to 200 African migrants enter the country illegally every week from Egypt, mainly in search of employment. The influx of non-Jewish migrants into Israel has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/11/world/AP-ML-Israel-Egypt-Fence.html">caused unease</a> [NYT report] among Jewish Israelis, a group which comprises three-fourths of the Israeli population and wants to maintain the country as the world&#39;s only Jewish-majority state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-6925.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-6925">Johnson v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-animal.php">report</a>] that a &quot;violent felony&quot; requires the use of physical force. The court found that the Florida battery offense does not meet the physical force requirement of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.html">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [19 USC &sect; 924 text] to be considered a violent felony for sentencing enhancement purposes. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200713497.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that such a battery does constitute a violent felony. In reversing the opinion below, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:<blockquote>Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define &quot;physical force,&quot; and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning. The adjective &quot;physical&quot; is clear in meaning but not of much help to our inquiry. ... It is the noun that poses the difficulty; &quot;force&quot; has a number of meanings. ... In more general usage it means &quot;[s]trength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,&quot; &quot;[p]ower to affect strongly in physical relations,&quot; or &quot;[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.&#8221; Black&#39;s Law Dictionary ... defines &quot;force&quot; as &quot;[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.&quot; And it defines &quot;physical force&quot; as &quot;[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.&quot; All of these definitions suggest a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, asserting that, &quot;the crime of battery, as traditionally defined, falls squarely within the plain language of ACCA.&quot;<br /><br />The defendant, Curtis Johnson, pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, and the government sought an enhanced penalty under the ACCA, which provides longer sentences for defendants who have previously been convicted of three violent felonies. Johnson disputed that his conviction for simple battery should be considered a violent felony.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Turkish government will submit a <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] reform package with proposed constitutional changes to Parliament by the end of March, <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erdogan">news archive</a>] said Sunday, following a meeting of the EU Reform Watch Group. The Watch Group, overseen by <a href="http://www.egemenbagis.com/index.cfm">Minister and Chief EU Negotiator Egemen Bag?s</a> [official profile], was created to guide Turkey&#8217;s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">accession to the EU</a> [admission criteria]. Erdogan said that the amendments, <a href="http://www.trt-world.com/trtinternational/en/newsDetail.aspx?HaberKodu=ab4c92f6-2439-4fa9-ad8f-bb28a9b25609">necessary for continuing EU negotiations</a> [TRT report], would focus on judicial reform. Other areas of potential reform include the formation of an ombudsman&#39;s office and the <a href="http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=54803">election system in Turkey</a> [World Bulletin report], including political parties. Erdogan condemned opposition parties and the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HSYK) [official website, in Turkish] for opposing a constitutional amendment, and said the government will seek a public referendum if an agreement for the constitutional amendments cannot be reached.<br /><br />Turkey has faced several obstacles as it works toward membership in the EU, including its human rights record, its stance towards political parties, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">tension</a> [JURIST report] between Turkey&#8217;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] and the military. In December, the <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court of Turkey</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/turkish-constitutional-court-bans-pro.php">voted to ban</a> [JURIST report] the Democratic Society Party (DTP) after finding the party had contacts with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pkk.htm">Kurdish Workers Party</a> (PKK) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a separatist, designated terrorist group. Erdogan has sought to end Turkey&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8201641.stm">25-year conflict</a> [BBC report] with the PKK, which has been a major impediment to Turkey&#39;s bid to join the EU. In May, the EC-Turkey Association Council <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to improve its human rights record. Last year, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/european-commission-president-urges.php">addressed the Turkish parliament </a>and applauded the government&#39;s efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/turkish-ruling-party-proposes-amendment.php">reform a controversial provision of the Turkish penal code</a> [JURIST reports] but stressed that further efforts would be necessary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Spanish <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] judge on Monday accused the Venezuelan government of aiding two rebel groups in a plot to assassinate members of the Colombian government in Spain. Judge Eloy Velasco <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201003/01/espana/20100301elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF, in Spanish] six members of the Basque separatist group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2008/11/sec-081117-cfr01.htm">ETA</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eta">news archive</a>] and seven members of the Colombian rebel group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/farc.htm">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=farc+colombia">news archive</a>] with subverting the constitutional order by collaborating to assassinate Colombian officials, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3214685.stm">President Alvaro Uribe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alvaro+uribe">news archive</a>] and his predecessor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1759419.stm">Andres Pastrana</a> [BBC profile]. The indictment accuses Venezuelan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=hugo+chavez">news archive</a>] and his administration with assisting the collaboration. Velasco found that Arturo Cubillas Fontan, former director of the Venezuelan Ministry of Agriculture, served as a key link between the groups, introducing members of ETA to FARC personal in Venezuela. A Spanish magistrate has ordered the Colombian and Venezuela governments to <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Audiencia/cree/Gobierno/Chavez/ayuda/ETA/FARC/elpepuesp/20100301elpepunac_13/Tes">surrender the accused individuals</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> report] to Spain.<br /><br />Both ETA and FARC are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU and the US. In January, a Spanish judge found that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ETA attempted to assassinate</a> [JURIST report] former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 with a rocket launcher. In April, alleged ETA leader <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Tallado/kale/borroka/elpepunac/20090419elpepinac_14/Tes">Jurdan Martitegi Lizaso</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> backgrounder, in Spanish] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/france-police-arrest-alleged-basque.php">arrested</a> in France, and a Spanish judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-court-charges-basque-leader-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] him with murder for a May 2008 car bombing that killed a Spanish policeman. In 2008, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/chavez-denounces-colombian-raid-on.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] a Colombian attack on a FARC outpost based in Ecuador as a &quot;war crime.&quot; Colombia retaliated stating that Chavez was providing financing and that <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/colombia-to-seek-icc-genocide-charges.php">Columbia would seek to have Chavez charged</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] for supporting the &quot;genocide&quot; of Colombian citizens by leftist militants.

Vlahovic, known as the &quot;monster of Grbavica,&quot; is wanted on three international arrest warrants, including one for the rape, torture, and murder of more than 100 women and children during the 1992-1995 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian war</a> [JURST news archive]. The police <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8546129.stm">captured</a> [BBC report] Vlahovic after he was accused of several burglaries near his home in Altea. Vlahovic is wanted for a series of additional violent crimes. In 1998, he was imprisoned in Montenegro for armed robbery, but escaped on June 18, 2001. Three days later, he shot a man outside a bar in Serbia and was convicted and sentenced to 15 years <font style="font-style: italic;">in abstensia</font>. He is also wanted in Spain for armed robbery. Bosnia&#39;s <a href="http://www.predsjednistvobih.ba/saop/1/Template.aspx?cid=14363,1,1">Presidency Chairman Zeljko Komsic</a> [official website] is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62136A20100302">requesting that Spain extradite</a> [Reuters report] Vlahovic to Bosnia where he is wanted on charges of genocide. Official documents will be drawn up by Bosnian officials on Wednesday and delivered to Spanish authorities within the same day. Spanish officials stated that Vlahovic would first stand before a local judge for the burglary allegations and would then be taken to the <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] in Madrid where extradition procedures are handled.<br /><br />Vlahovic&#39;s arrest comes as former Bosnian Serb leader, <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>], stands trial before the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] for alleged war crimes and genocide during the Bosnian War. Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/karadzic-claims-attacks-on-bosnian.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the ICTY for the second consecutive day on Tuesday to continue opening statements. In his statement, Karadzic referred to a &quot;holy war&quot; against Bosnian Muslims and accused Bosnians of framing him by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/7353334/Bosnian-Muslims-planted-corpses-and-exaggerated-death-tolls-Karadzic-claims.html">planting corpses and embellishing reports about fatalities</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report]. Karadzic had announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/karadzic-threatens-boycott-of-icty-war.php">planned to boycott</a> [JURIST report] his trial because he had not been given adequate time to prepare a defense.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An international court to prosecute crimes against humanity committed by communist regimes should be created by the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website], the participants of the Prague <a href="http://www.crimesofcommunism.eu/home.html">Crimes of the Communist Regime Conference</a> [official website] said in a <a href="http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/international-conference-crimes-of-the-communist-regimes">joint statement</a> [text] Friday. The participants in the conference, organized by the <a href="http://www.ustrcr.cz/en/the-institute">Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes</a> [official website], said that the new court should be established because such crimes, which are not subject to a statute of limitations under international law, fall outside the jurisdiction of current international courts. The statement also characterized the prosecution of communist crimes over the past 20 years as &quot;extremely unsatisfactory.&quot; The three-day conference, attended mostly by government officials from eastern and central Europe, focused on current communist regimes and their threat to democracy. In the statement, the participants also called for the erection of a memorial to the victims of communism in Europe and the dedication of European-wide Day of Remembrance of the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes on August 23. <br /><br />Last year, prosecutors from the five major international tribunals <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/international-prosecutors-call-for.php">called on member states</a> [JURIST report] &quot;to seriously consider the adoption of a convention on the Suppression and Punishment of Crimes against Humanity.&quot; The statement came at the end of a three-day convention and reiterated the need to fight against impunity for perpetrators of serious international crimes. Representatives from the <a href="http://www.ictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR), the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY), the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court of Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL), the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC), the<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC"> International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), and the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/action/home">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official websites] attended the colloquium, which was held in Rwanda and hosted by the ICTR. The statement, which was unanimously adopted by the participants, also called on states to ensure their legal systems can effectively prosecute international crimes, to provide full cooperation to the all international criminal tribunals, and to become a party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] of the ICC, if they have not already done so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK police on Monday arrested former Bosnian vice president Ejup Ganic for war crimes in connection with a 1992 attack against Serbian soldiers. Ganic, vice president during the outset of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">1992-1995 Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+conflict"></a>news archive], was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8544374.stm">arrested</a> [BBC report] by the Scotland Yard Extradition Unit at a London airport on the day he was to return to Bosnia. The arrest was carried out on a Serbian provisional extradition warrant for conspiracy to murder and killing wounded soldiers, in breach of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/y3gctpw.htm">Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</a> [text]. Ganic has been detained pending the completion of Serbia&#39;s extradition request, which must be completed within the next 45 days. Serbian Justice Minister Snezana Malovic said she will send an extradition request on Tuesday. Bosnian authorities have expressed outrage over the arrest and view the move as an affront to Bosnian sovereignty that endangers relations with Serbia.<br /><br />Ganic is the highest ranking official among 19 for whom Serbia has issued an arrest warrant in connection with the Dobrovoljacka Street incident at the onset of the Bosnian conflict. Serbian authorities maintain that Serbian soldiers were attacked by Bosnian forces as they were leaving Sarajevo, resulting in 42 deaths and more than 70 wounded soldiers. Bosnian authorities dismiss Serbian claims surrounding the incident on the grounds that they were defending their own territory and that Serbia is undermining procedures in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] appeared before the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Monday to defend himself against charges related to war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Karadzic began his opening statement by <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/03/01/Karadjic-Bosnia-war-crimes-trial-resumes/UPI-67501267448889/">denying</a> [UPI report] any plan to expel Muslims from Serbia, and by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/7344533/Radovan-Karadzic-war-against-Islamist-goals-of-Muslims-was-just.html">blaming</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report] Muslims and Western countries for triggering the Bosnian civil war. Karadzic is defending himself against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 counts</a> [amended indictment, PDF] including genocide and murder, after initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/karadzic-threatens-boycott-of-icty-war.php">threatening to boycott</a> [JURIST report] the trial and having standby counsel <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icty-appoints-uk-lawyer-to-represent.php">appointed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ICTY. He is scheduled to continue with his opening statements on Tuesday, with the prosecution set to call its first witness on Wednesday. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted.<br /><br />The resumption of Karadzic&#39;s trial comes after a series appeals by the defense, which have been viewed as a way for Karadzic to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8539922.stm">delay the legal process</a> [BBC report]. Last month, Karadzic appeared before the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/karadzic-claims-documents-evidence.php">seeking access to documents</a> [JURIST report] he claimed showed evidence of weapons smuggling to Bosnian Muslims. Also last month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-dismisses-karadzic-appeal-of-court.php">dismissed</a> Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/karadzic-appeals-imposition-of-court.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports] against the imposition of his court-appointed lawyer. In December, the Trial Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icty-rejects-karadzic-challenge-to.php">rejected</a> Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/karadzic-files-motion-challenging.php">motion</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the legitimacy of the court. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/jmb-icty-resumes-karadzic-war-crimes.php">began</a> Karadzic&#39;s trial in absentia in October after Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-adjourns-karadzic-war-crimes-trial.php">failed to appear</a> [JURIST reports] in court. The ICTY has also repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-appeals-chamber-upholds-rejection.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Karadzic&#39;s argument that he should be immune from trial based on an alleged agreement with former UN ambassador Richard Holbrooke.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20100302_1bvr025608.html">overturned</a> [judgment text, in German] a law requiring telecommunications providers to store information on telephone calls, e-mails, and Internet use for six months for use in possible terrorism investigations, citing privacy issues. The court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg10-011.html">found</a> [press release, in German] that Section 113 of the Telecommunications Act violates the privacy of German citizens and that the law lacks the controls to ensure the data is secure and properly utilized. The court also ruled that all stored data must be immediately deleted. The law was passed in response to a 2006 European Union (EU) <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF">directive</a> [text, PDF] requiring the retention of telephone and e-mail records for use in terrorism investigations. The court, however, stated that the German law <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,681251,00.html">exceeded the requirements</a> [Spiegel report] put forth by the EU. The law has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5joC4c05BHYFGWcY6S-8bqHZiCckAD9E6GMTO0">widely criticized in Germany</a> [AP report], with nearly 35,000 Germans filing complaints regarding the law with the court. <br /><br />The balancing of telecommunications monitoring for security purposes and privacy concerns has been a struggle post 9/11 in both Europe and the US. In January, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-foia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] are not required to confirm or deny the existence of electronic surveillance records under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. In April, the DOJ announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-limits-nsa-surveillance-after.php">limited</a> [JURIST report] the NSA&#39;s electronic surveillance, but maintained that the information being received was still important. In 2006, it was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/nsa-collected-millions-of-us-phone.php">revealed that the NSA</a> [JURIST report] was collecting phone records from major telephone companies to study the calling patterns of millions of Americans in an effort to detect terrorist activity.

In his statement, Karadzic accused Bosnians of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/7353334/Bosnian-Muslims-planted-corpses-and-exaggerated-death-tolls-Karadzic-claims.html">planting corpses and embellishing reports about fatalities</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report]. Karadzic also called the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Srebrenica+">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archives] a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/02/radovan-karadzic-siege-sarajevo-myth">farce</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] promulgated by Bosnian Muslims to incite hatred against Serbian forces. Regarding the 1994 and 1995 bombings of Markale market, Karadzic said the attacks were actually carried out by Bosnians who shelled their own people. The court adjourned after Tuesday&#39;s hearing, pending an appeal from Karadzic for more time to prepare his defense.  <br /><br />On Monday, Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010_03_01_indexarch.php#112723263723508561">began his opening statement</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/03/01/Karadjic-Bosnia-war-crimes-trial-resumes/UPI-67501267448889/">denying</a> [UPI report] any plan to expel Muslims from Serbia, and by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/7344533/Radovan-Karadzic-war-against-Islamist-goals-of-Muslims-was-just.html">blaming</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report] Muslims and Western countries for triggering the Bosnian civil war. His trial resumed on Monday after a series appeals by the defense, which have been viewed as a way for Karadzic to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8539922.stm">delay the legal process</a> [BBC report]. Last month, Karadzic appeared before the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/karadzic-claims-documents-evidence.php">seeking access to documents</a> [JURIST report] he claimed showed evidence of weapons smuggling to Bosnian Muslims. Also last month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-dismisses-karadzic-appeal-of-court.php">dismissed</a> Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/karadzic-appeals-imposition-of-court.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports] against the imposition of his court-appointed lawyer. In December, the Trial Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icty-rejects-karadzic-challenge-to.php">rejected</a> Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/karadzic-files-motion-challenging.php">motion</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the legitimacy of the court. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/jmb-icty-resumes-karadzic-war-crimes.php">began</a> Karadzic&#39;s trial in absentia in October after Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-adjourns-karadzic-war-crimes-trial.php">failed to appear</a> [JURIST reports] in court. The ICTY has also repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icty-appeals-chamber-upholds-rejection.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Karadzic&#39;s argument that he should be immune from trial based on an alleged agreement with former UN ambassador Richard Holbrooke. In June, the ICTY said that Karadzic&#39;s trial, scheduled to be the tribunal&#39;s last, is expected to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icty-sets-karadzic-trial-date-for.php">conclude in early 2012</a> [JURIST report].

A 61-page indictment charged Berk and Cihaner with plotting to discredit the AKP and other Islamic networks in Erzincan. Berk, the first currently serving officer to face trial in connection with the secular group, was specified as the head of a local Ergenekon group with Cihaner acting as a key collaborator. Cihaner&#39;s arrest has <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE62112020100302?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">increased tensions</a> [Reuters report] between the judiciary and the government, after threats from <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erdogan">news archive</a>] on Sunday to seek a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-pm-to-unveil-constitutional.php">public referendum</a> [JURIST report] if a constitutional amendment to curb the power of judges cannot be reached.<br /><br />The indictment of Berk and Cihaner follows last week&#39;s arrests and charges of more than 30 military officers in connection with a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">separate plot</a> [JURIST report] to overthrow the Islamic-rooted government. The arrests and charges began after the newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/">Taraf</a></span> [media website, in Turkish] revealed the 2003 <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/46614.htm">Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taraf</span> report, in Turkish], or &quot;Sledgehammer plot,&quot; in January. The plot included detailed plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane as part of an effort to undermine the government. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">Sledgehammer plot</a> [JURIST report] is similar to the Ergenekon conspiracy, in which the secular group is suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the AKP. The Ergenekon group is also alleged to be involved in bombings, political assassination plots, and the death of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary]. The probe into the Ergenekon conspiracy has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence opposition and further its <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1001934.html">imposition of Islamic principles</a> [DPA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">report</a>] in violation of Turkey&#39;s secular <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/tu00000_.html">constitution</a> [text]. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">Trials against the Ergenekon group</a> [JURIST report] opened two years ago with more than 200 suspects in custody.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Zimbabwean law requiring all foreign-owned companies operating in the country to transfer a majority share to local owners went into effect Monday. The <a href="http://www.sokwanele.com/files/Documents/PDFs/indig_econ_emp_act_080307.pdf">Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act</a> [text, PDF] requires all companies worth more than USD $500,000 to submit information on the racial makeup of their shareholders and a plan for the transfer of a 51 percent ownership to native black Zimbabweans within 45 days. These plans must be enacted within five years, with noncompliance resulting in <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/03/20103181150873119.html">five years imprisonment</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The law was passed by the <a href="http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/">Parliament of Zimbabwe</a> [official website] in 2007 when it was still dominated by the Zanu-PF party of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3017678.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mugabe">news archive</a>], but was published only last month. The reform scheme has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8542966.stm">faced criticism</a> [BBC report] for its timing in the wake of a major economic crisis in which the country faced hyperinflation and food shortages. Mugabe, at celebrations marking his eighty-sixth birthday Saturday, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7044750.ece">defended the law</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report], comparing it with the controversial <a href="http://www.lands.gov.zw/landreform/landreform.htm">land reform program</a> [official website] that was initiated in 2000, and saying that a country&#39;s resources should benefit its indigenous population. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morgan+Tsvangirai">news archive</a>], in a unity government with Mugabe after the contentious <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+president+election">2008 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive], opposed the enforcement of the law, claiming that it was void because it was not debated by the unity cabinet. <br /><br />In January, the Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.justice.gov.zw/departments/supreme%20court%20and%20masterregistrar/supreme.htm">High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/zimbabwe-high-court-refuses-to-register.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that it is not bound by a decision of the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/tribunal/">Southern Africa Development Community Tribunal</a> [official website] that ordered the state to halt the land reform program for its discriminatory nature. Mugabe faced <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/21/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum">harsh criticism</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] for the program, which, since 2000, has sought to redistribute white-owned land among the nation&#39;s indigenous farmers. In February 2006, the Zimbabwean land minister said that there are <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">no white farmers operating legally</a> [JURIST report] in Zimbabwe. The government has appropriated some 4,000 farms through the program, and has traditionally argued that any compensation owed white farmers should be paid by the British government, Zimbabwe&#39;s former colonizer. Many observers attributed Zimbabwe&#39;s disastrous economic circumstances, including an inflation rate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe">exceeding 231,000,000 percent</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report], to the policy, as previously productive farms become barren under new inexperienced owners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-files-habeas-corpus-petitions-behalf-four-bagram-detainees">filed <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petitions</a> [press release] on behalf of four detainees held at <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">news archive</a>] in Afghanistan. The first <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-2-26-WahidvGates-HabeasPetition.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF], filed Friday in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], challenges the detention of  Haji Abdul Wahid, a 61-year-old government employee, and his nephew Zia-ur-Rahman, a food merchant, who were imprisoned after being taken from their homes by the US military in a neighborhood sweep. The second <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-2-26-JalatzaivGates-HabeasPetition.pdf">petition</a> [test, PDF], also filed Friday, challenges the detention of Samiullah Jalatzai, who was arrested without explanation at his workplace, and his brother Sibghatullah Jalatzai, who was a US military translator prior to his detention. All four men have been held at Bagram for over a year, but the ACLU claims that none of the men has engaged in hostile behavior directed at the US, nor are they members of groups that purport to do so. The petitions ask that the men be informed of why they are detained, be permitted to speak with a lawyer, and be given a legitimate forum to challenge the legality of their detention. Staff attorney for the ACLU National Security Project Melissa Goodman said that, &quot;[l]ocking up people who were picked up far from any battlefield for years without telling them why, without giving them access to lawyers and without giving them a real chance to contest the evidence against them is unlawful and un-American.&quot;  <br /><br />In January, the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php">released a list of names</a> of 645 prisoners detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU in September. However, much of the vital information, including their citizenship, how long they had been held, in what country they were captured, and the circumstances of their capture, was redacted. Also in January, Afghan officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghanistan-authorities-commit-to.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a memorandum of understanding to delineate the process under which they will eventually take over the Bagram detention facility. The transfer of responsibility is expected within six months. Prisoners at Bagram have launched previous <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-dismisses-afghan-bagram.php"><span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> challenges</a> [JURIST report] in US courts but thus far have been less successful than those held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

Muchnick</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-first.php">report</a>] that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/411.html">federal law</a> [14 USC &sect; 411(a) text] requiring copyright holders to register their works before suing for copyright infringement does not remove federal court jurisdiction if the copyright holder failed to register. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA1LTU5NDMtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/05-5943-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl51e/1/hilite">invalidated</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court&#39;s approval of a settlement in a class action lawsuit on the grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction. In reversing that decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />Subject to certain exceptions, the Copyright Act (Act) requires copyright holders to register their works before suing for copyright infringement. In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that a copyright holder&#39;s failure to comply with &sect; 411(a)&#39;s registration requirement deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to adjudicate his copyright infringement claim. We disagree. Section 411(a)&#39;s registration requirement is a precondition to filing a claim that does not restrict a federal court&#39;s subject-matter jurisdiction.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in deciding the case.<br /><br />The case arose when a group of freelance writers filed a class action lawsuit against a group of publishers alleging copyright infringement for electronically reproducing their work without permission. The parties settled the suit with the district court&#39;s approval. When some of the plaintiffs objected to the settlement, they appealed to the Second Circuit, which ruled <em>sua sponte</em> that the federal court lacked jurisdiction over the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/9A0807.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] an emergency appeal to prevent Washington DC&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] law from taking effect. Chief Justice John Roberts, acting as circuit justice for the DC area, denied an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DC-marriage-stay-09A807.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] requesting a stay pending further review of the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20091008141223.pdf">Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF]. The request was filed by Reverend Harry Jackson and other petitioners seeking to delay enforcement of the new law. Roberts rejected the request because the court was unlikely to grant <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> for the following reasons:<blockquote>First, as &quot;a matter of judicial policy&quot; - if not &quot;judicial power&quot; - &quot;it has been the practice of the Court to defer to the decisions of the courts of the District of Columbia on matters of exclusively local concern.&quot;<br /><br />Second, the Act at issue was adopted by the Council and placed before Congress for the 30-day period of review required by the DC Charter. A joint resolution of disapproval by Congress would prevent the Act from going into effect, but Congress has chosen not to act.<br /><br />Finally, while petitioners&#39; challenge to the Act by way of a referendum apparently will become moot when the Act goes into effect, petitioners have also pursued a ballot initiative, under related procedures in the DC Charter, that would give DC voters a similar opportunity to repeal the Act if they so choose. Their separate petition for a ballot initiative is now awaiting consideration by the DC Court of Appeals. ... [T]he DC Court of Appeals will have the chance to consider the relevant legal questions on their merits, and petitioners will have the right to challenge any adverse decision through a petition for certiorari in this Court at the appropriate time.</blockquote>The law entered into force Wednesday, and the DC Superior Court began accepting marriage license applications from same-sex couples.<br /><br />In December, the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/">Council of the District of Columbia </a>[official website] gave both its <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/jmdc-council-passes-same-sex-marriage.php">preliminary</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">final approval</a> [JURIST reports] to the legislation. After the bill was signed by DC <a href="http://dc.gov/mayor/bios/fenty.shtm">Mayor Adrian Fenty</a> [official profile], the US Congress had 30 legislative days to veto it under the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/media/Legislation%20and%20Laws/Home%20Rule%20Act.pdf">Home Rule Act</a> [text, PDF], which it declined to do. DC has now become the sixth US jurisdiction to recognize marriage between same-sex couples, joining five US states: <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iranian appeals court on Wednesday <a href="http://www.kaleme.com/1388/12/11/klm-12996">upheld</a> [Kaleme report, in Persian] the death sentence for a 20-year-old student who took part in anti-government protests in December. Mohammad Amin Valian was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jGOi82Ykguy2O52q2HuEp7oYLqaw">convicted</a> [AFP report] of Moharebeh, which means waging war against God and is punishable by death under Iranian law. At trial, Vilian testified that he <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9E74HRG0">threw stones</a> [AP report] at the security officers during the protests, but that he did not hit anyone. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/done-four-killed-hundreds-arrested-in.php">protests</a> [JURIST report], which interrupted the Shia Muslim celebration of Ashura, were the largest since those that followed the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] in June.<br /><br />Last month, an Iranian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iran-court-sentences-one-to-death-eight.php">sentenced one person to death</a> [JURIST report] and eight others to prison for their involvement in the December protests. Also in February, Iranian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iran-officials-arrest-7-alleged-us.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] seven people for allegedly planning to provoke rioting on February 11, the anniversary of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7862670.stm">1979 Islamic Revolution</a> [BBC backgrounder], including several in the employ of the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> [official website]. The seven allegedly played a key role in the Ashura protests. The protests resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries, and more than 300 arrests.

The company sought both the annulment of certain articles of the directive and damages for the harm suffered as a result of the adoption of the directive. It argued that several principles of community law were violated by certain provisions of the directive, including the right of property, the freedom to pursue an economic activity, the principle of equal treatment, freedom of establishment, and the principle of legal certainty. The General Court rejected Arcelor&#39;s claim that the directive led to an unequal treatment of operators, noting that the directive applies in a general and abstract manner to all operators. Regarding the application for damages, the court held that Arcelor had failed to prove the breach of the aforementioned principles.<br /><br />Under the EU emissions regulation scheme, based on community obligations under the <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1349.php">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> [text] and the <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/1678.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/kyoto.php">news archive</a>], member states set thresholds on the quantity of emissions produced each year and allocate allowances to national producers. The Emissions Trading Directive was adopted in 2003 to encourage operators to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, by allowing them to sell their surplus allowances to other operators.

Police Chief Baltazar Gonzalez and anti-narcotics official Nelly Bonilla were arrested Tuesday in connection with a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i_oTafz-wt3qjm1sjyXt3NFhgk9QD9E7D6O80">drug-related shoot-out</a> [AP report] last year between drug traffickers and a gang of police accused of stealing large quantities of cocaine for profit. An 11-month investigation by the <a href="http://cicig.org/">International Commission Against Impunity</a> (CICIG) [official website, in Spanish] in collaboration with the prosecutor&#39;s office led to the arrests only a few days before US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hilary Clinton</a> [official website] will visit the country to discuss the country&#39;s ongoing efforts to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/04/guatemala.officials/">combat the drug trade</a> [CNN report].<br /><br />On Monday, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] released its 2010 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which highlighted Guatemala as a <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/137411.pdf">key player in the Latin American drug trade</a> [text, PDF]. One of the biggest problems in the country is the corruption among high-ranking officials. Previous police chief Porfirio Perez was <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-guatemala_03int.ART.State.Edition1.4bcdd13.html">arrested on similar drug charges</a> [AP report] last year. In January, Guatemalan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/jmb-us-requests-extradition-of-former.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former president <a href="http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/guatemala/alfonso_portillo_cabrera">Alfonso Portillo</a> [CIDOB profile, in Spanish], after the US government requested his extradition to face charges of money laundering. Portillo was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/mexico-extradites-former-guatemala.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 from Mexico to Guatemala, where he is accused of authorizing transfers of $15.8 million from the budget of the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense during his presidency from 2000 to 2004.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201003/02/espana/20100302elpepunac_2_Pes_PDF.pdf">sentenced</a> [order, PDF; in Spanish] a former Basque separatist party leader to two years in prison for promoting terrorism. The court <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/prision/Otegi/enaltecimiento/terrorismo/elpepuesp/20100302elpepunac_9/Tes">found</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in spanish] that comments made during a 2005 speech by Arnaldo Otegi, a former leader of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>], the political wing of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/eta.htm">ETA</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eta">news archive</a>], praised the terrorist acts committed by other ETA members. Otegi compared his imprisoned associates to South African leader <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html">Nelson Mandela</a> [ANC backgrounder]. The court criticized the comparison because, unlike the ETA, which is blamed for more than 800 deaths, Mandela was nonviolent. The court also disqualified Otegi from holding public office for 16 years. Otegi faces additional charges that could result in up to 30 years in prison.<br /><br />The Spanish government continues to actively pursue charges against ETA. On Monday, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-judge-accuses-venezuela.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Venezuelan government of aiding ETA in a plot to assassinate members of the Colombian government in Spain. Last month, the <a href="http://www.mir.es/">Interior Ministry of Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/basque-separatist-leader-arrested-in.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that it took into custody the suspected ETA leader, along with two other people who are believed to be senior members of the group. In January, Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that ETA had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed. Last June, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-spain-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Spain&#39;s ban of Basque political groups Batasuna and Herri Batasuna for their alleged ties to ETA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A bill was introduced Wednesday to the US <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] that would allow gay soldiers to serve openly in the US military. Senator <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joe Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official website] introduced the <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/DADT_Bill.pdf">Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF], which would repeal the military&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">&quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy</a> [10 USC &sect; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. In a <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/news-events/news/2010/3/senators-introduce-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell">statement</a> [press release] released Thursday, Senator <a href="http://burris.senate.gov/">Roland Burris</a> (D-IL) [official website] hailed the proposed legislation:<br /><blockquote><br />For too long, gay and lesbian service members have been forced to conceal their sexual orientation in order to dutifully serve their country. With this bill, we will end this discriminatory policy that grossly undermines the strength of our fighting men and women at home and abroad. This legislation will ensure that all gay and lesbian soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines can serve their country openly and proudly without the threat of prejudice or discharge.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] praised the bill, encouraging Congress to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/senate-introduces-legislation-repeal-discriminatory-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-policy">act quickly to end the policy</a> [press release]. Republican lawmakers and military leaders have <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-army-leaders-express-concern-over.php">urged Congress not to act</a> until the Pentagon completes its <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-defense-secretary-announces-panel-to.php">study</a> [JURIST reports] on the impact of repealing the policy.<br /><br />The repeal of the controversial &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy has been an important issue for US President Barack Obama since he took office, and its inclusion in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">State of Union Address</a> [JURIST report] makes it clear that it remains a priority for the administration. In January, legal advisers for the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, suggested that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pentagon-lawyers-advise-waiting-to.php">delay any internal efforts</a> [JURIST report] to repeal the policy until 2011. In October, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to end the controversial policy. After the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-declines-to-review.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST report] to review the policy in June, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-committee-to-hold-hearings-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST reports] that it would hold hearings to review it. In 2008, more than 100 retired admirals and generals of the US military called for a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/retired-top-military-officers-call-for.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the policy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-240.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-240">Mac&#39;s Shell Service, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products Co.</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-oil.php">report</a>] that a service station operator cannot recover for constructive termination under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_55_20_I.html">Petroleum Marketing Practices Act</a> (PMPA) [15 USC &sect; 2801-2806 text] when the operator continues to run the franchise with the same trademark, fuel, and premises. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/05-2771-01A.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court ruling that a franchise could recover for constructive termination even if it continues to use the same trademark, fuel, and premises. The First Circuit also reversed the district ruling on constructive non-renewal of an agreement, holding that a franchisee faced with an unlawful lease has to either sign the lease and forgo any potential actions under the act or refuse to sign and bring a challenge to it after receiving a notice of non-renewal. Partially reversing the decision below, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />We hold that a franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under the PMPA if the franchisor&#39;s allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Additionally, we conclude that a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal.<br /></blockquote><br />The court remanded the case for further proceedings.<br /><br />The PMPA regulates the relationship between oil companies and gas retailers. When Shell Oil assigned its rights under several franchise agreements to a third party, the gas station owners signed the new agreements but brought suit under the PMPA alleging constructive non-renewal and constructive termination.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Washington <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/AboutRobMcKenna.aspx">Attorney General Rob McKenna</a> [official profile] filed a motion with the state <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Tuesday announcing the adoption of a single-drug execution method. The state had previously used a three-drug cocktail to lethally inject those sentenced to be executed. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j69zEbN4JUxthH4R--Vty0eZyPQQD9E6QQ1O1">change</a> [AP report] comes as three death row inmates are challenging Washington&#39;s previous execution method that included the use of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. The single-drug system will involve only the sodium thiopental. The state Supreme Court previously <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008851008_apwabrownexecution6thldwritethru.html">issued a stay</a> [AP report] on the executions to allow more time to review the system. The Washington <a href="http://www.doc.wa.gov/default.asp">Department of Corrections</a> [official website] is currently rewriting the state&#39;s execution policy Individuals sentenced to death can still choose the three-drug method or can choose to be hanged.<br /><br />Washington is the second state to make the move to a single-drug execution protocol. Ohio conducted the first <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">single-drug execution</a> [JURIST report] in December after the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] rejected a last-minute stay application. Ohio became the first state to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">adopt</a> [JURIST report] the single-drug protocol in November. The state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> of its lethal injection practices in September after the planed execution of inmate Romell Broom <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-delays-ohio-execution.php">failed</a> [JURIST reports] when a suitable vein for the drugs&#39; administration could not be found. The new protocol consists of the intravenous injection of a single anesthetic, and provides for the intramuscular injection of two other drugs if an appropriate vein cannot be found.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/FF1C95BD-9BC7-4509-AC40-E32D1EDA41CB.htm">submitted</a> [press release] to ICC judges the names of 20 senior political and business leaders who &#8220;bear the gravest responsibility&#8221; for the deadly violence perpetrated after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election">Kenya&#8217;s 2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to Moreno-Ocampo, the 20 officials, whose names are confidential, organized and financed the post-election attacks against civilians and have yet to face prosecution for their alleged crimes in Kenya. Ocampo stressed that the officials have not been formally charged, but remain under investigation:<br /><blockquote><br />At this stage, the names are indicative only. The allegations concerning the named individuals will have to be measured against the evidence gathered independently by my office. If the Judges authorize the investigation, I will engage those who wish to clarify their role or provide further information.<br /></blockquote><br />The list includes officials from both the Party for National Unity (PNU) and the rival Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), both of whom Ocampo alleges used their political and tribal power to achieve &quot;political objectives to retain or gain power.&quot; Under the ICC&#39;s complementarity principle, the investigation may only proceed if Kenya does not conduct its own investigation into the matter, which it has thus far <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/kenya-parliament-rejects-bills.php">failed to do</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />Last month, the ICC judges requested that Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-judges-seek-additional-information.php">provide additional information</a> regarding his <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-prosecutor-seeking-formal.php">request to open a formal investigation</a> [JURIST reports] into allegations of crimes against humanity committed during the post-election violence in Kenya. The judges stated that clarification and additional information was necessary to properly exercise their review function authorized under Article 15 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-assigns-judges-to-kenya-post.php">assigned three judges</a> [JURIST report] to the Kenyan situation in November after receiving a letter from Moreno-Ocampo in which he said that he intended to request formal authorization to initiate an investigation. Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s submission to investigate the Kenyan situation is historic, in that it is the first time he has used his <span style="font-style:italic;">proprio motu</span> power, which allows him to initiate formal investigations upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] following the 2007 elections led to violence that caused the deaths of more than 1,000 people and displacement of 500,000 others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-03-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Wednesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1555.pdf">Samantar v. Yousuf</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">report</a>] on whether a foreign state&#39;s immunity under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> [materials] extends to an individual acting in an official capacity on behalf of the foreign state. The plaintiffs allege that former Somali defense minister and prime minister Mohamed Ali Samantar committed acts of torture during the regime of Somalian dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. They brought suit against Samantar, who now resides in Virginia, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/071893.P.pdf">immunity did not apply to individuals</a> [opinion, PDF], allowing the suit to proceed and reversing the district court&#39;s opinion. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The FSIA applies to suits against foreign officials for acts taken on the state&#39;s behalf, because such suits are the equivalent of a suit against the state directly. ...<br /><br />The Torture Victim Protection Act creates a cause of action but is silent about immunity, and therefore has to be interpreted consistently with background immunity principles and consistently with a preexisting statute codifying immunity...</blockquote>Counsel for the respondents argued:<blockquote>the Torture Victim Protection Act, in which Congress did create a cause of action was - that cause of action was created for - to impose a liability, personal liability, for acts that were done with &quot;actual or apparent,&quot; but included with actual, authority of the foreign state.<br /><br />Now, if Congress believes that the FSIA immunized everyone who undertook acts under color of law, or at a minimum with actual authority of the foreign state, that was a very empty statute.</blockquote>The US supported respondents as <em>amicus curiae</em>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Women&#39;s rights and opportunities have increased in nearly all Middle Eastern and North African countries over the last five years, but women in those countries still face many obstacles in achieving equality, according to a <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=383&report=86">report</a> [materials] released Wednesday. The report found that in general, women in those countries had more opportunities for employment, education, and political participation than they did five years ago. Only the politically unstable countries or territories of Iraq, Yemen, and Palestine saw a decrease in their treatment of women, according to the report, whilehe greatest progress was made in the Persian Gulf countries, which were ranked as the worst violators of women&#39;s rights five years ago. Despite the progress, the report found that women in the region still have little recourse for domestic violence and face employment, education and politics. The report cautioned, &quot;While it is possible to identify net gains or losses for women&#39;s rights in a given country, the situation is rarely as simple as that, and the course of events often reflects a great deal of contestation.&quot;<br /><br />Last month, Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/saudi-arabia-minister-to-propose-bill.php">proposed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow female lawyers to practice in some areas. In October, Kuwait&#39;s Constitutional Court ruled that female lawmakers are <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/kuwait-constitutional-court-rules-women_28.php">not required</a> [JURIST report] to wear the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hijab">hijab</a> [JURIST news archive], the traditional Islamic headscarf, and that women do <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/kuwait-constitutional-court-rules-women.php">not need permission</a> [JURIST report] to get a passport. A 2008 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] report found that female domestic and migrant workers <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/domestic-workers-facing-abusive.php">faced frequent abuse</a> [JURIST report] throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/news.asp?newsID=938">announced</a> [press release] Wednesday that the dissolved <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/">Sri Lankan Parliament</a> [official website] will reconvene to ratify a one-month extension to the current state of emergency. Rajapaksa <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-president-dissolves.php">dissolved parliament</a> [JURIST report] last month to prepare for April elections, but, under the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/CONTENTS.html">Constitution</a> [text], the president&#39;s emergency powers can be extended for only one month at a time, and the extension must be approved by parliament within ten days of the president&#39;s declaration. Rajapaksa <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/news/international/article125063.ece">announced the extension of emergency powers</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Hindu</span> report] on Tuesday, claiming that the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elan</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] still pose a threat. Parliament is <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/03/20103333313841729.html">expected to reconvene</a> [Al Jazeera report] next week.<br /><br />Last month,the Sri Lanka Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-refuses-to-release.php">rejected</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-to-review-legality.php">petition</a> [JURIST reports] to release opposition presidential candidate and former general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8356676.stm">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile], who is being held over an alleged coup plot. It is believed that Rajapaksa called early parliamentary elections to harness momentum from the presidential election in January, in which he was re-elected, to gain more seats in parliament for his political party, Freedom Alliance. Earlier last month, 37 people, most of them military officers, were arrested in connection to an alleged assassination attempt against Rajapaksa. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruled last month that Rajapaksa&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-rules-presidents.php">second term</a> [JURIST report] will begin in November. The apparent victor in January&#39;s elections, Rajapaksa defeated Fonseka by an official margin of 18 points, winning re-election to a second term in office. Fonseka has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/02/20102816287441879.html">disputed</a> [Al Jazeera report] the results, saying violence and vote-counting irregularities invalidated the outcome.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] filed a <a href="http://static.arstechnica.com/apple/Apple%20complaint%20-%20Delaware.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/03/02patents.html">press release</a>] Tuesday in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/Index.htm">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> [official website] against rival smartphone maker <a href="JAY CARMELLA:">HTC</a> [corporate website] alleging that several of HTC&#39;s products infringe 10 patents owned by Apple. The patents involve various areas of technology including hardware designs, touch-screen interfaces, and graphical user interfaces. Apple&#39;s CEO <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a> [corporate profile] explained the reason for the lawsuit:<br /><blockquote><br />We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it. We&#8217;ve decided to do something about it. We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.<br /></blockquote><br />Apple also filed a <a href="http://static.arstechnica.com/apple/Apple%20complaint%20-%20ITC.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] against HTC with the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] claiming infringement of 10 other Apple patents, seeking to bar the importation of infringing devices.<br /><br />Apple has recently been involved in numerous legal actions over alleged patent infringement. In October, Finnish telecommunications company <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Apple alleging that Apple infringed 10 of its patents since the first iPhone was released in 2007. The patents cover wireless data transmission, speech coding, and security/encryption, specifically GSM, UTMS (3G), and WLAN standards. In November 2008, EMT Technologies Inc. sued Apple, claiming that Apple <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9121481/Apple_sued_for_patent_infringement_over_iPhone">infringed its patent</a> [Computerworld report] for &quot;apparatus and method of manipulating a region on a wireless device screen for viewing, zooming and scrolling Internet content.&quot; Earlier that year, Apple <a href="http://news.cnet.com/apple/?keyword=Klausner+Technologies">settled a 2007 suit</a> [CNET report] with Klausner Technologies, which alleged Apple <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-9828078-37.html?tag=mncol;txt">infringed a patent</a> [CNET report] relating to its visual voicemail function. Also in 2007, Apple was sued for patent infringement based on the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2007/08/apple-targeted-for-iphone-patent-infringement.ars">iPhone keyboard</a> [Ars Technica report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2010-03-03/5_represii.html?mthree=9">criticized</a> [text, in Russian] Russia&#39;s justice system as an &quot;assembly line&quot; that inevitably finds the government&#39;s political enemies to be guilty. In an article published in the newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.ng.ru/">Nezavisimaya Gazeta</a></span> [media website, in Russian], Khodorkovsky warned that the current system must be reformed before change occurs &quot;in Russia&#39;s traditional way,&quot; with violence. The former chief executive of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yukos">Yukos</a> [JURIST news archive] oil company <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/sites/khodorkovskycenter.com/files/Nezavisimaya%20gazeta%20EN.pdf">described</a> [text, PDF; in English] the Russian justice system with an industrial metaphor:<br /><blockquote><br />The System - the conveyor belt of a gigantic plant, which lives inside a logic of its own that does not submit, in general, to any kind of regulation from the outside. If you have become the feedstock raw material for this conveyor belt, then at the end of it there is always a Kalashnikov machine-gun, i.e. a guilty verdict. Any other outcome to the processing of the feedstock by the System is regarded as a defective product. Therefore - again, in general - you should abandon the very thought that somebody someplace is actually going to be try to figure something out and get to the bottom of things in your case.<br /></blockquote><br />The statement echoes concerns Khodorkovsky has previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports]. <br /><br />Khodorkovsky and his former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are currently serving eight-year prison sentences after being <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 on fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from an attempt to embezzle and strip Yukos of valuable assets. In December, the Russian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-supreme-court-rules-arrest-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the 2003 arrest of Platon Lebedev was illegal. The two are currently on trial on <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">additional related charges</a> of money laundering and embezzlement, to which they have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/khodorkovsky-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports]. They could face up to 20 additional years in prison if convicted. Critics have claimed that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are politically motivated due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition against former Russian president and current <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1508119.stm#overview">East Timor</a> [BBC backgrounder] on Wednesday sentenced 24 individuals for the attempted assassination of the country&#39;s president and prime minister in 2008. The individuals, former government and military officials displaced after civil unrest resulted in a change in government in 2006, had been accused of attacking <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/378959.stm">President Jose Ramos-Horta</a> [BBC profile] at his home in the capital of Dili, resulting in injuries. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/342145.stm">Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao</a> [BBC profile], the country&#39;s first president, was also attacked, but he escaped harm. Sentences varied for each defendant, with some receiving <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/20103391335435310.html">up to 16 years in prison</a> [Al Jazeera report]. One of the most high-profile defendants, Angelita Pires, was <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/lover-acquitted-over-east-timor-murder-plot-20100303-pj4n.html">found not guilty</a> [SMH report]. Pires was romantically linked to Alfredo Reinado, a former military leader who led the attack on Horta. Reinado was killed in the attack, and Pires has long professed his innocence, going so far as to offer a defense that Reinado was lured to Horta&#39;s home in order to be assassinated. The attempted assassinations led to the declaration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/east-timor-extends-emergency-rule-after.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in East Timor, in an attempt to quell the long-standing tension between the government and those former members of the military.<br /><br />The attempted assassination of Horta and Gusmao is often cited as an important factor in the calming of tensions in the tumultuous country. Much of the conflict within East Timor stems from the country&#39;s attempts to gain independence from Indonesia in 1999, following a 25-year occupation. Last August, Horta, who won the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in attempting to resolve the Timor-Indonesian conflict, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/east-timor-president-rejects-rights.php">rejected a call for a criminal tribunal</a> [JURIST report] to investigate abuses during the Timorese bid for independence, saying that such a tribunal would harm reconciliation between the two nations. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/rights-group-urges-creation-of-east.php">request for a criminal tribunal</a> [JURIST report], to be appointed by the UN, had been made by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], which cited the lack of investigation into abuses during that period. In 2008, Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/indonesia-accepts-truth-commission.php">accepted a truth commission report</a> [JURIST report] that indicated it was responsible for rights abuses during the 1999 referendum for independence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Canadian government of Conservative Party Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged Wednesday to <a href="http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1388">strengthen copyright laws</a> [text]. Announcing government policy in the <a href="http://www.speech.gc.ca/eng/index.asp">Speech from the Throne</a> [official website] opening the third session of the Canada&#39;s fortieth Parliament, Canadian <a href="http://www.gg.ca/index.aspx">Governor General Michaelle Jean</a> [official website] said that tightening intellectual property regulations was necessary to move the Canadian economy forward:<blockquote><br />To fuel the ingenuity of Canada&#39;s best and brightest and bring innovative products to market, our Government will build on the unprecedented investments in Canada&#39;s Economic Action Plan by bolstering its Science and Technology Strategy. It will launch a digital economy strategy to drive the adoption of new technology across the economy. To encourage new ideas and protect the rights of Canadians whose research, development and artistic creativity contribute to Canada&#39;s prosperity, our Government will also strengthen laws governing intellectual property and copyright.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Last May, the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/">Office of the US Trade Representative</a> (USTR) [official website] added Canada to its <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Reports_Publications/2009/2009_Special_301_Report/asset_upload_file903_15608.pdf">Priority Watch List</a> [text, PDF] of 12 countries that are <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-trade-office-adds-canada-to-list-of.php">not adequately protecting intellectual property rights</a> [JURIST report]. The USTR claimed that Canada &quot;has not delivered on these commitments by promptly and effectively implementing key copyright reforms.&quot; In 2008, the US-based <a href="http://www.iipa.com/">International Intellectual Property Alliance</a> (IIPA), a consortium of seven trade associations representing 1,900 US companies producing and distributing copyrighted materials, said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-copyright-group-says-canada-joining.php">Canada was one of the worst violators</a> [JURIST report] of IP rights, along with Russia and China, which are also on the USTR priority list. The IIPA found that the number of violations had increased over the past year due to what it called the &quot;explosive growth of online and mobile piracy.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-02-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/supreme-court-takes-gun-rights.php">report</a>] on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Second Amendment</a> [text] right to keep and bear arms is incorporated as against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment&#39;s Privileges or Immunities or Due Process Clauses. The appeal challenges a <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/RC0STIGL.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/seventh-circuit-declines-to-apply.php">report</a>] by the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which upheld a Chicago handgun ban. In 2008, the Supreme Court struck down a similar handgun ban in the District of Columbia in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>], but circuit courts have so far refused to extend that ruling to other municipalities&#39; handgun bans. Counsel for the petitioners argued:<blockquote>Although Chicago&#39;s ordinances cannot survive the faithful application of due process doctrines, there is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing the lower court&#39;s judgment. The Constitution&#39;s plain text, as understood by the people that ratified it, mandates this result.</blockquote>The <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/home">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] also argued on behalf of petitioners. Counsel for the respondent, the city of Chicago, argued:<blockquote>The Second Amendment should not be incorporated and applied to the States because the right it protects is not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. States and local governments have been the primary locus of firearms regulation in this country for the last 220 years. Firearms unlike anything else that is the subject of a provision of the Bill of Rights are designed to injure and kill.</blockquote>The majority of justices appeared to favor petitioners&#39; view.<br /><br />Also Tuesday, the court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1529.pdf">Hui v. Castaneda</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">report</a>] on whether the Federal Tort Claims Act is the sole remedy for claims regarding the care provided by Public Health Services personnel. The Court will decide if the act precludes the cause of action recognized in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the legislation did not preclude a <u>Bivens</u> action, while the Second Circuit has <a href="http://openjurist.org/222/f3d/99/john-andrew-cuoco-v-kenneth-moritsugu-dr">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that it does. Counsel for the petitioners argued:<blockquote>Congress extended an absolute immunity to officers and employees of the Public Health Service. That provision, reflecting Congress&#39;s policy judgment that the immunity was necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death resulting from the performance of medical or related function and precludes any other civil action or proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same subject matter.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondents argued that a <u>Bivens</u> claim is not barred by statute.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm/biography">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/gordon-brown/7361967/Britain-must-protect-foreign-leaders-from-arrest.html">proposed</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] tighter restrictions on the use of politically motivated arrest warrants for foreign leaders accused of war crimes. Brown said that he would seek to make tougher &quot;the evidential basis on which arrest warrants can be allowed&quot; and to restrict the right to prosecute universal jurisdiction crimes to the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) [official website]. Writing about the UK&#39;s policy of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=universal+jurisdiction">news archive</a>], Brown explained that he is seeking to introduce these changes because &quot;there is now significant danger of such a provision being exploited by politically-motivated organisations or individuals.&quot; Brown wrote:<blockquote>But by bringing the risk of arrest into closer alignment with the risk of prosecution, our system of universal jurisdiction can be stronger. For it would be clear that we only bring cases based on evidence of sufficient strength to convince the Director of Public Prosecutions that there is a credible case.<br /><br />With this approach, I am confident that an amendment on better enforcement of existing legislation will serve to enhance Britain&#39;s status in the eyes of international law, world opinion and history.</blockquote>Brown intends to propose these changes and have them in place as soon as possible. <br /><br />In January, Israeli officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-officers-abandon-uk-visit.php">abandoned a trip to the UK</a> [JURIST report] over fears that they would be arrested on war crimes charges for their involvement in last year&#39;s Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. In December, former Israeli foreign minister <a href="http://tzipilivni.co.il/">Tzipi Livni</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a trip</a> [JURIST report] to the UK, just two months after <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/11/Lieutenant-General%20Moshe%20Ya-alon">Vice Prime Minister Moshe Ya&#39;alon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-cabinet-minister-cancels-uk-trip.php">called off a trip</a> [JURIST report] over fears of being arrested for war crimes. Other countries have also recently moved to limit the reach of their universal jurisdiction statutes. France, which in January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-ministers-propose-new-judicial.php">proposed a new judicial unit</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes and genocide, requires that the crime have a connection to France, which runs counter to the principle of universal jurisdiction. Last year, in a move that <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-groups-urge-spain-to-continue.php">drew criticism</a>, Spain <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limited universal jurisdiction</a> [JURIST reports] to crimes committed by or against Spaniards, or where the perpetrators are in Spain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson for the US <a href="www.state.gov">State Department</a> [official website] said Friday that the Obama administration <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2010/03/137870.htm">opposes</a> [daily press briefing] a vote before the full House of Representatives on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [H Res 252 text] branding the World War I-era killings of Armenians by Turkish forces as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=armenian+genocide">genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. Assistant Secretary of State Philip Crowley said, &quot;that any further congressional action will impede the normalization process between Turkey and Armenia.&quot; Even though Turkey has recalled its ambassador to the US, Crowley said that the State Department believes:<br /><blockquote><br />that the best way for Turkey and Armenia to address their shared past is through their ongoing effort to normalize relations. We have been in contact with Turkish and Armenian officials at the highest levels to urge timely ratification of the protocols, and we look forward to continuing dialogue with them.<br /></blockquote><br />Crowley noted that the State Department doesn&#39;t &quot;think any further congressional action is appropriate.&quot;<br /><br />The US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/">Committee on Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] Thursday by a vote of 23-22, even after Obama administration officials had urged the committee <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/world/europe/05armenia.html">not to hold the vote</a> [NYT report], fearing that such a resolution could damage relations with Turkey. Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pMain.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="http://www.bbm.gov.tr/Forms/p_NewsDetail.aspx">condemned the resolution</a> [press release, in Turkish], and the Turkish government pulled its ambassador to the US. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-house-panel-approves-resolution-on.php">similar resolution was passed</a> by the committee in 2007, but it <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/turkish-pm-welcomes-delayed-vote-on-us.php">never reached the House floor</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] released a full-page <a href="http://www.aclu.org/aclu-ad-what-will-it-be-mr-president">advertisement</a> [image] in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> on Sunday, imploring President Barack Obama to fulfill his pledge to try suspected <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] terrorists in federal courts. The ad, which features a series of pictures that morph Obama&#39;s picture to one of former president George W. Bush, extols the virtues of the US criminal justice system and outlines the fact that the vast majority of suspected terrorists have been tried in non-military courts. The ACLU also <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010.03.06_ACLU_ADR_Letter_to_President_Obama.pdf">sent a letter</a> [text, PDF] to Obama on Sunday, conveying a similar message to that in the advertisement. In the letter, ACLU executive director Anthony Romero discussed many of the problems associated with military tribunals:<br /><blockquote><br />Most of the attention on the legal problems with the military commissions has focused on the looser evidentiary statute, particularly the admissibility of coerced evidence and hearsay evidence that would be barred from every federal or state criminal trial or court martial in the United States, but there are also fundamental constitutional questions that could jeopardize the use of military commissions and could result in the reversal of any conviction. I believe these challenges are significant enough that the risk of such challenges succeeding should alone be sufficient reason to reject military commissions, particularly for defendants alleged to have had a role in the September 11 attacks.<br /></blockquote><br />With the venue for these trials in limbo, it is unclear when the trials of many linked to the 9/11 attacks, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] will begin.<br /><br />It was reported on Friday that White House advisers are <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. Attorney General Eric Holder announced in November that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism. Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to charge suspected terrorist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [JURIST news archive], the so-called Christmas Day bomber, in US federal court. Holder, who has <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/29/rep-king-calls-military-tribunal-abdulmutallab/">resisted calls from high-level Republicans</a> [AP Report] to try Abdulmutallab in front of a military tribunal, said that the civilian criminal justice system was capable of handling his trial.

The motion comes just days after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1234.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-sends-uighur-case-back-to.php">report</a>] the appeals court to reconsider the case of <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-1234.htm">Kiyemba v. Obama</a> [docket; CCR <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kiyemba-v.-bush">backgrounder</a>] in light of the fact that each of the remaining Uighurs has received an offer of resettlement by another country. The detainees&#39; counsel argues that additional fact-finding at the district court level is necessary in light of the resettlement offers. The circuit court has yet to take any action on the case.<br /><br />Of the 22 Uighurs originally detained at Guantanamo Bay, 17 have accepted offers of relocation to other countries. Six Uighurs were transferred to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, four to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a>, five to <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">Albania</a>, and two, still in US custody, have accepted offers of resettlement to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/switzerland-to-accept-2-uighur.php">Switzerland</a> [JURIST reports]. Palau <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jBVEdGJ1HqCSQD9NQt9BLVG7eOfw">announced</a> [AFP report] it would accept the remaining five Uighurs, but the detainees subsequently rejected the offers. China considers the Uighurs to be terrorists, raising <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-again-calls-for-return-of-uighur.php">concerns</a> [JURIST report] in the Obama administration that the prisoners will be tortured if repatriated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/">Committee on Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] voted 23-22 Tuesday to adopt a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [H Res 252 text] that recognizes the Ottoman Empire&#39;s treatment of Armenians between 1915 and 1923 as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=armenian+genocide">genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. In his <a href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/press_display.asp?id=714">opening remarks</a> [text], committee chairman <a href="http://www.house.gov/berman/">Howard Berman</a> (D-CA) [official website], noted that every country must face uncomfortable issues its past, and continued, &quot;[i]t is now time for Turkey to accept the reality of the Armenian Genocide.&quot; The non-binding resolution:<br /><blockquote><br />calls upon the President in the President&#39;s annual message commemorating the Armenian Genocide issued on or about April 24, to accurately characterize the systematic and deliberate annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide and to recall the proud history of United States intervention in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.<br /></blockquote><br />Obama administration officials had urged the committee <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/05/world/europe/05armenia.html">not to hold the vote</a> [NYT report], fearing that such a resolution could damage relations with Turkey. Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pMain.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="http://www.bbm.gov.tr/Forms/p_NewsDetail.aspx">condemned the resolution</a> [press release, in Turkish], denying the charges and warning the resolution could harm Turkey&#39;s relationship with the US and Armenia. Turkey also recalled its ambassador to the US Thursday. It is not known whether the full House of Representatives will vote on the resolution. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-house-panel-approves-resolution-on.php">similar resolution was passed</a> by the committee in 2007, but it <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/turkish-pm-welcomes-delayed-vote-on-us.php">never reached the House floor</a> [JURIST reports].<br /><br />In October, Armenia and Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/turkey-and-armenia-sign-accord.php">signed an accord</a> [JURIST report] normalizing relations and opening the border between the two countries. Despite the apparent appeal of the agreement, there is opposition by factions in both countries. Many Armenian nationalists want Turkey to acknowledge the killings of 1.5 million Armenian citizens during World War I, which many refer to as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1132336.stm">&quot;Armenian Genocide&quot;</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Turkey has long <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/10/200910114325993478.html">disputed</a> [Al Jazeera report] the numbers, and has said the killings were a result of a civil war that took place after the collapse of the Ottoman empire. Turkey has expressed concern over its ally Azerbaijan, which has been <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4749647,00.html">fighting</a> [DW report] with Armenia over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Turkey closed its border to Armenia in 1993 after Armenian separatists began fighting with Azerbaijani military to show its support for the preservation of Azerbaijan&#39;s territorial integrity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French prosecutors on Friday filed preliminary terrorism charges against the suspected leader of the Basque separatist group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/eta.htm">ETA</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">news archive</a>], along with two other people who are believed to be senior members of the group. A judicial source said that the charges against the alleged ETA members stem from <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/preliminary-charges-filed-in-france-against-suspected-eta-leader-86586817.html">preparations to commit a terrorist act</a> [AP report], including theft, forgery, and illegal arms charges. The three men, Ibon Gogeascoechea Arronategui, Beinat Aguinalde Ugartemendia, and Gergorio Jimenez Moralesare, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/basque-separatist-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested on Sunday</a> [JURIST report] in the French village Cahan in a joint Spain-France operation. Gogeascoechea is thought to be ETA&#39;s military leader. He has been sought since 1997 for his role in planting explosives around the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, which was believed to be an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8541422.stm">assassination attempt</a> [BBC report] on King Juan Carlos. The two other men - Beinat Aguinalde Ugartemendia, and Gergorio Jimenez Morales - are <a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/europe/20100228-military-chief-eta-arrested-france">wanted for separate assassinations</a> [RFI report] that took place in 2008.<br /><br />Spain has made great strides recently in its attempts to limit ETA influence. Earlier this week, the Spanish <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-court-sentences-former-basque.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Basque separatist party leader Arnaldo Otegi to two years in prison for promoting terrorism in a speech he gave. In January Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that ETA had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed. Grande-Marlaska <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ETA/intento/derribar/veces/avion/Aznar/misil/funciono/elpepiesp/20100113elpepinac_1/Tes">detailed the three assassination attempts</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] as part of a description of the alleged crimes of ETA leader Pedro Maria Olano Zabala, who was arrested in the Basque region earlier that month. In June, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-spain-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Spain&#39;s ban of Basque political groups <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>] and Herri Batasuna for their alleged ties to ETA. In April, alleged ETA leader <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Tallado/kale/borroka/elpepunac/20090419elpepinac_14/Tes">Jurdan Martitegi Lizaso</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</font> backgrounder, in Spanish] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/france-police-arrest-alleged-basque.php">arrested</a> in France, and a Spanish judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-court-charges-basque-leader-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] him with murder for a May 2008 car bombing that killed a Spanish policeman.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/pdf/oklasupctruling.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] Tuesday that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion violates the state constitution. The law required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound within an hour of the procedure and contained sections on requirements for abortion clinic signs, the administration of an early-term abortion pill, and rules on lawsuits relating to abortions. The court held that the legislation &quot;facially, patently, and obviously contained multiple subjects,&quot; and therefore violates the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/index.asp?ftdb=STOKCN&level=1">Oklahoma constitution</a> [text], which requires legislation to be limited to one subject. The Oklahoma legislature is currently considering <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/hb2780_engr.rtf">other bills</a> [HB 2780, DOC] that separately contain much of same substance as the overturned law. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/about-us">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website], which brought the suit on behalf of a medical clinic, <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/oklahoma-supreme-court-finds-abortion-law-unconstitutional-upholds-state-district-court-d">praised</a> [press release] the court&#39;s decision, but expressed concern about the new bills being considered by the legislature.<br /><br />The court&#39;s decision affirmed a lower court <a href="/pdf/okabortiontranscript.pdf">ruling</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/oklahoma-judge-finds-broad-abortion-law.php">report</a>] issued last August. In February, Oklahoma state court judge Daniel Owens <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/court-strikes-down-intrusive-ok-abortion-law-declares-unconstitutional">ruled</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/oklahoma-judge-strikes-down-multi-part.php">report</a>] that a different <a href="http://www.sos.state.ok.us/documents/Legislation/52nd/2009/1R/HB/1595.pdf">state law</a> [HB 1595, PDF], making it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion based on the gender of a fetus and requiring numerous reporting requirements, also violated the state constitution&#39;s single subject requirement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The  <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday heard an <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=863889&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">unlawful prosecution case</a> [press release] brought by bankrupt oil company <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">Yukos</a> [JURIST news archive] against the Russian government for allegedly illegally prosecuting the company for tax violations. Representatives of Yukos said they brought the case in the ECHR because they believed that would not recieve a fair hearing in a Russian court. They are seeking USD <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iDBwibmbZ6UzoMiTVMdnC15Rj6HAD9E7UQQ00">$98 billion in damages</a> [AP report], the value of a subsidiary that a Russian court ordered Yukos to sell to in order to pay the liabilities. Yukos filed the <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=847416&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">claim</a> [text] with the ECHR in August 2004, alleging that tax assessments between 2002-03 &quot;had been arbitrary, unlawful and disproportionate&quot; and that the assessments &quot;had not been based on any reasonable and foreseeable interpretation of the domestic law.&quot;<br /><br />On Wednesday, Yukos founder <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Russian justice system as an &quot;assembly line&quot; that inevitably finds the government&#39;s political enemies to be guilty. Both he and former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are serving time on tax evasion and fraud charges, but Lebedev <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-high-court-to-review-arrest-of.php">successfully challenged</a> [JURIST report] the legality of his arrest and was awarded USD $14,300 in damages and legal fees by the EHCR. The two are currently on trial on <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">additional related charges</a> of money laundering and embezzlement, to which they have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/khodorkovsky-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports]. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition to former Russian president and current <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A German court in Dusseldorf on Thursday convicted four Islamists of conspiracy to murder and belonging to a foreign terrorist group for plotting to destroy US facilities within Germany. The four men, members of the radical <a href="http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/iju.html">Islamic Jihad Union</a> [NCTC backgrounder], were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/world/europe/06iht-06germany.7398171.html?_r=1">apprehended</a> [NYT report] in September 2007 while developing a plan to use three car bombs and 250kg of explosives on US targets. The attacks were planned to coincide with a vote in parliament on whether Germany should extend its military presence in Afghanistan. Fritz Gelowicz and Daniel Schneider, both German-born converts to Islam, were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gw4pReBHma-UoZbqcz9GGlASZrHgD9E7NNBO0">sentenced</a> [AP report] to 12 years in prison. The court also sentenced Adem Yilmaz, a Turkish citizen, to 11 years and Atilla Selek, a German citizen of Turkish origin, to five years. Although there are no formal pleas in German trials, all four mean submitted confessions in exchange for reduced sentencing.<br /><br />The 2007 arrest led to <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/germany-justice-minister-proposes-new.php">several additions</a> [JURIST report] to Germany&#39;s anti-terror laws, which were strengthened by Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s government following <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this week, Germany&#39;s high court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-high-court-overturns-data.php">overturned an anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] that allowed German authorities access to phone and e-mail data. The data would be stored for six months to be used by police agencies in criminal investigations. The court held that the law was unconstitutional and violated the privacy rights of German citizens. Merkel&#39;s government has recently received criticism for the effect anti-terror laws are having on the citizen&#39;s privacy rights, claiming a better balance needs to be established between privacy and security.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US lawmakers introduced a <a href="http://assets.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/politics/ARM10090.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] Thursday that would require the military interrogation and trial of those taken into US custody who are suspected of links to terrorism. The Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010 was introduced by Senators <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joe Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official websites] and would require that all people detained by US authorities, both domestically and internationally, who are suspected of engaging in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners or of providing material support for those who do, would be placed in military custody for interrogation and a final status determination made by the president, attorney general, and defense secretary. Under the bill, before a final status determination is made, the suspect cannot be Mirandized or &quot;otherwise ... informed of any rights that the individual may or may not have to counsel or to remain silent consistent with <u>Miranda v. Arizona</u>.&quot; If the detainee were then determined to be an &quot;unprivileged enemy belligerent,&quot; the bill would mandate detention until the end of the hostilities against the US by the group with which the suspect was involved or supporting. In a <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.FloorStatements&ContentRecord_id=2af60f3a-05dc-cdf6-7dc9-6501a995c17c">press release</a> [text], McCain explained:<br /><blockquote><br />[The legislation] sets forth a clear, comprehensive policy for the detention, interrogation and trial of enemy belligerents who are suspected of engaging in hostilities against the United States. This legislation seeks to ensure that the mistakes made during the apprehension of the Christmas Day bomber, such as reading him a Miranda warning, will never happen again and put Americans&#8217; security at risk.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/senators-mccain-and-lieberman-introduce-bill-authorize-indefinite-detention">criticized</a> [press release] the legislation, describing it as &quot;a direct attack on the Constitution.&quot; Senator <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-SC) [official website], who is currently working with the Obama administration to create a comprehensive system to deal with detainees that would include civilian trials, also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/04/mccain-lieberman-attempt-ban-civilian-trials-enemy-combatants/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+foxnews%252Fpolitics+%2528Text+-+Politics%2529">expressed reservations</a> [FOX News report] about the legislation.<br /><br />It was reported on Friday that White House advisers are <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that accused 9/11 co-conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced in November that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism. Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to charge suspected terrorist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8431530.stm">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>], the so-called Christmas Day bomber, in US federal court. Holder, who has resisted <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/29/rep-king-calls-military-tribunal-abdulmutallab/">calls from high-level Republicans</a> [AP Report] to try Abdulmutallab in front of a military tribunal, said that the civilian criminal justice system was capable of handling his trial. Abdulmutallab was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in January on six counts for allegedly attempting to set off an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bound from Amsterdam to Detroit. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">plea of not guilty</a> [JURIST report] was entered on his behalf.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm/biography">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/transcripts/oralevidence-bydate/100305.aspx">testified</a> [video] to the <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/">Iraq Inquiry</a> [official website] on Friday that he remains convinced that the decision to participate in the 2003 Iraq invasion was the appropriate course of action. Brown discussed his approval of military funding while serving as head of the <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/">Treasury</a> [official website] during the invasion as well as his later actions as prime minister. He stated that in the former capacity, he received information from intelligence agents that he deemed credible and &quot;led [him] to believe that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with.&quot; Brown explained that Saddam Hussein&#39;s refusal to comply with UN directives necessitated a response from the international community:<br /><blockquote><br />I believe we made the right decision for the right reasons, because the international community had for years asked Saddam Hussein to abide by international law and the international obligations that he had accepted. Fourteen resolutions were passed by the United Nations, and at the end of the day, it was impossible to persuade him that he should abide by international law. Now my feeling is and still is that we cannot have an international community that works if we have either terrorists who are breaking these rules or, in this case, aggressor states that refuse to obey the laws of the international community.<br /></blockquote><br />Brown also outlined three primary &quot;lessons&quot; from the invasion, stressing the importance of &quot;proper structures of decision making,&quot; securing a &quot;just peace,&quot; and increasing international cooperation in any future interventions. <br /><br />Last month, former UK Foreign Ministry secretary <a href="http://www.jackstrawmp.org.uk/Biography.asp">Jack Straw</a> [parliamentary profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-uk-foreign-minister-denies.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that he did not ignore legal advice that the invasion of Iraq lacked basis in international law. Former chief legal adviser to the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ha/notewriters/wood.pdf">Sir Michael Wood</a> [UN profile, PDF] told the Iraq Inquiry in January that he had advised the Foreign Ministry that the invasion was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/former-uk-legal-advisor-testifies-iraq.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Wood testified that the invasion was &quot;contrary to international law&quot; because it was never authorized by the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], and that Straw had rejected his advice at the time. Earlier in January, the Iraq Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/former-uk-ag-warned-cabinet-iraq.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a 2002 <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/42845/goldsmith-hoon-letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] from Goldsmith to former secretary of defense <a href="http://www.geoffhoonmp.co.uk/biog/">Geoffrey Hoon</a> [personal profile] in which he warned the Cabinet that the Iraq invasion was not supported by international law. Former UK prime minister <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/blair.php">news archive</a>] is also facing criticism over the legality of the Iraq War. In testimony to the Iraq Inquiry, former UK international development secretary Clare Short said that Blair was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-uk-cabinet-member-claims-blair.php">&quot;misleading&quot; and &quot;deceitful&quot;</a> [JURIST report] with the Cabinet and parliament regarding the Iraq invasion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/CRPDIndex.aspx">UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> (CRPD) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9873&LangID=E">announced</a> [press release] on Friday the creation of a working group of rights experts to monitor the support offered to disabled Haitians as they attempt to recover from the damage caused by the January <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/info/haiti-earthquake-2010/">earthquake</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">news archive</a>]. The group will focus on ensuring that rights of disabled people receive attention as the country moves forward. The CRPD emphasized the importance of the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=13&pid=150">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [materials] in creating the group. The CRPD said, &#8220;states are to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, and natural disaster like the occurrence of this earthquake.&#8221; The working group will also address rights of disabled persons in other countries that have suffered the effects of natural disasters, including individuals in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/world/americas/28chile.html">Chile</a> [NYT report]. The CRPD offered a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9809&LangID=E">statement</a> [text] last month urging that the Haitian government, as well as other organizations assisting in the relief effort, provide the disabled, elderly and other vulnerable groups with preferential treatment in obtaining certain necessities.<br /><br />Following the Haiti earthquake, observers have stressed the importance of <a href="/hotline/2010/02/haitis-reconstruction-must-proceed-with.php">promoting human rights</a> [JURIST comment] during the rebuilding process. In January, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-urges-improved.php">strengthening human rights</a> [JURIST report] is an integral part of the rebuilding process in Haiti. Earlier in January, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-approves-tax-benefit-for-haiti.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will allow US citizens to claim donations to Haitian relief efforts as a deduction on their 2009 tax returns. Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] announced that Haitian nationals present in the US before the earthquake will be given temporary protected status and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">will not be deported</a> for the next 18 months, but Haitian refugees who arrive in the US illegally will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-earthquake-refugees-may-not.php">sent back to their home country</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/rumsfeld_suit.pdf">denied</a> [decision, PDF] a motion to dismiss a torture suit brought against former defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] by two American citizens captured while working in Iraq. Judge Wayne Andersen dismissed two other counts but allowed the count alleging the plaintiffs were subject to cruel and degrading treatment methods during their detention. The plaintiffs, Donald Vance and Nathan Ertel, were working for a private Iraqi security firm called Shield Group Security. There they witnessed suspicious activity that they reported to US authorities, but they were later arrested by US forces and detained without representation. The plaintiffs brought a cause of action recognized in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text] against Rumsfeld, claiming that he was personally responsible for the alleged unconstitutional treatment they faced while in detention. While allowing the suit seems in conflict with the recent decision in <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-ashcroft-immunity.php">Ashcroft v. Iqbal</a> [JURIST report], which extended heightened pleading requirements under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule8.htm">Fed. R. Civ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Fiji High Court sentenced eight men to prison terms ranging from three to seven years for plotting the assassination of the leader of the country&#39;s military government on Friday. The sentencing judge, Justice Paul Madigan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8552721.stm">chastised the men</a> [BBC report] for their greed and racial motivations in the plot to assassinate <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/769527.stm">Prime Minister Commodore Josaia Voreqe Frank Bainimarama</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bainimarama">news archive</a>], in 2007. The court described the plot as involving the assassination of Bainimarama, the removal of the president and the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2d914d,47d6545121,0.html">Indo-Fijians</a> [UNHCR backgrounder], and the declaration of martial law, during which the plot leaders would request assistance from New Zealand and Australia. The two longest sentences were given to Chief Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, a leader of Naitasiri province, and former Pacific Connex employee Sivaniolo Naulago, who <a href="http://www.radiofiji.com.fj/fullstory.php?id=26214">both received seven years</a> [FBC report]. The others convicted were former soldiers Barbados Mills, who received six-and-a-half years, Feoko Gadikibau, who was sentenced to five-and-a-half years, Kaminieli Vosavere, who was sentenced to four years, Eparama Waqatairewa and Pauliasi Ramulo, who were each sentenced to three years, and former head of <a href="http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=82492">Fiji Military Intelligence</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Times</span> report] Metuisela Mua, who was sentenced to three-and-a-half years. The men were initially <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fiji-charges-three-with-attempted.php">arrested and charged</a> with the plot in 2007, eleven months after the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/fijian-military-carries-out-coup.php">2006 military coup</a> [JURIST reports]. Five of those <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gGRbQTcA85ID2bWhuPKSr0TiIBuA">sentenced Friday</a> [AFP report] were part of a military unit that had mutinied against Bainimarama in 2000.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.thecommonwealth.org/">Commonwealth of Nations</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/fiji-suspended-from-commonwealth-for.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] Fiji from its organization in September because it failed to meet the September 1 deadline for reinstating a constitutional democracy and opening a national dialogue. The <a href="http://www.forumsec.org/index.cfm">Pacific Islands Forum</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/fiji-suspended-from-16-nation-bloc.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] Fiji&#39;s membership in the 16-nation bloc in May after Fiji&#39;s current military government failed to meet a May 1 deadline to schedule elections. Bainimarama <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/fiji-pm-announces-plan-for-new.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] in July to establish a new constitution by September 2013. Bainimarama said that the new constitution would be in place at least one year prior to the elections planned for September 2014. In April, former president Ratu Josefa Iloilo <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/fiji-president-suspends-constitution.php">suspended the constitution</a> and revoked the appointment of all judicial officers after a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/fiji-appeals-court-declares-post-coup.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] from the Fiji Court of Appeal declaring the appointment of the military government following the 2006 coup unconstitutional. Bainimarama took control in the wake of the coup, which ousted former Fijian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1535214.stm">Laisenia Qarase</a> [BBC profile].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://www.robnicholsonmp.ca/EN/3302/">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson</a> [official profile] announced Friday that a former <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] judge will review documents detailing Canadian forces&#39; treatment of Afghan detainees before the documents are released to <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/index.asp?Language=E&Parl=40&ses=3">Parliament</a> [official website]. Nicholson appointed former judge <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/iacobucci/iacobucci.html">Frank Iacobucci</a> [UToronto backgrounder] to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/03/05/nat-detainee-review.html">review the documents</a> [CBC report] and report back to Nicholson, who will determine the conditions of disclosure. The announcement comes amidst mounting pressure from Parliament for the release of the documents. In December, Parliament passed an <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/canadian-opposition-measure-seeks.php">order to compel</a> [JURIST report] Prime Minister Stephen Harper to release the documents, and earlier this week, some MPs <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/03/01/13073756.html">considered a vote to sanction</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Sun</span> report] high-level cabinet ministers for refusing to disclose them. MP <a href="http://www.derekleemp.ca/main/">Derek Lee</a> (Liberal) [official website] has <a href="http://www.derekleemp.ca/main/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100:breaches-of-parliamentary-privilege-the-power-of-the-house-of-commons-to-send-for-persons-papers-and-records&catid=35:derek-lee-mp-press-releases&Itemid=79">criticized</a> [press release] the refusal to disclose the documents, which may contain evidence that detainees were tortured.<br /><br />In December, the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/canada-government-releases-e-mails.php">released</a> [JURIST report] more than 40 <a href="http://www.bccla.org/antiterrorissue/ColvinDocs3.pdf">redacted e-mails</a> [text, PDF] sent by Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin to then-foreign minister <a href="http://www.petermackay.ca/meet_peter.php">Peter MacKay</a> [official profile] raising concerns about the torture of transferred detainees. The release of the e-mails came after Colvin <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senior-canada-diplomat-accuses-military.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before a Commons committee in November that all enemy combatants captured in 2006 and 2007 by Canadian forces were likely tortured upon their transfer to Afghan authorities. Throughout the spring of 2006, Colvin relayed allegations made by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [official website] that Afghan authorities were routinely torturing detainees, and that by refusing information requests and failing to provide timely notice of transfer to Afghan custody, the Canadian military was hindering efforts to track Afghan detainees and monitor their treatment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The president of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] said Thursday that Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] will eventually <a href="http://www.henryjacksonsociety.org/stories.asp?pageid=49&id=1395">face justice</a> [prepared remarks] in The Hague. Speaking in London before the British <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/presidency/the%20president/judge%20sang_hyun%20song%20_republic%20of%20korea__%20president?lan=en-GB">Judge Sang-Hyun Song</a> [official profile] addressed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant&page=2">controversy</a> [JURIST news archive] surrounding the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] issued one year ago:<br /><blockquote><br />The Rome Statute created the possibility for a political body &#8211; the Security Council &#8211; to refer situations to the Court. In the case of Darfur, this is what happened in March 2005. Once a situation comes before the Court, we must let justice follow its course. States must accept that judges cannot and will not take political considerations into account.<br /></blockquote><br />Responding to questions, Song went on to <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/ICC%20Sudan%20Bashir%20justice/-/1066/873570/-/98271az/-/index.html">compare</a> [Reuters report] the al-Bashir warrant with the successful surrender of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4637789-103684,00.html">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Guardian</font> obituary; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">Charles Taylor</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>] to the international criminal tribunals. Addressing supporters, al-Bashir said that he would <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article34325">continue to travel</a> [ST report] despite the warrant, though he declined an invitation to attend extraordinary summit of the <a href="http://igad.int/">Inter-Governmental Authority on Development</a> (IGAD) [official website] in Nairobi next week.<br /><br />In February, the ICC Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trial Chamber to reconsider adding an additional charge of genocide to the al-Bashir warrant. ICC prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-prosecutors-appeal-decision-not-to.php">appealed the decision</a> [JURIST report] not to charge al-Bashir with genocide in July. The warrant, which charges al-Bashir with seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, has been a source of tension, with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-joins-calls-for-icc-to-delay.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> [JURIST reports], and others calling for the proceedings against al-Bashir to be delayed, and African Union leaders <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/au-leaders-agree-not-to-cooperate-with.php">agreeing</a> [JURIST report] not to cooperate with the ruling.  Al-Bashir is accused of systematically targeting and purging the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa, three Arabic-speaking ethnic groups, under the pretext of counterinsurgency since 2003.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] White House advisers are considering recommending that accused 9/11 co-conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system, according to Friday reports. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030405209.html">reported</a> [WP report] that Obama&#39;s legal advisers are finishing their review of the Mohammed file, and CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/05/911.trial/?hpt=T2">confirmed</a> [CNN report] that a military tribunal is still an option. Authorities have been unable to decide where to try Mohammed, with many Republicans and New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official profile] opposed to holding the trial in a civilian court in Manhattan. Many groups also oppose trying the suspects in military tribunals, with the <a href="www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/obama-administration-verge-reversing-decision-911-prosecutions">saying</a> [press release] that despite recent improvements:<br /><blockquote><br />the military commissions system is incapable of handling complicated terrorism cases and achieving reliable results. President Obama must not cave in to political pressure and fear-mongering. He should hold firm and keep these prosecutions in federal court, where they belong.<br /></blockquote><br />While no official recommendation has been given to Obama, administration officials hope a decision will be made by March 18. <br /><br />Just last month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-praises-role-of-civilian-courts.php">praised the role</a> [JURIST report] of the civilian criminal justice system in obtaining a guilty plea from suspected terrorist Najibullah Zazi. Holder also <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-flexible-on-trying-911-suspects.php">said</a> [JURIST report] last month that he is flexible on whether Mohammed will be tried in a military commission or the civilian criminal system. The possibility of a civilian trial, first <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November, has received backlash from both New York City officials and members of Congress, including some who support closing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Haitian judge on Monday ordered the release of one of the last two US missionaries out of a group of 10 who were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-citizens-arrested-after-trying-to.php">arrested on kidnapping charges</a> [JURIST report] following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">January 12 earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive]. The judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-judge-to-release-two-missionaries.php">announced</a> last month that both missionaries would be released, following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-judge-orders-release-of-8-us.php">release</a> [JURIST reports] of the other eight members of the missionary group affiliated with the <a href="http://www.centralvalleybaptist.net/cvbc09/splash/haiti_statement.cfm?CFID=37667851&CFTOKEN=26943684">Central Valley Baptist Church</a> [church website] of Idaho and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8490843.stm">New Life Children&#39;s Refuge Charity</a> [BBC profile]. Charisa Coulter was released from prison Monday, while Laura Silsby, the group&#39;s leader remains behind bars. Silsby and Coulter have consistently denied any wrongdoing and said they only sought to help children who were suffering after the quake.  <br /><br />The Americans were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-officials-charge-10-americans.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with their attempt to take 33 children across the Haitian border into the Dominican Republic, where the group stated they hoped to start an orphanage. Haitian authorities asserted, however, that many of the children were not orphans, but had been given up by their parents when the missionaries promised a better life for the children. The 10 were each charged with one count of kidnapping and one count of criminal association. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake caused massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti, and the death toll has been estimated at 230,000.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Nigerian government must <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/08/nigeria-investigate-massacre-step-patrols">investigate the recent killings</a> [press release] of more than 200 Christian villagers and prosecute those responsible, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Monday. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8555018.stm">Attacks</a> [BBC report] blamed on Muslim herders took place near the city of Jos over the weekend, in apparent retaliation for violence between Muslims and Christians in January. HRW called on acting President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8510390.stm">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] to &quot;ensure that the military and the police act swiftly to protect civilians of all ethnicities at risk of further attacks or reprisal killings, including by conducting regular patrols throughout the vulnerable region.&quot; UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The job facing the security forces and the judiciary is extremely sensitive. It is important to avoid stimulating new resentments, while at the same time ensuring that those responsible for these atrocious acts do not escape justice. This is the third round of deadly violence in the Jos region in three years, leading to a total number of deaths that may exceed 1,000. Clearly, previous efforts to tackle the underlying causes have been inadequate, and in the meantime the wounds have festered and grown deeper</blockquote>Jonathan responded to the January violence by deploying more troops to the region, but HRW says the patrols have failed to protect many smaller communities.<br /><br />Last month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/rights-group-urges-nigeria-acting.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Jonathan to to &quot;tackle the culture of impunity&quot; in Nigeria. HRW&#39;s letter came just days after Jonathan <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-vp-takes-over-for-ailing.php">assumed the presidency</a> [JURIST report] in place of ailing president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6187249.stm">Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile]. Yar&#39;Adua, who suffers from a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8829592">heart condition</a> [AP report], was taken to a hospital in Saudi Arabia in November. He has since <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8533380.stm">returned to Nigeria</a> [BBC report] but has not resumed his duties as president. While HRW has called on Jonathan directly, other rights groups have petitioned international authorities to take action to prevent recurring rights abuses. Earlier in February, the <a href="http://www.serap-nigeria.org/">Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project</a> (SERAP) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-rights-group-urges-icc-to.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] investigation into the violence that took place in Jos in January. The ICC is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-considering-investigation-into.php">considering</a> [JURIST report] the petition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/030810zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in three cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-751.htm">Snyder v. Phelps</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-751_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will take up the controversial issue of picketing the funerals of soldiers killed in combat. Reverend Fred Phelps and members of the <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [church website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=westboro">news archive</a>] have been traveling around the country picketing military funerals in recent years, claiming US soldiers have been killed because America tolerates homosexuals. The court has been asked to consider three issues:<blockquote>1. Does <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0485_0046_ZS.html">Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell</a> [opinion text] apply to a private person versus another private person concerning a private matter?<br /><br />2. Does the First Amendment&#39;s freedom of speech tenet trump the First Amendment&#39;s freedom of religion and peaceful assembly?<br /><br />3. Does an individual attending a family member&#39;s funeral constitute a captive audience who is entitled to state protection from unwanted communication?</blockquote>The <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-lawsuit-filed-against-military.php">suit was brought</a> [JURIST report] by the family of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder after Phelps and members of his church picketed his funeral. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-jury-orders-military-funeral.php">awarded the family</a> [JURIST report] almost $11 million in damages, but the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.P.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that Phelps&#39;s speech was protected under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text].<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-152.htm">Bruesewitz v. Wyeth</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-152_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/300aa-22.html">&sect; 22(b)(1)</a> [text] of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which expressly preempts certain design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers &quot;if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings,&quot; preempts all vaccine design defect claims. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073794p.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the act preempts all design defect claims.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-530.htm">National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/09-530_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether the government violates a federal contract employee&#39;s constitutional right to informational privacy when it asks in the course of a background investigation whether the employee has received counseling or treatment for illegal drug use that has occurred within the past year. The court will also consider whether the government violates a federal contract employee&#39;s constitutional right to informational privacy when it asks the employee&#39;s designated references for any adverse information that may have a bearing on the employee&#39;s suitability for employment at a federal facility. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the government had violated the employee&#39;s right to privacy, and <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/10/07-56424o.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] a petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The top rights official at the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1593841&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">rejected</a> [press release] the notion of banning Muslim <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and niqab garments. Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile] noted in a written <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Viewpoints/100308_en.asp">statement</a> [text] marking <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com/">International Women&#39;s Day</a> [official website]: <blockquote>Those who have argued for a general ban of the burqa and the niqab have not managed to show that these garments in any way undermine democracy, public safety, order or morals. The fact that a very small number of women wear such clothing has made proposals in such a direction even less convincing. <br /><br />Nor has it been possible to prove that these women in general are victims of more gender repression than others. Those who have been interviewed in the media have presented a diversity of religious, political and personal arguments for their decision to dress themselves as they do. There may of course be cases where they are under undue pressure - but it is not shown that a ban would be welcomed by these women.</blockquote>Hammarberg stressed that European governments considering bans on burqas and niqabs should first look to Articles 8 and 9 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] before making any decision. <br /><br />Hammarberg&#39;s remarks come as fierce debate continues in France and other European nations over the legality of banning traditional Muslim body coverings. Last month, French political candidate <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-womens-group-takes-legal-action.php">Ilham Moussaid</a> [JURIST report] ignited controversy by running for office on a left-wing platform while wearing a headscarf. In January, a French parliamentary commission recommended <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-parliamentary-commission.php">banning the burqa</a> [JURIST report] in public places. Currently, headscarves are banned in French schools.

The measure, passed by a <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/news/international/article223174.ece">vote of 93-24</a> [<em>Hindu</em> report], was opposed by the Janatha Vimukthi Perumana, the country&#39;s main opposition party. <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-president-dissolves.php">dissolved parliament</a> [JURIST report] in February to prepare for the April elections, but, under the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/CONTENTS.html">Constitution</a> [text], the president&#39;s emergency powers can only be extended for one month at a time, and the extension must be approved by parliament within ten days of the president&#39;s declaration. Rajapaksa announced last week that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sri-lanka-president-reconvenes.php">reconvene parliament</a> [JURIST report] to seek an extension of emergency powers, claiming that the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elan</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] still pose a threat, despite an end to the country&#39;s decades-long civil war last May.<br /><br />Last month, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-refuses-to-release.php">rejected</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-to-review-legality.php">petition</a> [JURIST reports] to release opposition presidential candidate and former general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8356676.stm">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile], who is being held over an alleged coup plot. It is believed that Rajapaksa called early parliamentary elections to harness momentum from the presidential election in January, in which he defeated Fonseka, to gain more seats in parliament for his political party, Freedom Alliance. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruled last month that Rajapaksa&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-rules-presidents.php">second term</a> [JURIST report] will begin in November. The apparent victor in January&#39;s elections, Rajapaksa defeated Fonseka by an official margin of 18 points, winning re-election to a second term in office. Fonseka has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/02/20102816287441879.html">disputed</a> [Al Jazeera report] the results, saying violence and vote-counting irregularities invalidated the outcome. Sri Lanka has been under a state of emergency for most of the past 27 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Italian appeals court on Friday upheld the convictions of 15 police officers, prison guards, and medical staff <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-officials-convicted-of-abusing.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of abusing anti-globalization protesters taken into custody during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1451845.stm">2001 G8 summit in Genoa</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=genoa+g8">news archive</a>]. The court also reversed the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-court-acquits-majority-of-police.php">acquittals</a> [JURIST report] of 29 others. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/convictions-abuse-during-genoa-g8-protests-upheld-2010-03-08">noted</a> [press release] that &quot;the lack of the crime of torture in the Italian criminal code has prevented judges from punishing perpetrators in a manner proportionate to the gravity of the conduct attributed to them,&quot; and called on Italian authorities to introduce a crime of torture. None of the convicted will serve any prison time because of the expired statute of limitations for lesser crimes. The director of Amnesty International&#39;s Europe and Central Asia Programme nonetheless called the ruling, &quot;an important step towards ensuring accountability for some of the grave human rights violations occurred in Genoa in 2001.&quot;<br /><br />In August, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=853404&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&tabl">ruled</a> [judgment text] that Italy was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/europe-rights-court-rules-2001-italian.php">negligent</a> [JURIST report] in completing an accurate investigation of the death of a protester at the 2001 G8 summit. The court awarded 40,000 euros to the family of Carlo Giuliani, the protester who died after being shot by an Italian police officer as his van was mobbed. On the night of July 21, 2001, police forces conducted a raid on the Diaz school, which was being used as headquarters by some of the protesters. Over the course of the summit as a whole, more than 100 protesters were injured and one was killed. Immediately after the protests and reports of abuse, AI <a href="http://www.dyne.org/antig8/text/amnesty-release.html">called for a full investigation</a> [press release] into the mistreatment. In July 2006, the group urged the Italian government to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGEUR300052006&lang=e">institute reforms to prevent future abuses</a> [press release], but said that the government had not done so in the five years since the incident.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vietnamese human rights lawyer and activist <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/individuals-at-risk/write-for-rights/tw-hrds">Le Thi Cong Nhan</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thi+Cong+Nhan+">news archive</a>] was released from prison on Saturday after serving a three-year sentence for allegedly spreading propaganda against the state. Although she has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmqXRKLsLd-gV-nIAt9__rlZIztgD9EAFJRO1">released</a> [AP report] from jail, she will now serve an additional three years of house arrest. Nhan was convicted and imprisoned in 2007 for allegedly violating <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/vn/legis/pc66/s88.html">Article 88</a> [text] of the Vietnamese criminal code by advocating for a multi-party system in Vietnam with her activism, which included posting articles on the Internet and hosting discussions on human rights law. Nhan was convicted alongside another human rights lawyer, Nguyen Van Dai who is still serving his jail sentence.<br /><br />Nhan and Dai were <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/vietnam-rights-lawyers-arrested-after.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in early 2007 after hosting a discussion on human rights. They were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/vietnam-rights-lawyer-sentenced-for-pro.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reprot] a few months later of spreading propaganda against the state, and Nhan was sentenced to four years in prison while Dai was convicted to five. In late 2007, an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/vietnam-appeals-court-cuts-jail-terms.php">lowered</a> [JURIST report] their sentences by a year, citing both lawyers&#39;s lack of a prior criminal record and because their activism had not yet caused serious damage to the country. During their appeal, both lawyers challenged the Vietnamese government&#39;s lack of democracy and human rights. Le Cong Dhin, who represented Nhan in 2007, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted and jailed</a> in January on unrelated <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/vietnam-pro-democracy-lawyer-arrested.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of subversion for allegedly &quot;colluding with foreign reactionaries to sabotage the Vietnamese state.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar&#39;s military junta on Tuesday <a href="http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/index.html">unveiled</a> [NLM report] the first of five laws that will set the stage for the country&#39;s first election in 20 years. The Union Election Commission Law, the first of the five laws <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/2010394417778884.html">enacted</a> [Al Jazeera report] Monday to be published in state-run newspapers, states that the military government will appoint the five-member commission that will supervise and have the final say on all electoral matters. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gR7Ynyd2tM3aj2CQ75jX3joFYjXQD9EAM0680">remaining four laws</a> [AP report] cover the polls for the Pyithu Hluttaw, or House of Representatives; the polls for the Amyotha Hluttaw, or House of Nationalities, the other house of parliament; the polls for Region and State parliaments; and the Political Parties Registration Law.  The <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website], the opposition party of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>], has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYm5aNyYP5Jptb530N8Rs_pAiEiQ">not committed</a> [AFP report] to taking part in the polls, claiming that the 2008 constitution is unfair because it bans Suu Kyi from taking part in the polls and reserves a quarter of parliamentary seats for the military.<br /><br />Last month, UN High Representative for Human Rights <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-court-sentences-monk-to-7-years.php">expressed great disappointment</a> [JURIST report] during his visit to Myanmar, stating that without certain action the elections &quot;will not be credible.&quot;  Quintana met with 15 prisoners during visits to three prisons, but his requests to meet with imprisoned opposition leader Suu Kyi and junta leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3755684.stm">Senior General Than Shwe</a> [BBC profile] were denied. The ruling military junta <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-frees-opposition-vice-chairman.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 82-year old democracy activist U Tin Oo, a decorated general and Vice-Chairman of the NLD, from six years of house arrest just days before Quintana&#39;s arrival. Thant Zin Oo, the general&#39;s son, said the release was a <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17797">calculated political move</a> [<em>Irrawaddy</em> report] designed to appease the UN. The government of Myanmar announced last year that it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/myanmar-to-release-political-prisoners.php">processing grants of immunity</a> [JURIST report] to allow prisoners to participate in the upcoming elections. <a href="http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/ministry/home/default.htm">Home Minister Major General Maung Oo</a> [official website] announced in January that Suu Kyi will be <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">released from house arrest</a> [JURIST report] in November when her sentence is scheduled to expire. The announcement has been seen as an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/25/AR2010012500660.html">indication</a> [AP report] that she will not be allowed to participate in the elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/index.htm">National People&#39;s Congress</a> (NPC) [official website, in Chinese] on Monday opened consideration of election reforms designed to afford equal representation to residents of rural and urban administrative areas. China&#39;s current electoral law provides more congressional representatives to residents of urban districts than residents of rural ones. The draft amendment aims to eliminate the disparity in representation. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee Wang Zhaoguo offered this <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6912645.html">rationale</a> [text] for the presentation of the draft amendment:<br /><blockquote><br />Since 1995, China&#39;s industrialization and urbanization have accelerated further, the economic and cultural level in rural areas has increased dramatically, and profound changes have taken place in the social structure. The urban population in China has increased from 29.04% in 1995 to 46.6% in 2009. At the same time, people&#39;s congresses at all levels have gone through many terms of elections, accumulated abundant experience, achieved enormous results in developing socialist democratic politics and a socialist legal system, and the class base and mass foundation for the people&#39;s democratic dictatorship led by the Party has been consolidated and expanded. The objective conditions are in place for revising the Electoral Law and electing deputies to the people&#39;s congresses based on the same population ratio in urban and rural areas.<br /></blockquote><br />Currently, 960,000 rural residents receive the same representation as 240,000 urban residents, leading to calls for reform.<br /><br />Deliberation over the measure will continue in the <a href="http://www.npc.cn/englishnpc/Special_11_3/index.htm">Third Session</a> [official website] of the Eleventh National People&#39;s Congress from March 5-14 in Beijing. Also on the <a href="http://www.npc.cn/englishnpc/Special_11_3/2010-03/04/content_1548782.htm">agenda</a> [text] are budgetary, social, and economic development measures. Despite reforms, China continues to face international criticism over human rights issues. The government decided in February to tighten <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on Internet use. China has also received criticism for its treatment of rights lawyer <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gao+Zhisheng">news archive</a>], who was last seen in public on February 4, 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian Federal Court ruled Monday that the 1998 removal of opposition leader <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/inner.asp?z=3">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] as deputy prime minister was constitutional. Anwar had challenged his removal on the grounds that the removal was unconstitutional because then-prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who fired Anwar alleging that he had notified the king, lacked the authority to do so. According to Malaysia&#39;s <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/malaysia.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF], &quot;the appointment of any Minister shall have been revoked by the [constitutional monarch] on the advice of the Prime Minister...&quot; The three-judge panel of the Federal Court unanimously <a href="http://www.mmail.com.my/content/29538-court-anwars-sacking-cabinet-posts-valid">rejected</a> [<em>Malay Mail</em> report] Anwar&#39;s claim, reasoning that the Agong, or constitutional monarch, has very limited powers to appoint ministers, and that his role is only a formality. The judges also emphasized that no provision in the laws specifies procedures to remove a minister. Anwar&#39;s counsel, Karpal Singh, <a href="http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/55602-federal-court-upholds-anwars-sacking-as-constitutional">commented</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Malaysian Insider</span> report] that the judgment renders the prime minister&#39;s powers akin to those of a dictator.<br /><br />Anwar is currently facing trial on sodomy charges after his appeal to dismiss the charges was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-appeals-court-refuses-to.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] in February. Anwar is charged of sodomizing his former aid Mohamad Saiful Bukhari Azlan in 2008. He contends that the charge is a politically-motivated government conspiracy seeking to undermine his political career, and has <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-opposition-leader-enters-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report]. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s deputy prime minister until he was fired and then jailed in 1998 following corruption and sodomy charges, of which he was acquitted in 2004. He recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>] that attorneys are considered debt relief agencies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ008.109">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act</a> (BAPCPA) [text] when they provide qualifying services. The court also held that the BAPCPA, which requires certain disclosures in advertisements, does not violate attorneys&#39; <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/08-1119_lower_op.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that, while bankruptcy attorneys meet the definition of a debt relief agency, the BAPCPA provisions codified in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_00000526----000-.html">11 USC &sect; 526(a)(4)</a> [text] are unconstitutional as applied to attorneys. In partially reversing the opinion below, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote:<blockquote>Because &sect; 528&#39;s requirements that Milavetz identify itself as a debt relief agency and include certain information about its bankruptcy-assistance and related services are &quot;reasonably related to the [Government&#39;s] interest in preventing deception of consumers,&quot; we uphold those provisions as applied to Milavetz.</blockquote>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas filed separate opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.<br /><br />The case arose when Minnesota law firm <a href="http://www.milavetzlaw.com/">Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, PA</a> [firm website] filed suit against the US government seeking a declaratory judgment that attorneys were not debt relief agencies under the BAPCPA and that certain provisions of the BAPCPA were unconstitutional as applied to attorneys. The district court ruled in favor of Milavetz, and the appeals court affirmed in part and reversed in part, causing both parties to appeal to the Supreme Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands of Spaniards gathered Sunday to protest <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-senate-gives-final-approval-to.php">recently approved changes</a> [JURIST report] to Spain&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] laws. Protesters marched in cities across Spain to <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/movimiento/antiaborto/languidece/elpepusoc/20100308elpepisoc_4/Tes">protest the new law</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish], which will allow abortion up to 14 weeks in most cases. <a href="http://marchavida.derechoavivir.org/">Organizers</a> [advocacy website] in Madrid estimated that <a href="http://www.hazteoir.org/node/28635">as many as 600,000 people</a> [press release, in Spanish] took part in the protests. Pro-life activists urged the conservative <a href="http://www.pp.es/">Popular Party</a> (PP) [party website, in Spanish] to make good on promises to seek the law&#39;s repeal. The new law, set to take effect on July 5, replaces the current law dating back to 1985, which allowed abortions only in the case of rape, up to 12 weeks, severe fetal malformation, up to 22 weeks, or if the woman&#39;s physical or mental health was in danger.<br /><br />The Spanish <a href="http://www.senado.es/index.html">Senate</a> [official website, in Spanish] gave final approval to the law last month. Spain&#39;s lower house of parliament, the <a href="http://www.congreso.es/">Congress of Deputies</a> [official website, in Spanish], <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/spain-congress-approves-bill-easing.php">passed</a> the bill in December after it received <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-council-of-state-approves.php">approval</a> [JURIST reports] from the Council of State in September. In October, hundreds of thousands of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-protesters-oppose-relaxation-of.php">protesters rallied in Madrid</a> [JURIST report] in opposition to the proposed legislation. The changes were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-panel-proposes-sweeping-abortion.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] last March by a panel of legal and medical experts led by <a href="http://www.migualdad.es/ss/Satellite?pagename=MinisterioIgualdad/Page/MIGU_home">Minister of Equality Bibiano Aido</a> [official website, in Spanish], eliciting widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-abortion-law-proposed-changes.php">protests</a> [JURIST report] throughout Spain. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-panel-to-consider-abortion-law.php">panel was formed</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008 at the request of <a href="http://www.la-moncloa.es/Presidente/Biografia/default.htm">Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero</a> [official profile, in Spanish] as part of a series of social reforms that have included <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] and streamlined divorce proceedings. The PP has repeatedly <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/PP/aborto/elpepuopi/20090220elpepiopi_6/Tes">expressed the opinion</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</font> report, in Spanish] that relaxed abortion laws would stand in opposition to <a href="http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/empleo/anexos/estatico/1_569_0.pdf">Article 15 of the Spanish Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which guarantees the right to life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Thai <a href="http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/">Cabinet</a> [official website, in Thai] on Tuesday approved the invocation of the Internal Security Act (ISA) to allow for increased security measures in anticipation of large anti-government protests. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8557069.stm">law</a> [BBC report] will provide more power to security forces and allow for the movement of protesters to be restricted through the imposition of curfews, checkpoints, and restrictions on the size of gatherings, in the event demonstrations turn violent. The law will <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20100309/thailand_security_100309/20100309?hub=World">be in effect</a> [AP report] in the capital of Bangkok and the surrounding provinces from March 11 to March 23. The protests that sparked the effort to increase security are being planned by the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), or the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], supporters of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was removed from power in 2006 following a coup. The group has called for a peaceful march to begin throughout the nation on Friday and culminate in Bangkok on Sunday.<br /><br />Last month, the Thai Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/thailand-court-seizes-assets-from.php">seized</a> [JURIST report] 46.4 billion baht (USD $1.4 billion) in assets from Thaksin for abuses of power while in office. Thaksin has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">convicted</a> of corruption in Thailand, but Cambodia has <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cambodia-refuses-to-extradite-former.php">refused</a> [JURIST reports] to extradite him. Last April, current Thai <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [BBC profile] instituted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/thailand-pm-imposes-state-of-emergency.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and several provinces following an outbreak of protests lead by the UDD calling for his resignation. He also <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/PR-StatementRelatedSummit.pdf">canceled</a> [press release] the summit of the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of South-East Asian Nations</a> [official website] leaders, which was being held in the country. Abhisit called for an inquiry into the violent clashes sparked by the UDD protests, in which two died and more than 100 were injured.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China and India agreed Tuesday to endorse the non-binding <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF], which calls for self-imposed limits on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greenhouse+gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Some 100 countries have already <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/world/10climate.html">agreed</a> [NYT report] to be associated with the non-binding accord, which arose from the <a href="http://www.denmark.dk/en/menu/Climate-Energy/COP15-Copenhagen-2009/cop15.htm">UN Climate Change Conference</a> (COP15) [official website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/no-legally-binding-agreement-on-climate.php">report</a>] held in Copenhagen in December. China and India, nations that are among the world&#39;s largest and most quickly growing producers of greenhouse gas emissions, were the last major players to sign on to the agreement. Their delay caused some concern about the agreement&#39;s credibility and potential future impact.<br /><br />The <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-climate-change-talks-to-resume-in.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in February that another round of formal climate talks will be held April 9-11 in Bonn, Germany, to follow up on the recent Copenhagen conference. While no legally-binding agreement was reached at the conclusion of the COP15 in December, 192 UN member countries agreed to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33305&Cr=Copenhagen&Cr1=">&quot;take note&quot;</a> [press release] of the non-binding accord developed by leaders from the US, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa in an effort to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. In January, more than 50 countries, including the US, China, and EU member states, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/more-than-50-countries-submit-climate.php">submitted plans</a> [JURIST report] to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC. Relative to 2005 levels, the US has pledged to reduce emissions to 17 percent, while China has targeted a 40 to 45 percent reduction per GDP unit. EU members pledged a 20 percent reduction below 1990 levels.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] on Tuesday urged the Obama administration to hold civilian trials for accused <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> conspirators, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archives]. Scheinin <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6283I420100309">called</a> [Reuters report] the <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] system &quot;fatally flawed&quot; and said that reforming the system would not help. Meanwhile, UN Special Rapporteur on torture <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/docs/cvnowak.doc">Manfred Nowak</a> [official profile, DOC] also argued that the suspects should face a civilian trial. A White House official said Monday that while a civilian trial for Mohammed may no longer be a realistic option, the Obama administration is working with lawmakers to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hmRe7ynsnjvNQvKihRMO7zysMWsQD9EAMHQ00">allow for civilian trials</a> [AP report] for other suspected terrorists.<br /><br />On Sunday, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] released a full-page <a href="http://www.aclu.org/aclu-ad-what-will-it-be-mr-president">advertisement</a> [image] in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, imploring President Barack Obama to fulfill his pledge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">try suspected 9/11 terrorists in federal courts</a> [JURIST report]. It was reported on Friday that White House advisers are <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. Attorney General Eric Holder announced in November that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism. Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to charge suspected terrorist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [JURIST news archive], the so-called Christmas Day bomber, in US federal court. Holder, who has <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/29/rep-king-calls-military-tribunal-abdulmutallab/">resisted calls from high-level Republicans</a> [AP Report] to try Abdulmutallab in front of a military tribunal, said that the civilian criminal justice system was capable of handling his trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/about/index.html">Governor Gary Herbert</a> (R) [official profile] <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=3017">signed a bill</a> [press release] into law on Monday that would allow a woman to be charged with criminal homicide if she arranges for an illegal abortion. Bill <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2010/bills/hbillenr/hb0462.pdf">HB 462</a> [text, PDF] defines abortion and states that &quot;[t]he killing or attempted killing of a live unborn child in a manner that is not an abortion shall be punished as provided in Title 76, Chapter 5, Part 2, Criminal Homicide.&quot; The <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14636663">legislation is in response</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Salt Lake Tribune</span> report] to a case last year where a 17-year-old girl paid a man $150 to beat her in order to induce a miscarriage. The judge in that case held that no law existed that would allow her to be charged with a crime. Also Monday, the governor vetoed the more controversial original version of the bill, <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2010/bills/hbillenr/hb0012.pdf">HB 12</a> [text, PDF], because it allowed for charges when the behavior was &quot;reckless.&quot;  Legislators feared that this language would allow for unintended consequences, that women of accidental or natural miscarriages might be investigated.<br /><br />Controversy over abortion laws has also continued in other states. Last week, the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion violates the state constitution. In February, Oklahoma state court judge Daniel Owens <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/oklahoma-judge-strikes-down-multi-part.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a different <a href="http://www.sos.state.ok.us/documents/Legislation/52nd/2009/1R/HB/1595.pdf">state law</a> [HB 1595, PDF], making it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion based on the gender of a fetus and requiring numerous reporting requirements, also violated the state constitution&#39;s single subject requirement. In November, an <a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.net/">Illinois Cook County Circuit Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/illinois-court-again-delays-enforcement.php">granted a temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] on the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2103&ChapAct=750%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A070/&ChapterID=59&ChapterName=FAMILIES&ActName=Parental%20Notice%20of%20Abortion%20Act%20of%201995">Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995</a> [text] only hours after the Illinois Medical Disciplinary Board had ruled to begin enforcing the law. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-strikes-down-abortion.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/">City of Pittsburgh</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/city_clerk/assets/ordinances/2005/05-Ord49.pdf">ordinance</a> [text, PDF] that created a layered zone structure to prevent protesters from gathering outside abortion facilities. In June 2007, the governor of New Hampshire <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-repeal-of.php">signed a repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the state&#39;s parental notification law, which never took effect.

The <a href="http://www.esocialsciences.com/data/articles/Document12472008550.2347834.pdf">Women&#39;s Reservations Bill</a> [2008 text, PDF], introduced in the <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsweb.asp">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website], or Council of States, would <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/global/article7053250.ece">increase the number of women</a> [<em>Times</em> report] serving in the 543-seat legislature, which currently has no gender quota, from 59 to at least 181. The bill is supported by the ruling <a href="http://www.congress.org.in/index.php">Congress Party</a> [party website] and also has <a href="http://www.bjp.org/content/view/3193/394/">support</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> [party website] and the Communist parties. The bill would require a constitutional amendment, meaning it must be passed by at least a two-thirds majority. Voting was <a href="http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100309/jsp/nation/story_12194815.jsp">postponed</a> [<em>Calcutta Telegraph</em> report] until Tuesday after opposition MP&#39;s tore up the bill in protest.<br /><br />The controversial legislation was originally proposed in 1996, but has been repeatedly blocked. Last year, India elected its first woman president and first woman speaker of parliament. India currently reserves one-third of seats on local governing bodies for women, and, last year, increased the quota to 50 percent.

The trial was delayed to allow the court more time to consider the defense&#39;s motion on the admissibility of the case, filed in February. The prosecutor and the victims&#39; legal representatives will have until March 29 to submit their observations. The court will hold a status conference on April 27 to hear arguments on the defense motion. <br /><br />In December, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc787666.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] Bemba to <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. The ruling reversed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/icc-orders-conditional-release-of-congo.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] issued in August ordering Bemba&#39;s conditional release. The order for release was opposed by ICC prosecutors who <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/icc-prosecutor-argues-against-release.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the original decision. The ICC in June <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">ordered Bemba to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes allegedly committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder] from October 2002 to May 2003. Bemba was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Belgium in May 2008 after the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest for his actions in the CAR. He was indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/belgium-court-transfers-former-congo.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC in July 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-728.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-728">Bloate v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-animal.php">report</a>] that time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically excludable under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00003161----000-.html">Speedy Trial Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 3161(h)(1) text]. The court held that such time may be excluded only when a district court grants a continuance. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/07/072357P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] Taylor Bloate&#39;s conviction, ruling that time granted to file pretrial motions is automatically excludable. In reversing that decision, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote:<blockquote>This case requires us to decide the narrow question whether time granted to a party to prepare pretrial motions is automatically excludable from the Act&#39;s 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1), or whether such time may be excluded only if a court makes case-specific findings under subsection (h)(7). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). We granted certiorari and now reverse.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion. Justice Samuel Alito dissented, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer.<br /><br />The Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal defendant&#39;s trial begin within 70 days after he is charged or makes an initial appearance, whichever is later, and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met. The act excludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain enumerated events. In the time leading up to Taylor Bloate&#39;s trial, the district court granted Bloate&#39;s request for extra time to prepare pretrial motions, and the appeals court ruled that the time was automatically excludable. Monday&#39;s ruling resolves a circuit split on the issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] India&#39;s upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsweb.asp">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website], on Tuesday approved a bill to ensure that one-third of seats in parliament are reserved for women. The <a href="http://www.esocialsciences.com/data/articles/Document12472008550.2347834.pdf">Women&#39;s Reservation Bill</a> [2008 text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-lawmakers-weigh-bill-to-reserve.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] Monday, would increase the number of women serving in the 543-seat legislature, which currently has no gender quota, from 59 to at least 181. The bill was passed by a <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2010/03/10/stories/2010031050880100.htm">vote of 191-1</a> [<em>Hindu</em> report] after seven lawmakers were suspended for causing a disturbance Monday by tearing up the bill and throwing it at the chairman. The bill, which requires a constitutional amendment, will now go before the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a> [official website], the lower house of parliament, where it is expected to pass. It must then be approved by at least half the states.<br /><br />The controversial legislation was originally proposed in 1996, but has been repeatedly blocked. Last year, India elected its first woman president and first woman speaker of parliament. India currently reserves one-third of seats on local governing bodies for women, and, last year, increased the quota to 50 percent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.res.01031:">voted</a> [H Res 1031 materials] Thursday to impeach federal judge <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1917">Thomas Porteous</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website]. The case will now proceed to the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] where a two-thirds majority is required to convict Porteous of committing high crimes and misdemeanors while in office, specifically perjury and accepting bribes from lawyers. The investigation of Porteous was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-committee-approves-impeachment.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">US House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] in 2008. The committee unanimously approved a resolution creating a task force to conduct the inquiry, which was the first of a sitting federal judge in nearly 20 years.<br /><br />After an <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/news/news/PorteousOrder/REPORT%20BY%20SPECIAL%20INVESTIGATORY%20COMMITTEE.PDF">investigation</a> [report text, PDF] by a special committee, the Judicial Conference found &quot;substantial evidence&quot; that Porteous had signed false financial disclosure forms, falsified statements in a personal bankruptcy proceeding, made false representations to secure a bank loan, and violated <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC00201.html">criminal laws</a> and <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/guide/vol2/ch1.html">ethical rules</a> [texts] by soliciting and receiving &quot;cash and other things of value&quot; from lawyers in a bench trial over which he was presiding. Porteous&#39;s decision in that case, <u>In re Liljeberg enters v. Lifemark Hospitals</u>, was later <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/304/304.F3d.410.00-30645.html">partially reversed</a> [opinion text] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], which last week <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/news/news/GTP%20ORDER%20AND%20PUBLIC%20REPRIMAND.pdf">publicly reprimanded Porteous</a> [text, PDF]. The US Constitution gives the House the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/impeach/constitution.html">power to impeach</a> [academic backgrounder] &quot;all civil Officers of the United States&quot; on suspicion of &quot;high Crimes and Misdemeanors.&quot; Thirteen federal judges <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/topics_ji_bdy?OpenDocument">have been impeached</a> [FJC backgrounder], of which seven have been convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Justice <a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/ruth_bader_ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> [Oyez profile] endorsed a ban on the election of judges at the state and local level on Thursday while speaking at a conference for the <a href="http://www.nawj.org/index.asp">National Association of Women Judges</a> [official website]. Ginsburg said she supported her former colleague, retired Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sandra+day+o%27connor">Sandra Day O&#39;Connor</a> [JURIST news archive], in her <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/oconnor-urges-states-to-move-towards.php">campaign</a> [JURIST report] to urge state legislatures to move towards merit-based judicial appointments instead of direct judicial elections. Both women take issue with the fundraising aspect of judicial elections and the campaign promises that are made in order to secure funds. According to the <a href="http://www.du.edu/legalinstitute/index.html">Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System</a> (IAALS) [advocacy website] there are 33 states that select judges through direct elections. Ginsburg noted in her speech that she dissented from a 2002 decision which stated that no limits could be put on the issues and topics discussed by judicial candidates. She claims that the First Amendment allows &quot;sensible limits&quot; to be put on candidates to ensure the impartiality the distinguishes a judicial office from a political office. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.du.edu/legalinstitute/judicial_selection.html">O&#39;Connor Judicial Selection Initiative</a> (OJSI) [advocacy website] came in response to a June 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-rules-iraq-sovereign.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court that <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/">West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/benjamin.htm">Justice Brent Benjamin</a> [official profile] violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights of a civil plaintiff when he did not recuse himself from a case where the defendant was one of his major campaign contributors. The OJSI is urging legislatures to adopt a system similar to one O&#39;Connor helped to introduce in Arizona, where a state commission made up mostly of non-lawyers pick judges, governors appoint judges selected by the commissions, and voters decide in future elections whether the judges stay in office. Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/T/SupremeCourt/SupremeCourtJustices/JusticeMcCaffery.htm">Seamus McCaffery</a> [official profile] has called the appointment system elitist and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/12/15/judicial.elections/index.html">says</a> [CNN report] that elections make him accountable to the citizens of Pennsylvania, rather than the governor or a commission.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cambodia.gov.kh/unisql2/egov/english/organ.assembly.html">Cambodian parliament</a> [official website] passed a controversial anti-corruption bill Wednesday meant to further transparency in government while opposition parties staged a walkout, saying the new law would stifle criticism and foster corruption. The law will create a national anti-corruption council to oversee investigators, but critics have said that the lack of independence from the government is troubling. Members of the opposition <a href="http://www.samrainsyparty.org/">Sam Rainsy Party</a> (SRP) [party website] and foreign NGOs <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010031033346/National-news/ngos-call-graft-proposal-flawed.html">criticized</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> report] the law because it could potentially punish whistle blowers with prison terms, and does not require government officials and their spouses to disclose their assets. The <a href="http://www.un.org.kh/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=44&Itemid=77">UN mission in Cambodia</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.un.org.kh/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=208:un-encourages-effective-parliamentarian-and-public-discussion-of-the-draft-anti-corruption-law-and-any-future-law-as-a-normal-part-of-any-legislative-and-democratic-process&catid=44:un-speeches-and-statements&Itemid=77">statement</a> [text] tentatively supporting the bill but calling on the government to allow more time for public debate.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> (TI) [advocacy website] has criticized Cambodian corruption, and the country is <a href="http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table">ranked</a> [TI corruption index] near the top of the list of most corrupt countries in the world. Last year, the UN cut off funding for the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> [official website], a court set up to prosecute Khmer Rouge officials, after it was accused of <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cambodia-war-crimes-court-unable-to-pay.php">corruption</a> [JURIST report] through a kick-back scheme. The UN and Cambodian officials later failed to reach an agreement on a system to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/un-cambodia-officials-fail-to-agree-on.php">monitor corruption</a> [JURIST report] and the court had to rely on <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/japan-donating-4-million-to-underfunded.php">international donations</a> [JURIST report] to make up for the shortfall.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of delegates from the <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=prosecutor">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/5A6A34A6-487C-46A0-9AEC-B646D25E4111.htm">concluded a meeting</a> [press release] in Moscow Wednesday over Russian claims of war crimes committed by Georgia during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">South Ossetia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">news archive</a>] in August 2008. The meeting, which was not attended by chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], was held at the invitation of the Russian Federation and was based on Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-reviewing-georgia.php">announcement</a> [JURIST report] of a preliminary investigation at the time of the conflict. Officials from the OTP meet with members of the Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>, the <a href="http://www.mil.ru/">Ministry of Defense</a>, the <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Office of the Prosecutor General</a>, and <a href="http://www.sledcomproc.ru/">Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation</a> [official websites, in Russian], where the OTP was presented with the progress of Russia&#39;s national judicial proceedings related to the alleged war crimes. Moreno-Ocampo expressed his full support for honest proceedings on the allegations, and said his office has &quot;offered to support in every possible way efforts by the Russian judiciary to do justice for all victims of these crimes.&quot; A similar visit to Georgia is to take place later this year.<br /><br />The South Ossetia conflict lasted for five days in August 2008 when Georgia tried to take control of its breakaway region, and Russian troops defended the region, entering Georgia. According to a  <a href="http://www.ceiig.ch/Report.html">report</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/georgia-south-ossetia-offensive.php">report</a>] released by the <a href="http://www.ceiig.ch/Index.html">Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia</a> (IIFFMCG) [official website] in October, Georgia violated international law when it shelled the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali in August 2008. The IIFFMCG also found that military action against Russian forces was not justified because the commission could not substantiate Georgian claims of a large-scale Russian military presence in the region prior to the Georgian offensive. In August, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] proposed a bill in response to the conflict that would allow the Russian army to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/russia-president-proposes-bill-to.php">intervene beyond its borders</a> [JURIST report] to protect Russian citizens abroad. In February 2008, the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">released its annual country reports on human rights</a> [JURIST report], accusing both <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119101.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119080.htm">Georgia</a> [text] of violations during the conflict. <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-presents-argument-against.php">Georgia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">Russia</a> [JURIST reports] are currently exchanging allegations of war crimes in the ICC and the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website].

Of the 349 assembly members, 88 were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g220vjRf5SSVm5PTU7W4wjC2dUIgD9ECK6B81">absent</a> [AP report]. The resolution was opposed by the ruling center-right coalition and supported by the opposition left. It passed when several members of the ruling party sided with the opposition. The Turkish government has condemned the resolution, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62A4ZX20100311">recalling its ambassador to Sweden</a> [Reuters report].<br /><br />The vote comes only a week after the US House of Representatives <a href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/">Committee on Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">voted 23-22 to adopt</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [H Res 252 text] labeling the killings as genocide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iranian court on Tuesday began the trial of 12 Iranian prison officials accused of torturing three prisoners to death, according to the state-run <a href="http://www.irna.ir/">Islamic Republic News Agency</a> (IRNA) [official website, in Persian]. The three victims, identified as Mohsen Rouholamini, Mohammad Kamrani, and Amir Javadifar, were arrested for their involvement in the protests following the June 12 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. The names of the defendants are unknown because the presiding judge has <a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=215709">prevented</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Tehran Times</span> report] any trial information from being disclosed. The 12 Kahrizak prison officials were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-prison-officials-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with murder in December. The Iranian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iran-official-acknowledges-torture-of.php">acknowledged</a> [JURIST report] in August that the detainees had been tortured, yet initially claimed that the three men had died from meningitis.<br /><br />Observers have accused the Iranian government of conducting the trial as a mere political move. In January, an Iranian parliamentary inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-parliamentary-inquiry-finds.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi was responsible for the deaths. The report alleged that Mortazavi, the prosecutor responsible for overseeing the Kahrizak prison, ordered that the prisoners be transferred to Kahrizak, where they were tortured and beaten to death. Last month, the US government and EU issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/eu-us-condemn-iran-human-rights.php">joint statement</a> [JURIST report] condemning the human rights violations following the presidential election. In December, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">labeled</a> [JURIST report] the human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election among the worst of the past 20 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] on Thursday released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials]. <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1857622883?bctid=71407042001">Announcing the release</a> [video; statement <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/03/138241.htm">text</a>], Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the US has recommitted &quot;to continue the hard work of making human rights a human reality.&quot; In its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/frontmatter/135936.htm">introduction</a> [text] to the reports, which covered 194 countries, the DOS noted that human rights violations have continued throughout the world, noting several global trends:<blockquote>In 2009, governments across the globe continued to commit serious violations of human rights. As we survey the world, there still are an alarming number of reports of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other violations of universal human rights. Often these violations relating to the integrity of the person are in countries where conflicts are occurring. These violent attacks are a central concern wherever they take place.<br /><br />In a significant number of countries, governments have imposed new and often draconian restrictions on NGOs. Since 2008, no fewer than 25 governments have imposed new restrictions on the ability of these organizations to register, to operate freely, or to receive foreign funding, adversely impacting freedom of association. In many countries, human rights defenders are singled out for particularly harsh treatment, and in the most egregious cases, they are imprisoned or even attacked or killed in reaction to their advocacy.<br /><br />These restrictions and repressive measures are part of a larger pattern of governmental efforts to control dissenting or critical voices. This pattern also extends to the media and to new forms of electronic communications through the Internet and other new technologies. Restrictions on freedom of expression, including on members of the media, are increasing and becoming more severe. In many cases, such restrictions are applied subtly by autocrats aiming to avoid attention from human rights groups and donor countries, such as through the threat of criminal penalties and administrative or economic obstacles, rather than through violence or imprisonment; the end result is still a chilling effect on freedom of expression.<br /><br />A third trend we observed is the continuing and escalating discrimination and persecution of members of vulnerable groups &#8211; often racial, religious, or ethnic minorities, but also women, members of indigenous communities, children, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups that lack the political power in their societies to defend their own interests.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/index.htm">Africa</a> [materials], the DOS criticized continuing conflicts in the <a href="/countries/congo.php">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> and <a href="/countries/sudan.php">Sudan</a>. It also criticized <a href="/countries/uganda.php">Uganda</a> for its treatment of homosexuals and <a href="/countries/nigeria.php">Nigeria</a> [JURIST news archives] for extrajudicial killings.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eap/index.htm">East Asia and the Pacific</a> [materials], the DOS criticized <a href="/countries/china.php">China</a> for its increased Internet censorship and <a href="/countries/myanmar.php">Myanmar</a> for attacks on ethnic minorities. The DOS also criticized <a href="/countries/northkorea.php">North Korea</a> for denying citizens freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vietnam">Vietnam</a> [JURIST news archives] for suppressing dissent.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/index.htm">Europe and Eurasia</a> [materials], the DOS said that the situation in the North Caucasus region of <a href="/countries/russia.php">Russia</a> has worsened. The DOS also criticized <a href="/countries/belarus.php">Belarus</a> for restrictions on civil liberties and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=switzerland">Switzerland</a> for passing a constitutional amendment banning the construction of minarets. The Department noted an increase in the killings of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma</a> people in <a href="/countries/italy.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=romania">Romania</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=slovakia">Slovakia</a>, and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=czech+republic">Czech Republic</a> [JURIST news archives].<br /><br />In the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/index.htm">Near East and North Africa</a>, the DOS criticized <a href="/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> for failing to respect the freedom of association and the freedom of religion and <a href="/countries/saudi.php">Saudi Arabia</a> for violence against women. The DOS also criticized <a href="/countries/iran.php">Iran</a> for human rights violations following the disputed presidential election last June, <a href="/countries/israel.php">Israel</a> for violations during last year&#39;s Operation Cast Lead, and <a href="/countries/iraq.php">Iraq</a> [JURIST news archives] for ongoing rights abuses.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/sca/index.htm">South and Central Asia</a> [materials], the DOS said human rights had deteriorated in <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> because of increased insurgent attacks. The Department said that civilian authorities had taken positive steps in <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a>, but that significant challenges remain. The DOS criticized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for using excessive force before the end of the conflict with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ltte">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) last May and <a href="/countries/uzbekistan.php">Uzbekistan</a> [JURIST news archives] for restricting freedom of the press.<br /><br />In the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/wha/index.htm">Western Hemisphere</a> [materials], the DOS praised <a href="/countries/colombia.php">Colombia</a> for an active independent media, but warned of intimidation by members of illegal armed groups. The DOS criticized <a href="/countries/cuba.php">Cuba</a> for interfering with the right to privacy and <a href="/countries/venezuela.php">Venezuela</a> [JURIST news archives] for attacking private media owners.<br /><br />The DOS issues its yearly reports on human rights practices to Congress under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode22/usc_sec_22_00002151---n000-.html">legal mandate</a> [22 USC &sect; 2151n text], and has filed similar reports for <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">2008</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">2007</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rice-says-us-allies-among-worst-human.php">2006</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/us-rights-reports-name-north-korea.php">2005</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/state-department-raps-middle-east.php">2004</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/us-human-rights-reports-cite-gains-in.htm">2003</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/state-department-human-rights-reports.php">2002</a> [JURIST reports] and previous years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://legis.state.va.us/">Virginia General Assembly</a> [official website] on Wednesday passed a <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB10S1+pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that will ban any federal mandate for individuals to have health insurance. The bill, called the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/10/AR2010031003908.html">first of its kind</a> [WP report] passed by any state, and says that no individual shall be held liable if they refuse to sign up for health care. Governor <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Robert McDonnell</a> [official website] has said that he will <a href="http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-va-lawmakers-say-no-to-health-care,0,575310.story">sign</a> [WTVR report] the bill into law. About 30 other states are working on a similar measure to <a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=ALEC_s_Freedom_of_Choice_in_Health_Care_Act">negate</a> [ALEC report] the widely expected federal mandate for health insurance. <br /><br />Last month, President Barack Obama released his own <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-unveils-proposal-to-reconcile.php">health care proposal</a> [JURIST report] that seeks to reconcile versions of the bill passed by the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/house-passes-landmark-health-care.php">House</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] last year. In December, 13 state attorney generals <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/gop-state-ags-threaten-legal-action.php">threatened to sue</a> [JURIST report] unless a provision in the Senate bill exempting Nebraska from much of its health care costs was removed. Obama has argued that the legislation would overhaul private health insurance and provide affordable care for millions of Americans while Republicans have said they would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/health/policy/25health.html?_r=1&hp">block the bill</a> [NYT report] because it was too expensive and would compel people to buy health insurance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar&#39;s military junta announced the implementation of another election law on Wednesday that establishes procedures for the country&#39;s first election in 20 years. The Political Parties Registration Law <a href="http://www.myanmarnews.net/story/610535">prevents</a> [IANS report] political prisoners from participating in the election and also makes it illegal for members of religious orders, insurgent groups, and foreigners to join political parties. The most notable ramification of the new law is that it would prevent pro-democracy opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] from participating in the election unless she is released from prison. The new law would also prevent Suu Kyi from remaining as the head of the <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website] if the party wishes to participate in the election. The NLD has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYm5aNyYP5Jptb530N8Rs_pAiEiQ">not committed</a> [AFP report] to taking part in the polls, claiming that the 2008 constitution is unfair because it bans Suu Kyi from taking part in the polls and reserves a quarter of parliamentary seats for the military. An election date has not been set.<br /><br />The Political Parties Registration Law is one of the five laws being enacted by the military junta in anticipation of the election. On Tuesday, the junta <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-election-laws.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] the Union Election Commission Law, which states that the military government will appoint a five-member commission that will supervise and have the final say on all electoral matters. In February, UN High Representative for Human Rights <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-court-sentences-monk-to-7-years.php">expressed great disappointment</a> [JURIST report] during his visit to Myanmar, stating that without certain action the elections &quot;will not be credible.&quot; Also in February, Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-high-court-rejects-suu-kyi.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the latest appeal by Suu Kyi against the extension of her house arrest. Suu Kyi, who has been in prison or under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-official-says-suu-kyi-to-be.php">released in November</a> [JURIST report] according to a government official, likely after the elections have taken place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An international group of human rights lawyers on Tuesday <a href="/pdf/UNWGADpetition.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; <a href="/pdf/UNWGADrelease.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] to condemn to the detention of Chinese human rights lawyer <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gao+Zhisheng">news archive</a>], missing for more than a year. The group is seeking a declaration that Gao&#39;s detention is a violation of international law. According to the petition, Gao&#39;s detention violates both the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [texts]:<br /><blockquote><br />Mr. Gao&#39;s current predicament is merely the culmination of a pattern and practice by which the Chinese government has consistently and clearly violated Article 19 of both the Universal Declaration and the ICCPR. Without an arrest warrant to attest otherwise, we can only assume that Mr. Gao&#39;s current detention is related to his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government&#39;s human rights record relating to religious freedom. Detaining Mr. Gao as punishment for or to prevent his defense of persecuted religious groups is a violation of Article 19(2).<br /></blockquote><br />The group also clams that Gao&#39;s detention violates Chinese law.<br /><br />Last month, human rights organization <a href="http://www.duihua.org/">Dui Hua Foundation</a> [advocacy website] reported that the <a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/">Chinese Embassy</a> [official website] in Washington DC claims that Gao is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-embassy-claims-missing-rights.php">working in the Urumqi region</a> [JURIST report] of China. Chinese <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/fyrmcxjl/">Ma Zhaoxu</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-official-says-missing-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in late January that Gao is &quot;where he should be.&quot; Earlier in January, Chinese lawyers and US-based rights group <a href="http://www.chinaaid.org/qry/page.taf">ChinaAid</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-activists-demand-search-for.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Beijing police to conduct a search for Gao. Gao has been detained since February 4, 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Italian <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] on Wednesday gave final approval to a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">bill</a> [materials, in Italian] that would allow cabinet ministers, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>], to postpone criminal proceedings against them on the grounds that they would interfere with official duties. The legislation, passed by a vote of <a href="http://www.corriere.it/politica/10_marzo_10/legittimo_impedimento_fiducia_18908758-2c15-11df-b239-00144f02aabe.shtml">169-126</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</font> report, in Italian] with three members abstaining, will allow officials to suspend trials against them for up to 18 months by claiming a &quot;legitimate impediment&quot; to appearing in court. Critics contend that the legislation is specifically designed to protect Berlusconi from the prosecutions he faces, while supporters claim that it will modernize the country&#39;s judicial system and allow elected officials to perform their duties.<br /><br />The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-lower-house-approves-bill-that.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] last month. In January, hundreds of Italy&#39;s judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. That bill was also criticized as being tailored for Berlusiconi&#39;s benefit and would result in the automatic dismissal of two pending cases against him. Later that month, it was reported that Berlusconi could also face a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-pm-berlusconi-may-face-third.php">third trial</a> based on information that surfaced recently. Berlusconi currently faces a corruption trial and a tax fraud trial, both of which have been postponed. The leader has been previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a>, and has had other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government responded on Friday to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of a US human rights report critical of China by issuing its <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/world/2010-03/12/content_19596239.htm">own report</a>  [text] criticizing the US human rights record. The report covered issues relating to crime, racial discrimination, and poverty, and accused the US of using its hegemonic power to continue &quot;trampling&quot; on the sovereignty of other countries while &quot;posing as the world judge of human rights&quot;:<blockquote>For a long time, [the US] has placed itself above other countries, considered itself &quot;world human rights police&quot; and ignored its own serious human rights problems. It releases Country Reports on Human Rights Practices year after year to accuse other countries and takes human rights as a political instrument to interfere in other countries&#39; internal affairs, defame other nations&#39; image and seek its own strategic interests. This fully exposes its double standards on the human rights issue, and has inevitably drawn resolute opposition and strong denouncement from world people. At a time when the world is suffering a serious human rights disaster caused by the US subprime crisis-induced global financial crisis, the US government still ignores its own serious human rights problems but revels in accusing other countries. It is really a pity.</blockquote> While the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jzzULJt2ZiW2IZR3KKuViEpbOAlQD9ED1QQ04">US report</a> [AP report] is drawn largely from the work of rights groups and American diplomats, China&#39;s response mainly cited US media reports as evidence of its claims, along with data from non-governmental organizations and federal and state governments.<br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-urges-us-to-reflect-on-own-issues.php">annual dueling</a> [JURIST report] between the US and China on human rights has lasted over a decade. In 2008 the Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/china-official-denounces-us-human.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government of denying its citizens basic human rights while also urging judicial reform and improved governmental transparency. Special mention was made of violence in Tibet.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/05-17257.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that a teacher-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools does not violate the constitution. Sacramento atheist <a href="/currentawareness/newdow.php">Michael Newdow</a> [JURIST news archive] had challenged the practice on behalf of several families, arguing that the phrase &quot;under God&quot; violated the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. In reversing a <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/breaking-news-federal-judge-rules.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] that had ruled in Newdow&#39;s favor, the appeals court ruled 2-1:<blockquote>that the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the Establishment Clause because Congress&#39; ostensible and predominant purpose was to inspire patriotism and that the context of the Pledge - its wording as a whole, the preamble to the statute, and this nation&#39;s history&#8212;demonstrate that it is a predominantly patriotic exercise. For these reasons, the phrase &quot;one Nation under God&quot; does not turn this patriotic exercise into a religious activity.<br /><br />Accordingly, we hold that California&#39;s statute requiring school districts to begin the school day with an &quot;appropriate patriotic exercise&quot; does not violate the Establishment Clause even though it permits teachers to lead students in recitation<br />of the Pledge.</blockquote>In a separate case decided Thursday, the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/06-16344.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the use of the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on currency. That challenge was also brought by Newdow.<br /><br />Newdow originally sued to have the phrase &quot;under God&quot; removed from the pledge in 2000. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Newdow&#39;s favor in 2002, but the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-dismisses.htm">dismissed his case</a> [JURIST report] in 2004 for lack of standing. Newdow also <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/suit-to-bar-prayer-at-presidential.php">filed suit</a> to ban the recitation of a prayer during the 2005 presidential inauguration, but that claim was <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-rejects.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4459">hearing</a> [materials; <a href="http://www.senate.gov/fplayers/CommPlayer/commFlashPlayer.cfm?fn=judiciary031010&st=xxx">video</a>] Wednesday on the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">eased restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on political campaign spending by corporations. The hearing, entitled &quot;We the People? Corporate Spending in American Elections after Citizens United,&quot; did not focus on any specific bill, but rather on general <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-lawmakers-propose-legislation-to.php">legislative efforts</a> [JURIST report] to limit the ruling&#39;s effects. Committee chair <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=4459&wit_id=2629">said</a> [testimony] that the &quot;Citizens United decision turns the idea of Government of, by and for the people on its head.&quot; Witness <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/10-03-10Smith%27sTestimony.pdf">Bradley Smith</a>, law professor and chairman of the <a href="http://www.campaignfreedom.org/">Center for Competitive Politics</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/10-03-10Smith%27sTestimony.pdf">countered</a> [testimony, PDF] that &quot;the Court&#39;s decision in Citizens United is one of the most clearly correct decisions of the Court&#39;s term,&quot; and that &quot;Congress need not &#39;fix&#39; this sound decision.&quot;<br /><br />In January, the US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to ease restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations. The court was asked to consider Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. President Barack Obama sharply <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the decision in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union Address</a> [transcript] in January. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. The decision has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/21/campaign.finance.ruling/index.html?iref=allsearch">caused a deep partisan divide</a> [CNN report] over the topic, with Democratic officials largely opposing the decision, and Republican officials mostly in support.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigerian police officials said Wednesday that 49 people, predominately Muslims, will be charged with murder following the recent killing of Christian villagers near the city of Jos. Reports have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8560671.stm">varied</a> [BBC report] as to the number of people killed in the weekend attack, but police now put the number at 109. The attacks were apparently in <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNCU46VYMVf0VzhqkKJUus45PrDAD9EAMDH84">retaliation</a> [AP report] for the January violence between Muslims and Christians which left more than 300, mostly Muslims, dead. The city of Jos is located in an area of central Nigeria, which divides the predominately Muslim northern part of the country from the primarily Christian south. Authorities have indicated that the area is being patrolled by security forces to prevent further violence. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on the Nigerian government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/nigeria-urged-to-prosecute-those.php">prosecute those responsible</a> [JURIST report] for the violence. <br /><br />Last month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/rights-group-urges-nigeria-acting.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] acting President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8510390.stm">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] to to &quot;tackle the culture of impunity&quot; in Nigeria. While HRW has called on Jonathan directly, other rights groups have petitioned international authorities to take action to prevent recurring rights abuses. Earlier in February, the <a href="http://www.serap-nigeria.org/">Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project</a> (SERAP) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-rights-group-urges-icc-to.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] investigation into the violence that took place in Jos in January. The ICC is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-considering-investigation-into.php">considering</a> [JURIST report] the petition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Afghan government should <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/10/afghanistan-repeal-amnesty-law">retract a law granting amnesty</a> [press release] for war crimes and human rights abuses committed prior to December 2001, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Wednesday. The National Stability and Reconciliation Law was originally passed by the Afghan <a href="http://www.parliament.af/">Parliament</a> [official website] in 2007, but did not take effect until it was recently published in the official gazette. HRW claims that the law protects alleged war criminals and human rights abusers, many of whom remain in positions of power within the government. The group says the law will also grant future immunity to people involved in current fighting in Afghanistan if they agree to reconciliation with the government. Supporters of the law note that criminal claims may still be brought by individuals, but HRW disputes this claim saying the court system is &quot;barely functioning in much of the country, corruption is rampant, and there is no witness protection system.&quot; Afghan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/sroot_eng.aspx?id=166">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>] had previously indicated he would <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-46804820100310?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">not sign</a> [Reuters report] the act into law. <br /><br />In 2007, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/afghanistan-president-signs-war-crimes.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] granting amnesty to groups that allegedly committed war crimes. The 2007 resolution barred the state from independently prosecuting individuals for war crimes absent accusation from an alleged victim. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/afghanistan-upper-house-approves-war.php">previous version</a> of the same bill <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/protesters-rally-for-afghanistan-war.php">drew popular support</a> [JURIST reports], but Karzai refused to sign the bill in the original form.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sgsm12783.doc.htm">said</a> [press release] Wednesday that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-election-laws.php">recently announced election laws</a> [JURIST report]  in <a href="/countries/myanmar.php">Myanmar</a> [JURIST news archive] do not meet international standards for an inclusive political process, in particular because they do not allow pro-democracy opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] to participate. Ban&#39;s statement was issued the same day the ruling military junta <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] the Political Parties Registration Law, which prevents political prisoners from participating in the election and also makes it illegal for members of religious orders, insurgent groups, and foreigners to join political parties. Ban called on the Myanmar leaders to ensure that country&#39;s first election in 20 years is &quot;fair, transparent and credible&quot; and allows all of Myanmar&#39;s citizen&#39;s to be involved. The election law also drew criticism from the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/10/burma-election-laws-may-shut-down-opposition-parties">said</a> [press release] &quot;[the new law] continues the sham political process that is aimed at creating the appearance of civilian rule with a military spine.&quot; Additionally, on Thursday the military junta <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/313579,myanmar-junta-appoints-election-commission--summary.html">nominated</a> [DPA report] a 17-member commission to supervise the elections and invalidated the 1990 election, which brought Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website] to power.  <br /><br />On Monday, the military junta <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/2010394417778884.html">enacted</a> [Al Jazeera report] five laws to govern the upcoming election and has been publicly announcing them one at a time in state-run newspapers. One of the most notable ramifications of the new laws is that Suu Kyi will be prevented from participating in the election unless she is released from prison. The new law would also prevent Suu Kyi from remaining as the head of the NLD if the party wishes to participate in the election. The NLD has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iYm5aNyYP5Jptb530N8Rs_pAiEiQ">not committed</a> [AFP report] to taking part in the polls, claiming that the 2008 constitution is unfair because it bans Suu Kyi from taking part in the polls and reserves a quarter of parliamentary seats for the military. Suu Kyi, speaking through her lawyer, on Thursday <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5icOLiWSd_QnKWNG9vA6qpOlsluuQ">called on</a> [AFP report] the Myanmar people to give a unified response to what she called the unjust election law.

		<title>Senate Judiciary Committee approves bill reducing cocaine sentencing disparities</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">US Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] Thursday unanimously approved a <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s1789/text">bill</a> [bill; S. 1789] to reduce sentencing disparities for powder and crack cocaine offenses.  The Fair Sentencing Act, introduced by <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/person.xpd?id=300038">Senator Dick Durbin</a> [D-IL; official profile], is intended to bridge the gap between crack and powder cocaine sentencing by amending the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">Controlled Substances Act</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148751.htm">Controlled Substances Import and Export Act</a> [text].  The Act directs the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] to review its trafficking guidelines to reflect aggravating factors such as the use of a weapon or commission of violence.  It would increase the amount of crack cocaine required for imposition of a mandatory trafficking prison term and eliminate the five year mandatory prison sentence for simple possession of crack.<br /><br />Last July, the US <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-passes-bill-to.php">similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would eliminate the distinction between crack cocaine and powder cocaine under federal law. Crack cocaine sentencing policies have raised controversy by virtue of their disparate impact on African American offenders. Last June, US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2009/ag-speech-0906242.html">urged sentencing reform</a> [transcript text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ag-holder-urges-cocaine-sentencing.php">report</a>] for crack cocaine, calling for a review of disparities between sentencing guidelines for powder and crack. In April, other DOJ officials said Congress should <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-urges-end-to-cocaine-sentencing.php">eliminate the sentencing disparities</a> [JURIST report] between crimes committed involving crack and powder cocaine during a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3798">hearing</a> [materials] of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/about/subcommittees/crime.cfm">Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs</a> [official website]. In April 2008, a study by the USSC <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/USSC_Crack_Cocaine_Retroactivity_Data_Report_21_April_08.pdf">reported</a> [study, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">report</a>] that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses have had their sentences reduced under an amendment to sentencing guidelines. In 2007, the USSC <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/PRESS/rel121107.htm">reduced crack cocaine penalties</a> [press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, <a href="http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Minister_Ahern's_CV">Dermot Ahern</a> [official profile], on Sunday <a href="http://www.atheist.ie/2010/03/ahern-proposes-referendum-on-blasphemy-this-autumn/">proposed</a> [Atheist Ireland press release] holding a referendum later this year to remove the criminal offense of blasphemy from the <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland.pdf">Irish Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Blasphemy is a punishable offense under section 40 of the constitution, but the language of the text had been deemed too vague to hold any prosecutions. Ireland&#39;s <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0031/index.html">Defamation Act of 2009</a> [text], which went into effect in January, redefined blasphemy as publishing or uttering &quot;matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion&quot; and imposed a penalty of a fine of up to 25,000 euros for those convicted. The Irish public has been <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0104/1224261600743.html">very critical</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Irish Times</span> report] of the controversial law. Earlier this year, advocacy group <a href="http://www.atheist.ie/">Atheist Ireland</a> [advocacy website] publicly challenged the law on their website by posting <a href="http://www.atheist.ie/2010/01/25-blasphemous-quotations/">25 potentially blasphemous statements</a> [text] from both religious and public figures. The group praised Ahern&#39;s proposed referendum:<br /><blockquote><br />We reiterate our position that this law is both silly and dangerous: silly because it is introducing medieval canon law offence into a modern plularist republic; and dangerous because it incentives religious outrage and because its wording has already been adopted by Islamic States as part of their campaign to make blasphemy a crime internationally.<br /></blockquote><br />Ahern has stated that he only saw the Defamation Act as a short-term solution and that he was under his constitutional duty in reforming the old blasphemy law. <br /><br />Blasphemy laws have been a controversial issue in several countries. Last month, a Pakistani government official told the Agence France-Presse that the country would begin to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-to-revise-blasphemy-laws.php">revise its blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST report] later this year. Pakistan currently punishes blasphemy against Islam by death, but no one has yet been executed for the offense. Last year, the death sentence of Afghan journalism student <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kambaksh">Sayad Parwaz Kambaksh</a> [JURIST news archive] for blasphemy was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/afghan-journalism-student-death.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years&#39; imprisonment by an Afghan appeals court. Kambaksh was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/afghan-journalism-student-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] for distributing papers questioning gender roles under Islam. In 2008, the UK House of Lords <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php">voted to abolish</a> [JURIST report] the criminal offenses of blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the UK common law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vietnamese authorities on Monday released a Catholic priest and leading rights activist from Hanoi prison. <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/father.php">Father Nguyen Van Ly</a> [Freedom Now profile] was released early Monday morning and has been reunited with his family in Hue. Ly had been arrested and charged in 2007 under <a href="http://www.worldlii.org/vn/legis/pc66/s88.html">Article 88 of Vietnam&#39;s Penal Code</a> [text], which provides for the incarceration of individuals involved in &quot;conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.&quot; Ly was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/vietnam-priest-sentenced-to-eight-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to eight years&#39; imprisonment for distributing anti-government documents and communicating with foreign pro-democracy activists. He suffered <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA41/009/2009/en/0dee75c8-9d34-4cba-84fa-c969483f351f/asa410092009en.html">two strokes</a> [AI press release] in 2009 that left him partially paralyzed. Calls for Ly&#39;s release included a June 2009 <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/LettertoVietnamesePresidentTrietonFatherLy.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] from 37 US senators addressed to President Nguyen Minh Triet. Ly is known as one of the founders of Vietnamese pro-democracy movement Bloc 8406. Ly&#39;s international counsel <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/home.php">Freedom Now</a> [advocacy website] has praised him as a <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressRelease-FatherNguyenVanLyReleasedfromPrison.pdf">&quot;prisoner of conscience&quot;</a> [press release, PDF].<br /><br />Ly&#39;s release comes days after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/vietnam-human-rights-lawyer-released.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of leading Vietnamese rights lawyer <a href="a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/individuals-at-risk/write-for-rights/tw-hrds"">Le Thi Cong Nhan</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thi+Cong+Nhan+">news archive</a>]. No clear connection has been identified between the two incidents, but the releases happen in the midst of what some rights groups such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/02/04/vietnam-expanding-campaign-silence-dissent">termed</a> [press release] a &quot;campaign to silence dissent.&quot; At least 16 activists have been jailed in the last few months. Despite the releases of Ly and Nhan, other high-profile activists, such as human rights lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/vietnam-rights-lawyers-arrested-after.php">Nguyen Van Dai</a> [JURIST report], are still serving sentences.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt&#39;s <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/LastPage.aspx?Category_ID=250">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official backgrounder] ruled Sunday that female judges can serve on the State Council (Maglis id-Dowla), an administrative court system with jurisdiction over cases involving the state. In its ruling, the court <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkKGunkBwAkcRJJQC5duIuQjE3cwD9EF16MG2">emphasized the equality of all citizens</a> [AP report]. Last month, the general assembly of the State Council <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/egypt-state-court-system-bars-female.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to bar the appointment of female judges to the court. The council&#39;s supervisory committee later overruled that bar, which led <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/Cabinet/Prime_Minister.aspx">Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif</a> [official profile] to ask the Supreme Court to rule on the issue. Sunday&#39;s ruling stated that the general assembly did not have the authority to determine who can serve on the court and that only the supervisory committee can approve new judges. The supervisory committee is expected to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g5zbVpbsm8eqNS7G7AQ5uFCQ5fkQ">review the issue</a> [AFP report] later this month. <br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/02/23/egypt-open-all-judicial-positions-women">condemned</a> [press release] the general assembly&#39;s vote and argued that all judicial positions should be open to women. In 2007, 31 Egyptian women were <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/egypt-appoints-31-female-judges-despite.php">selected</a> [JURIST report] as judges by Egypt&#39;s Supreme Judicial Council, and later appointed by presidential decree despite ongoing resistance from the nation&#39;s conservatives. Council chief Mukbil Shakir selected the judges from a pool of state prosecutors who had passed a test for the positions. The move marked the first time in Egypt&#39;s history that women were named to preside over criminal or civil cases. In 2003, Tahany el-Gebaly became the nation&#39;s <a href="http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/030129/2003012926.html">first female judge</a> [<em>Arabic News</em> report] as a member of the Egyptian constitutional tribunal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea <a href="http://www0.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [official profile] said Monday that the North Korean human rights situation is continuing to deteriorate. Presenting his <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A.HRC.13.13_En.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], Muntarbhorn noted that any attempt to halt human rights violations in North Korea would require <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> (SC) [official website] action. The rapporteur also said he has not been admitted to North Korea and has thus relied on reports from UN agencies, concerned rights groups, and refugees in making his assessment. Muntarbhorn also stated that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/12/un-north-korea-nuclear-sanctions">sanctions</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] imposed on North Korea in an effort to promote denuclearization have fallen short of improving the country&#39;s human rights situation. North Korean diplomat Choe Myong Nam <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/press/hrc/index.htm">rejected</a> [press release] the special rapporteur&#39;s allegations.<br /><br />In October, Muntarbhorn <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for human rights violations. Muntarbhorn said that North Korea was responsible for a broad range of <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/press/hrc/index.htm">human rights violations</a> [UN press release], including torture, public executions, and widespread hunger. In March 2009, Muntarbhorn told the UNHRC that he found egregious <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-investigator-cites-north.php">human  rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea. In October 2008, Muntarbhorn <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-investigator-urges-north-korea-to.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] North Korea to improve its treatment of prisoners and unsuccessful defectors, as well as to cooperate in locating kidnapped foreign citizens. In January 2008, Muntarbhorn made similar comments during his visit with a special UN envoy to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/north-korea-still-violating-human.php">Japan</a> [JURIST report] to assess the impact of the North Korean rights situation on that country. North Korea has frequently been accused of human trafficking, press repression, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/north-korea-committing-crimes-against.php">&quot;actively committing crimes against humanity&quot;</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana released a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A-HRC-13-48.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Friday criticizing the government of Myanmar for long-standing human rights abuses and said some of those might qualify as war crimes prosecutable by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Quintana observed:<blockquote>there is a pattern of gross and systematic violation of human rights which has been in place for many years and still continues. The human rights that are part of this pattern are broad ranging and include the rights to life, to liberty, to personal integrity, to freedom of expression, assembly and religion, to judicial remedy and due process of law, to nationality, to protection of civilians and internally displaced communities and to prohibition against discrimination, among others.<br /><br />Given the gross and systematic nature of human rights violations in Myanmar over a period of many years, and the lack of accountability, there is an indication that those human rights violations are the result of a State policy that involves authorities in the executive, military and judiciary at all levels. According to consistent reports, the possibility exists that some of these human rights violations may entail categories of crimes against humanity or war crimes under the terms of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</blockquote>Myanmar is expected to hold elections in October. <br /><br />Myanmar has a long history of human rights abuses. The UN released a report Thursday stating that the elections expected in October will not meet international standards of fairness. Earlier this week, the military junta <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/03/2010394417778884.html">enacted</a> [Al Jazeera report] five laws to govern the upcoming election and has been publicly announcing them one-at-a-time in state-run newspapers. One of the most notable ramifications of the new laws is that Suu Kyi will be prevented from participating in the election unless she is released from prison. The new law would also prevent Suu Kyi from remaining as the head of the NLD if the party wishes to participate in the election.

Wrapping up talks on the treaty to replace the recently expired <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START I Treaty) [materials], Obama and Medvedev reviewed the negotiations, agreed to provide additional <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hfp1miYgr5vwBIxHmR9tJklhCYhg">guidance to delegations</a> [AFP report], and discussed plans for bilateral contacts. The landmark treaty will include <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703338504575041562540396530.html">significant reductions</a> [WSJ report] in both the number of deployed nuclear weapons as well as the number of nuclear-delivery systems. Although a no time frame was given, the <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">Kremlin</a> [official website, in Russian] says the conversation opened the possibility for setting a firm date for signing. White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc">National Security Council</a> [official website] spokesperson Mike Hammer described the talks as encouraging, saying that both Obama and Medvedev are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62C1GK20100313">committed to reaching an agreement soon</a> [Reuters report]. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> is scheduled to visit Moscow on Thursday and Friday where she will discuss START with Russia <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bul_ns_en.nsf/kartaflat/en03.01">Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profiles].<br /><br />Both US and Russia officials have recently expressed a desire to have the treaty in place prior to the upcoming <a href="http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100107_2654.php">Global Nuclear Security Summit</a> [NTI backgrounder] in April, and the <a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nonproliferation/articles/120909_global_nuclear_security_summit/">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference</a> [CAC fact sheet] in May. Last month, US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/121630.htm">Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller</a> [official profile] went to Paris to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">finalize the treaty</a> [JURIST report] after Obama and Medvedev reached an in-principle agreement. In January, Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/bul_ns_en.nsf/kartaflat/en03.01">Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov</a> [official profile] said that nuclear arms reduction negotiations with the US were <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-foreign-minister-says-us-nuclear.php">likely to resume</a> [JURIST report] in early February. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">languished</a> [JURIST report] during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the former Cold War rivals, which reached their worst point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Advocacy groups, including the <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/">Arms Control Association</a> [advocacy website], support the treaty for not only limiting the number of nuclear weapons, but for also providing methods for each side to moderator the other. The US and Russia began nuclear disarmament talks last April and originally set a deadline for December, when START I expired. Last July, Obama and Medvedev <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/world/europe/07prexy.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2">agreed</a> [NYT report] to tentative terms for the treaty.

Though Taiwan has not executed a criminal since 2005, Wang said she <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8563838.stm">would not sign</a> [BBC report] the execution warrants of any of the <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1201972&lang=eng_news&cate_img=83.jpg&cate_rss=news_Politics_TAIWAN">44 prisoners</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taiwan News</span> report] still on death row. Her resignation was sparked by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62B0KE20100312">possible criticism</a> [Reuters report] of her position by the office of Taiwanese President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ma+Ying-jeou">Ma Ying-jeou</a> [JURIST news archive], a member of her own Kuomintang party. Three-fourths of Taiwanese citizens favor the death penalty. Taiwanese Premier Wu Den-yih has already <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?ID=201003120011&Type=aIPL">appointed a replacement</a> [CNA report].<br /><br />In February, UN Under-Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/ordzhonikidze_bio.asp">Sergei Ordzhonikidze</a> [official profile] praised the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-official-applauds-states-efforts-to.php">increase in the number of countries</a> [JURIST report] that have suspended or abolished the death penalty. Speaking at the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/4th-World-Congress-Against-the-Death-Penalty">4th World Congress Against the Death Penalty</a> [FIDH backgrounder] in Geneva, Ordzhonikidze expressed hope that countries that have not abolished the death penalty would adopt the 2007 <a href="http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/APROweb.nsf/pages/adpan_UNGA_62149">UN Resolution 62/149</a> [text], placing a moratorium on the use of capital punishment.

Ikonic was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/three-former-bosnian-serb-police.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to BiH in January after he was arrested on an international arrest warrant.

The nine, members of the <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php">Serbian paramilitary group</a> [B92 report] Sakali, are accused of the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100313/ap_on_re_eu/eu_serbia_war_crimes_1">systematic murders</a> [AP report] of 41 ethnic Albanians in May 1999.  In all, roughly 200 civilians residing in and around the village of Cuska are believed to have been killed by these and 15 other suspects.  Those in custody are scheduled to appear before an investigative judge.<br /><br />In June, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] marked the 10-year anniversary of the conflict&#39;s end by reporting that many human rights abuses that occurred during the war in Kosovo have gone <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-claims-kosovo-war-crimes.php">uninvestigated and unpunished</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors have nonetheless secured several convictions. A week after AI&#39;s report, a Serbian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/serbia-court-sentences-ex-paramilitary.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] four former paramilitary officers of killing 14 Albanians in northern Kosovo. In April, four Serbian ex-policemen were <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-war-crimes-court-convicts-ex.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of killing of 48 Albanian civilians in Suva Reka. In October 2008, the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/">Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website, in Bosnian] sentenced ex-policeman Vaso Todorovic to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/former-bosnian-serb-police-officer.php">six years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for the capture and detention of 40,000 Bosnian Muslims in 1995. Earlier that month, four Bosnian Serbs were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/bosnia-war-crimes-prosecutor-arrests.php">arrested for the killing of 200 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in Koricanske Stijene.

At a meeting of European foreign ministers in  northern Finland Davutoglu <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/queensland/a/-/world/6929800/sweden-turkey-jointly-denounce-genocide-vote/">questioned the rationale</a> [Reuters report] of the move, one that Bildt characterized as the &quot;politicization of history.&quot;  Davutoglu insisted that his country would not succumb to political pressure.  Both ministers noted concerns that the resolution would undermine the progress that Armenia and Turkey have made toward stabilizing their relations.<br /><br />The Swedish Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sweden-parliament-approves-armenian.php">adopted the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 131-130, prompting Turkey to <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/statement-made-by-the-office-of-the-prime-minister-of-the-republic-of-turkey.en.mfa">recall its ambassador</a> [press release] from Stockholm and cancel official events in Sweden.

The US government has indicated that it will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">seek to block the resolution</a> [JURIST report] from being put before the full House of Representatives. A <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-house-panel-approves-resolution-on.php">similar resolution was passed</a> by the committee in 2007, but it <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/turkish-pm-welcomes-delayed-vote-on-us.php">never reached the House floor</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US military on Monday transferred <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/al-taji.htm">Camp Taji</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], one of the two remaining detention facilities under US control, to Iraqi authorities. Located approximately 25 kilometers north of Baghdad, Taji currently houses about <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9EF3KM00">2,900 detainees</a> [AP report] held on arrest warrants, detention orders, or as convicted prisoners. About 100 detainees will remain in US custody. During the ceremony transferring Camp Taji, Brigadier General David Quantock, <a href="http://www.usf-iraq.com/">United States Forces-Iraq</a> [official website] deputy commanding general for detainee operations, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jPQL1RAtCU_0y0tQtUE6yZhxH6tg">praised</a> [AFP report] the Iraqi staff currently running the facility. Quantock added that <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/saddam-iap.htm">Camp Cropper</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cropper">news archive</a>], the only remaining US-run detention facility, would be transferred to Iraqi control on July 15.<br /><br />The US began to scale back its Iraq detention facilities in September when <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/umm-qasr.htm">Camp Bucca</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bucca">news archive</a>] in Southern Iraq was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-closes-controversial-camp-bucca.php">closed</a> [JURIST report] pursuant to the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF]. According to the agreement, all US troops must be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of 2011, and the US must release all prisoners or transfer them to the control of Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government must have arrest warrants or detention orders to accept transferred prisoners into Iraqi facilities, otherwise risking release. In <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/us-military-begins-work-on-iraq.php">anticipation of prisoner releases and transfers</a> [JURIST report], the US opened a new facility in February to <a href="http://www.usf-iraq.com/news/press-releases/new-training-facility-opens-for-iraqi-corrections-officers">train Iraqi corrections officers</a> [press release]. A fourth US-run prison, <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">transferred back to Iraqi control</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 following the release of photographs depicting prisoner abuse by US military personnel.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen/index.htm">National People&#39;s Congress</a> (NPC) [official website, in Chinese] on Sunday approved an amendment to the electoral law mandating equal representation for rural and urban citizens. The electoral reform was <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-03/14/c_13210668.htm">adopted</a> [Xinhua report] at the close of the <a href="http://www.npc.cn/huiyi/dbdh/11_3/index.htm">Third Session</a> [official website, in Chinese] of the Eleventh National People&#39;s Congress and was <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/66102/6919334.html">hailed</a> [People&#39;s Daily report] by the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/">People&#39;s Daily</a>, a publication of the <a href="http://www.idcpc.org.cn/">Central Committee of the Communist Party of China</a> [official websites], as having a &quot;great significance to the improvement of the people&#39;s congress system and the development of the socialist democracy, as it could better demonstrate equality among people, regions and ethnic groups.&quot; The electoral reform <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/news/Legislation/2010-03/14/content_1563142.htm">also bans</a> family members of candidates from acting as ballot counters and has been <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/news/Legislation/2010-03/05/content_1549464.htm">described as key to equal rights</a> [Xinhua reports] by government officials. The NPC on Sunday also approved the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6920336.html">Government Work Report</a> [text], which predicts an 8 percent increase in GDP for 2010, along with the 2010 budget, including a 7.5 percent increase in defense spending over last year, and the work reports of the <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> and the <a href="http://www.spp.gov.cn/site2006/">Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate</a> [official websites, in Chinese].<br /><br />The electoral reforms were first <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-legislature-weighs-election.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] at the start of the annual session last Monday. China&#39;s prior electoral law provided four times as many congressional representatives to residents of urban districts than residents of rural ones. This ratio was an improvement over the previous one that had been in place since 1953, which <a href="http://www.zeenews.com/news611344.html">provided eight times as many representatives</a> [PTI report] for urban districts over rural ones. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee <a href="http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/1024/6416863.html">Wang Zhaoguo</a> [People&#39;s Daily profile, in Chinese] <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/NPC_CPPCC_2010/2010-03/08/content_19554098.htm">explained</a> [text] the need for the reform at the beginning of the session by pointing to the growth of the Chinese urban population since the last reform, which has grown from 13 percent in 1953 to nearly 30 percent in 1995, and in 2009 was nearing 50 percent. Despite reforms, China continues to face international criticism over human rights issues. China&#39;s human rights record <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">was criticized in the US annual rights report</a> for its repression of Tibetan and Uighur minorities, prompting <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-chides-us-on-rights-record-in.php">Chinese criticism of the US rights record</a> [JURIST reports] on issues of crime, racial discrimination, and poverty. China has also received criticism for its treatment of rights lawyer <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gao+Zhisheng">news archive</a>], who was last seen in public on February 4, 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italy&#8217;s highest administrative court, the <a href="http://www.giustizia-amministrativa.it/index.html">State Council</a> [official website, in Italian], announced Saturday that it would not restore a candidate list from the ruling coalition of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>]. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62C1HP20100313">candidate list for the region of Lazio was submitted late</a> [Reuters report] and contained People of Freedom party candidates for regional elections scheduled to be held at the end of this month. Lazio is the central province of Italy and includes Rome. The State Council&#8217;s decision flies in the face of an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8566450.stm">emergency government measure</a> [BBC report] instituted earlier this month to ensure that the list would be validated.   <br /><br />Earlier this month, the Italian <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">bill</a> [materials, in Italian] allowing cabinet ministers, including Berlusconi to postpone criminal proceedings against them on the grounds that they would interfere with official duties. Critics contend that the legislation is specifically designed to protect Berlusconi from the prosecutions he faces. In January, hundreds of Italy&#39;s judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. That bill was also criticized as being tailored for Berlusconi&#39;s benefit and would result in the automatic dismissal of two pending cases against him. Berlusconi was previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a>, and has had other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The former chief justice of the Supreme Court of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST news archive] on Monday criticized the government&#39;s treatment of detained opposition leader General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8356676.stm">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile]. Sarath Nanda Silva, who retired from the Sri Lankan Supreme Court last year, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100315/wl_sthasia_afp/srilankapoliticsmilitarycourtfonseka_20100315114038">accused</a> [AFP report] the government of using the military justice system to prevent Fonseka from participating in the upcoming elections scheduled for April 8, and of violating Fonseka&#39;s civil rights. Silva&#39;s charge implicates Fonseka&#39;s presence in the military, rather than civilian system, which he says provides no recourse for Fonseka. Silva also said that Fonseka&#39;s arrest was made in violation of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Introduction.htm">constitution</a> [text]. The military has charged Fonseka with mixing politics with the military, and improperly awarding procurement contracts. Fonseka&#39;s court-martial hearing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8568699.stm">begins on Tuesday</a> [BBC report]. Fonseka is also scheduled for a hearing before the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on April 26, where he will challenge his detention.<br /><br />Also Monday, Sri Lanka <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-46928520100315">criticized</a> [Reuters report] a US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">report</a> [JURIST report], released last week, which accused Sri Lanka of violating its citizens&#39; civil rights.

Also in February, Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/mahinda_rajapaksa.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who defeated Fonseka in the January election, dissolved parliament and called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-president-dissolves.php">early parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to harness momentum from his victory to gain more seats in parliament for his political party, Freedom Alliance. The Sri Lankan Supreme Court ruled last month that Rajapaksa&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-high-court-rules-presidents.php">second term</a> [JURIST report] will begin in November. Fonseka has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/02/20102816287441879.html">disputed</a> [Al Jazeera report] the election results, citing vote counting irregularities and violence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The California <a href="http://orangecountyda.com/home/index.asp">Orange County District Attorney</a> (OCDA) [official website] filed a <a href="http://orangecountyda.com/docs/toyota_complaint_--_ocda.pdf">consumer protection suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against car manufacturer <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a> [corporate website] on Friday, alleging that the company knowingly sold vehicles with acceleration defects.  The suit seeks up to $2,500 in penalties for each violation of California&#39;s <a href="http://www.yuricareport.com/CalifRecall/CalifUnfairPracticesAct.html">Unfair Business Practices Act</a> [text].  The OCDA <a href="http://orangecountyda.com/home/index.asp?page=8&recordid=1732&returnurl=index.asp%3Fpage%3D8">outlined</a> [press release] the case against Toyota, saying it<br /><blockquote><br />...intends to prove the following in the litigation: Despite knowledge of the defects, Toyota continues to sell and lease its cars and trucks while knowingly concealing and suppressing information about the defects from consumers. Since 2001, Toyota is accused of falsely representing to the public that Toyota-manufactured vehicles are safe and reliable. Toyota continues to conceal from consumers that their vehicles cause sudden, uncontrollable acceleration when drivers are not touching the accelerator and attempt to use their brakes.<br /></blockquote><br />In response to the OCDA announcement, Toyota said that it had <a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/orange-county-california-district-155076.aspx">not yet received the formal complaint</a> [press release] and would not comment on pending litigation. <br /><br />The OCDA suit is the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j7Q5UOWBM0Bbznp_qoaker39Ad1A">first consumer protection action</a> [AFP report] brought against Toyota by a US district attorney; numerous individuals, however, have already brought suits against the Japanese automaker seeking compensation for damages and injuries.  In a recent JURIST <a href="/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">op-ed</a>, law professor Bruce Aronson noted that Toyota&#39;s traditional governing structure contrasts with the typical American model and suggested that in light of its current manufacturing and public relations crisis, Toyota consider changing its corporate structure to give its board of directors more oversight power.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of 14 members of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=neo-nazi">neo-Nazi</a> [JURIST news archive] group, Nomad 88, opened Monday before the criminal court of Evry, in the Parisian suburbs. Founded in 2008 to &quot;purge&quot; the suburbs, the group gained public attention in May 2008 when three members went on a <a href="http://www.rue89.com/jean-yves-camus/essonne-un-groupe-skinhead-implique-dans-une-fusillade?page=1">shooting spree</a> [Rue89 report, in French] in an area with a strong population of immigrant origin. Following their arrest, the police seized a haul of weapons, including machine guns, along with a large quantity of ammunition and extremist literature. During the <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-41947342@7-40,0.html">hearing</a> [AFP report, in French], one of the defendants claimed they wanted to &quot;clear out&quot; the &quot;no-go&quot; areas in the suburbs. The trial is expected to last through Friday.<br /><br />Nomad 88 formed as a result of the 2005 civil unrest, when tension between the police and the youths of the suburbs was at its height, leading the government to decree that the country was in a <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/french-emergency-laws-helping-to-quell.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. Though extremist far-right groups represent only a fringe movement, the phenomenon is considered worrying because they operate in semi-clandestinity, and subsist despite efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/france-seeks-ban-on-neo-nazi-groups.php">clamp down on them</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three special masters sitting in the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Federal Court of Claims</a> [official website] Friday <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026/">rejected</a> [opinions, PDF] three compensation actions brought in a coordinated <a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Background_on_the_autism_proceedings.pdf">omnibus proceeding</a> [backgrounder, PDF; HRSA <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/omnibusproceeding.htm">backgrounder</a>] by families of autistic children who had argued that their children&#39;s autism was induced by vaccines containing mercury-laden thimerosol. The families had sought compensation under the no-fault <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> [HRSA backgrounder]. Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith wrote that her petitioners had not &quot;presented a scientifically sound theory&quot;, citing evidence that it was &quot;biologically implausible.&quot;  In February special masters in the same court <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/federal-court-rejects-cases-linking.php">rejected arguments</a> [JURIST report] made in three other test cases against the US Department of Health and Human Services by families alleging that their children&#39;s autism was caused by a combination of common childhood vaccines. <br /><br />Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, has been at the center of several health debates. In 2005, HHS officials said that <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/health-officials-warn-state.php">state laws prohibiting thimerosal could impede efforts</a> [JURIST report] to fight an avian flu pandemic should an outbreak occur. Most doctors believe thimerosal is safe, saying it does not affect the body in the same manner as mercury found in pollutants, but several groups claim that use of the preservative can be linked to neurological diseases including autism. Creation of mercury-free vaccines requires packaging individual doses, which is expected to pose a major problem if large batches of the vaccine need to be rushed in the event of an avian flu pandemic. Doctors partially attribute <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aiiTybT70ojc&refer=us">recent outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases</a> [Bloomberg report] in the US to an increasing reluctance among parents to expose children to vaccines.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Grand Chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=864619&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">ruled</a> [judgment; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=2&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=15766/03&sessionid=48946875&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] Tuesday that the practice of segregating <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma</a> [JURIST news archive] minority primary school students in Croatia from other pupils is discriminatory. The court declared the practice to be in contravention of Article 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits discrimination, and of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, which guarantees the right to an education. The court also found that the plaintiffs, 15 Roma citizens of Croatia, were deprived of their right to a fair trial within a reasonable amount of time, pursuant to Article 6 of the convention. The plaintiffs attended schools in northern Croatia between 1996 and 2000 and reported that they were segregated from other students and taught an inferior curriculum, suffering emotional and psychological harm as a result. Croatia&#39;s government countered that the Roma students were put in special classes because they lacked adequate command of the Croatian language. Tuesday&#39;s decision differs sharply from the ECHR&#39;s unanimous July 2008 <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=2&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Or%u0161u%u0161%20%7C%20Others%20%7C%20v.%20%7C%20Croatia&sessionid=48950328&skin=hudoc-en">decision</a> [text] in this case, which found no violation. <br /><br />Prior to this decision, the ECHR found segregated classes for Roma to be discriminatory in two other cases: <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=D.H.%20%7C%20Others%20%7C%20v.%20%7C%20the%20%7C%20Czech%20%7C%20Republic&sessionid=48958445&skin=hudoc-en">DH and Others v. the Czech Republic</a> [judgment] and <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Sampanis%20%7C%20v%20%7C%20Greece%20%7C%2032526/05&sessionid=48958853&skin=hudoc-en">Sampanis v. Greece</a> [judgment, in French]. However, discrimination against Roma in schools <a href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=3073">remains widespread</a> [press release] throughout Europe, according to the <a href="http://www.errc.org/English_index.php">European Roma Rights Center</a> (ERRC) [advocacy website]. Roma have also faced inequitable treatment in other spheres. The US State Department&#39;s 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">human rights report</a> [JURIST report] noted an increase in the killings of Roma people in <a href="/countries/italy.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hungary">Hungary</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=romania">Romania</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=slovakia">Slovakia</a>, and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=czech+republic">Czech Republic</a> [JURIST news archives]. In February of last year, Italian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-begins-dismantling-roma-camps.php">dismantled illegal immigrant camps</a> [JURIST report] heavily populated by members of the Roma minority following the alleged rape of a 14-year old girl by East European immigrants, which led to public outcry and vigilante reprisals. In 2008, then-secretary general of the Council of Europe Terry Davis called on officials to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/roma-minority-in-need-of-protection.php">end discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against Europe&#39;s Roma minority, after a confrontation between Czech police and far-right protesters attempting to attack a Roma suburb near the town of Litvinov.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor CL &quot;Butch&quot; Otter</a> (R) [official website] on Wednesday became the first governor to sign a <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2010/H0391.htm">bill</a> [H 391 text] into state law banning any federal mandate for individuals to have health insurance. The Idaho Health Freedom Act orders the state attorney general to file a lawsuit against the national government over any law making health insurance mandatory. The bill highlights efforts the state has made in local health care reform and stresses the state government&#39;s determination to <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/mediacenter/press/pr2010/prmar10/pr_023.html">oppose federal health care legislation</a> [press release]. State Senate minority leader <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/senate/membershipSingle.cfm?ID=90">Kate Kelly</a> (D) [official website] criticized the price tag on the new bill and accused Otter of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/health/policy/18brfs-GOVERNORSIGN_BRF.html">fiscal irresponsibility</a> [AP report]. The legislation will face legal challenges under the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#a6">Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution</a> [Senate backgrounder], which gives federal law precedence over state law.<br /><br />Last week, the Virginia legislature passed a similar bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">ban federal mandates on health insurance</a> [JURIST report], which the state&#39;s governor has pledged to sign. At least 37 other states have plans to introduce similar legislation, according to the <a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home">American Legislative Council</a> (ALEC) [official website], which <a href="http://www.alec.org/Content/NavigationMenu/ALECNEWS/PressReleases/release_4/default.htm">published a model bill</a> [press release] on which the initiatives are based. Last month, President Barack Obama released his own <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-unveils-proposal-to-reconcile.php">health care proposal</a> [JURIST report] that seeks to reconcile versions of the bill passed by the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/house-passes-landmark-health-care.php">House</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] last year. Obama has argued that the legislation would overhaul private health insurance and provide affordable care for millions of Americans while Republicans have said they would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/health/policy/25health.html?_r=1&hp">block the bill</a> [NYT report] because it was too expensive and would compel people to buy health insurance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/092144p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that a Pennsylvania prosecutor cannot file child pornography charges against a teenage girl whose topless photo was found on a number of her schoolmates&#39; cell phones, upholding a preliminary injunction. Wyoming County prosecutor George Skumanick threatened to bring felony charges against several students who possessed or appeared in nude and semi-nude pictures of underage girls found on cell phones of students in the Tunkahannock, Pennsylvania, School District if the students did not attend a program on sexual violence and gender identity. Three girls refused to attend the class and sought a temporary injunction prohibiting prosecution, which the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-enjoins-child-pornography.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] last March. Skumanick&#39;s successor promised not to prosecute two of the girls, leaving only one plaintiff on appeal. The appellate court held that the district court properly issued the injunction since it appeared that the state threatened to prosecute the girl in retaliation for exercising her First Amendment right not to write certain essays that would have been part of the program and for her parents exercising their Fourteenth Amendment right to control their child&#39;s education. The court also found that it was unlikely that the prosecution could be successful since there was no evidence that the girl manufactured or distributed the photo. The court stated:<br /><blockquote><br />At this preliminary stage we conclude that plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on their claims that any prosecution would not be based on probable cause that Doe committed a crime, but instead in retaliation for Doe&#39;s exercise of her constitutional rights not to attend the education program. Therefore, we affirm the grant of a preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings.<br /></blockquote><br />The lawyer for Skumanick said that while he was <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/88337702.html">disappointed with the ruling</a> [<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> report], he was pleased that the court declined to rule that the photos themselves were protected by the First Amendment.<br /><br /><br />The plaintiffs were represented by the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLUPA) [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/MillerComplaintfinal.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; case <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/legal/legaldocket/milleretalvskumanick">materials</a>] against Skumanick last year. ACLUPA lawyer Witold Walczak <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/aclusueswyomingcountydafor.htm">contends</a> [press release] that the photos are protected by the First Amendment and that requiring the girls to attend a re-education program interferes with the parents&#39; rights to raise their daughters as they wish. According to the complaint, <a href="http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/sextech/PDF/SexTech_Summary.pdf">20 percent of teens nationwide</a> [survey results, PDF] have participated in the distribution of similar pictures, a phenomenon known as &quot;sexting.&quot; This is the first circuit court ruling on the issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website] <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/march2010/191002.htm">ruled</a> [judgment text; <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/news/courtnews%20flash/2010/03/03171001.php">press release</a>] Wednesday that the constitution does not prevent <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">profile</a>] from replacing retiring Chief Justice Reynato Puno prior to the May presidential elections. The court <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/248216/sc-gma-can-appoint-cj">found</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Manila Bulletin</span> report] that the constitutional provisions that prevent the president from appointing officials immediately before or after elections do not apply to the Supreme Court or to the judiciary in general. The court found:<br /><blockquote><br />The lack of any appointed occupant of the office of Chief Justice harms the independence of the Judiciary, because the Chief Justice is the head of the entire Judiciary. The Chief Justice performs functions absolutely significant to the life of the nation. With the entire Supreme Court being the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, the Chief Justice is the Chairman of the Tribunal. There being no obstacle to the appointment of the next Chief Justice, aside from its being mandatory for the incumbent President to make within the 90-day period from May 17, 2010, there is no justification to insist that the successor of Chief Justice Puno be appointed by the next President.<br /></blockquote><br />Individuals running to replace Arroyo as president <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/186385/five-presidential-bets-oppose-sc-decision-on-chief-justice-issue">expressed</a> [GMA News report] displeasure with the court&#39;s decision, suggesting that the ruling gives the current president too much influence.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has previously sided with Arroyo, ruling last month that she is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">eligible to run for senate</a> [JURIST report] after her presidential term expires. The court found the law requiring appointed officials to resign when they declare their candidacy for elected office is constitutional, but that the ruling does not affect elected officials. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the November massacre in the semi-autonomous Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. Among those charged is Andal Ampatuan Sr., a former political ally to Arroyo, head of a Muslim clan, and former governor of Maguindanao province. Following the killings, Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> in the province. She later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-lifts-martial-law.php">lifted the conditions</a>, following <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/rights-group-urges-philippines.php">international pressure</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/some-philippines-judges-want-high-court.php">domestic legal challenges</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in Sierra Leone ruled Tuesday that a woman has the right to become a regional political leader in the country. The <a href="http://www.statehouse-sl.org/judiciary.html">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] reversed a previous ban that had prevented Iye Kendor Bandabla from her birthright to compete for the position of paramount chief in her local district. The decision also upheld the <a href="http://www.sierra-leone.org/Laws/2009-10.pdf">2009 Chieftaincy Act</a> [text, PDF], which includes both gender pronouns in describing paramount chief candidate qualifications, suggesting that the legislators&#39; intent was to allow both men and women to run for the position. Women are allowed to become chiefs in the southern regions, but traditionalists have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8569943.stm">banned women from holding the powerful position</a> [BBC report] in rest of the country. <br /><br />In December, a Sierra Leone court ruled against another woman, Elizabeth Simbiwa Sogbo-Tortu, saying that she <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8413266.stm">could not become chief in her region</a> [BBC report]. Tortu filed a complaint after traditionalists prevented her from running for the position, and she is currently pursuing a Supreme Court hearing. There is also <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83393">evidence of discrimination</a> [IRIN report] against women running for parliament, where only about 13 percent of the representatives are women. Sierra Leone has a history of human rights violations, but has been working to improve its rights record. The <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) [official website] was <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=uClnd1MJeEw%3d&tabid=70">established ten years ago</a> [text, PDF] in a joint endeavor by the government of Sierra Leone and the UN to provide a forum to try those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law, committed in Sierra Leone. In November, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">handed over its detention facility</a> [JURIST report] to the Sierra Leone Prison Service in a monumental step towards the court&#39;s resolution. After <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-upholds.php">upholding the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of several former soldiers in October, and with only <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">one remaining indictment</a> [JURIST report] against former Liberian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=special+court+for+sierra+leone">Charles Taylor</a> [JURIST news archive], the SCSL has largely fulfilled its purpose and will continue taking steps to close down.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Internet has experienced a 20 percent increase in militant and hate content over the past year, according to a report released on Monday by the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441251">Simon Wiesenthal Center for Tolerance</a> [advocacy website]. The report, titled &quot;Digital Terrorism and Hate 2010,&quot; <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/15/hate.speech.social.networks/">cites</a> [CNN report] to the low levels of regulation of Internet content as one of the enabling conditions of the increase. The increase is most prevalent in social networking sites and personal blogs. The report also singles out some examples of websites whose creators went on to carry out terrorist or hate crimes, and warned that content found online not only incited, but also detailed how to carry out such crimes.<br /><br />The US State Department 2010 annual rights report <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">released</a> [JURIST report] last week decries Internet censorship abroad. In August, the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/index.jsp">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website] reported that right-wing nativist and so-called &quot;patriot&quot; anti-government militias are again <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/anti-government-militias-growing-in-us.php">on the rise</a> [JURIST report] in the US. The SPLC said that such groups, which had declined severely since the 1990s, are generally anti-tax, anti-immigration, and increasingly racially motivated since the election of the country&#39;s first African-American president, Barack Obama.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Democrats on the Senate <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Banking Committee</a> [official website] on Monday introduced the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/ChairmansMark31510AYO10306_xmlFinancialReformLegislationBill.pdf">Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF], aimed at increasing financial regulation in the wake of the recent financial crisis. The bill includes a provision meant to protect consumers from predatory lending by creating a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau housed within the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website]. The proposed legislation would also give the government the power to break up financial institutions that have been deemed &quot;too big to fail&quot; in order to prevent future situations where the failing of one firm could threaten the entire economy. The &quot;Volcker Rule,&quot; prohibiting banks from owning, investing in, or sponsoring hedge funds, private equity funds, or proprietary trading funds for profit where the funds do not benefit the banks&#39; customers, was also included in the proposed legislation. Other provisions included in the bill involve the restructuring of the federal banking system, regulation of the credit-rating agencies, and the creation of a committee to identify and manage risks to the economy. The executive session to mark up the bill is scheduled to begin on Monday. <br /><br />This bill is the second financial reform bill to be proposed by the Senate Banking Committee following the 2008 financial crisis. The <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf">2009 bill</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">report</a>] was met with resistance and resulted in the committee&#39;s development of the new bill. In December, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report]. The US <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> to create a consumer financial protection agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving the Obama administration&#39;s stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. In June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.

		<title>China officials warn Google to obey state Internet laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese officials on Tuesday repeated warnings to <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website] that even if the company decides to leave the country, it must <a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/ae/ah/201003/20100306824151.html">obey Chinese laws</a> [press release, in Chinese] and continue to filter search results. Spokesperson for China&#39;s <a href="http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/">Ministry of Commerce</a> [official website, in Chinese] Yao Jian said that Google agreed to follow Chinese laws when it entered the market in 2006 and again warned the company to continue to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62E11L20100316">respect</a> [Reuters report] the country&#39;s legal regulations. Although Google has threatened to stop filtering search results, spokesperson for Google China Marsha Wang said Monday that the company is currently <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-03/16/content_9593928.htm">complying with censoring regulations</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report] and has not received any instructions to shut down. Last week, China&#39;s <a href="http://www.miit.gov.cn/">Minister of Industry and Information Technology</a> [official website, in Chinese] <a href="http://liyizhong.miit.gov.cn/">Li Yizhong</a> [official profile, in Chinese] told reporters that a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hyxPaSAvdmIPwKHXROKfG_a19YjQ">failure by Google to follow Chinese laws</a> [AFP report] would result in consequences, but did not state any specific actions.<br /><br />In February, China issued new regulations <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">tightening restrictions on Internet use</a> [JURIST report] by requiring citizens operating websites to submit identity cards and meet with regulators before their sites can be registered. The new policies came as the Chinese government continues negotiations with Google regarding the Internet company&#39;s January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">threat to discontinue operations in China</a> [JURIST report] due to the country&#39;s overarching Internet censorship. Google&#39;s action was in response to a cyber attack on its Gmail service in December, which targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists in China and drew the ire of rights groups around the world. Google indicated that it would work with the Chinese government to find a way to allow an, &quot;unfiltered search engine within the law as well,&quot; but also noted that if an agreement cannot be reached, it may close its offices there and shut down its <a href="http://www.google.cn/">Google.cn</a> [search engine] website. China <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">responded</a> [JURIST report] by reiterating its commitment to open Internet, but stressed that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. A week later, US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-defends-internet-freedom-policies.php">referenced the threat</a> [JURIST report] by Google in a speech promoting Internet freedom and criticizing censorship, declaring that China &quot;risk[s] walling themselves off from the progress of the next century.&quot; Chinese <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu criticized Clinton for her remarks stating that they were harmful to bilateral relations between the US and China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Human rights group <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/cuba-urged-revoke-repressive-laws-and-release-prisoners-conscience-2010-03-17">urged</a> [press release] Cuban authorities to &quot;revoke laws that restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association and to release all dissidents unfairly detained by the authorities.&quot;  AI called on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5234790.stm">President Raul Castro</a> [BBC profile] to invite UN experts and human rights organizations into the country to independently monitor the human rights situation.  Currently, international independent human rights organizations are not permitted in the country.  AI&#39;s statement also condemned vague legislation because it is &quot;currently being interpreted in a way that infringes fundamental freedoms.&quot;  For example, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/86549/section/14">Article 72</a> [AI translation] of the Cuban Criminal Code makes &quot;dangerousness&quot; a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gsdr-fRxAzXGO3iVCvHhenOLzGSgD9EG27380">jailable offense</a> [AP report].  The statement was released as the 7th anniversary of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jKEDg-5PPF5R8nIBoPv4mxcs99jgD9EGHPV80">the arrest of 75 Cuban dissidents</a> [AP report] nears, with 53 of those arrested remaining in jail today.<br /><br />Last week, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] criticized Cuba for interfering with the right to privacy in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">report</a>].  In November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/cuba1109web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cuba-continues-political-repression.php">report</a>] claiming that the Cuban government continued to repress dissidents and violate fundamental civil liberties of Cubans, and resorted to imposing short-term imprisonment measures to elude international critique. According to a February 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/todo-sobre/organismo/CCDHRN/Comision/Cubana/Derechos/Humanos/Reconciliacion/Nacional/575/">Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation</a> (CCDHRN) [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> backgrounder, in Spanish], the number of political prisoners in Cuba had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-reports-decline-in-number.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] from 234 in January 2008 to 205, while the number of brief detentions had increased. In January, HRW acknowledged some attempts in 2008 by the Cuban government to improve its position on human rights in its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2009">World Report 2009</a> [materials]. HRW decried that overall the Cuban government continues to deny its citizens their fundamental rights. In 2008, Cuba was ranked 170th in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/press-freedom-index-moves-us-up-war.php">eighth annual Worldwide Index of Press Freedom</a> [JURIST report] issued by <a href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=20">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RWB) [advocacy website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The State of Law Coalition led by Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Wednesday asked the <a href="http://www.ihec.iq/english/index.htm">Independent High Electoral Commission</a> (IHEC) [official website] to recount ballots cast in the March 7 <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">parliamentary election</a> [JURIST news archive], alleging fraud. State of Law spokesperson Ali Al Adib claimed that the ballots were <a href="http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=24936">manipulated</a> [AP report] by the manager of an electronic counting center who is allegedly linked to the rival Iraqiya bloc, led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi. The allegations of fraud come after Iraqiya showed a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/03/20103179262644270.html">slight lead</a> [Al Jazeera report] in a partial vote count released earlier this week. Allawi&#39;s coalition leads the race with seven out of 18 provinces, but the Iraqiya bloc is close behind, leading in five provinces. The IHEC said that there was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9EFUT100">no evidence</a> [AP report] to back up the allegations. The election determines the 325 members of the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq">Iraqi Council of Representatives</a> [official website, in Arabic] who will then elect the prime minister and president.<br /><br />The fraud allegations are the latest in a series of problems plaguing the parliamentary elections. Last month, an Iraqi appeals panel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-allows-28-banned.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 28 previously banned candidates could stand for election. The Responsibility and Justice Committee had initially ruled that some 500 banned candidates could stand for election despite allegations of ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder].  The decision was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once. Last year,  the Iraqi parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iraq-lawmakers-approve-amended-election.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amended version of a controversial election law after numerous delays. The new version of the law increased the number of seats in parliament from 275 to 325, with 310 of those seats allotted to Iraq&#39;s 18 provinces and the remainder reserved for Iraqis living outside the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-296880A1.pdf">sent</a> [press release, PDF] to Congress its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">National Broadband Plan</a> [materials], which seeks to enact regulations to update the communications infrastructure in the US and to make broadband service available to millions of Americans. The plan is mandated by provisions of the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/About/Pages/The_Act.aspx">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> (ARRA) [materials]. Notable goals of the plan include providing 100 million households with affordable 100-megabits-per-second Internet service, making 500 megahertz of wireless spectrum available for licensed and unlicensed use by mobile applications, and ensuring that all children are literate in digital technology by the time they leave high school. FCC <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Chairman Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-296911A1.pdf">commented</a> [statement, PDF] on why the project is so important:<blockquote>First, because broadband is essential to our global competitiveness - essential to job creation in a digital economy, to ongoing investment in vital 21st century infrastructure, and to our ability to lead the world in innovation. <br /><br />Second, because broadband is essential for opportunity in America - for all Americans, from all communities and backgrounds, living in rural towns, inner cities, or in between. <br /><br />And, third, because broadband is essential to solving so many of the challenges facing our nation - including education, health care, energy and public safety, each of which is specifically mentioned in the Congressional directive.</blockquote>The broadband plan calls for action on all branches of the federal government, state and local governments, and private and nonprofit business sectors.<br /><br />Going forward the plan will be the subject of a number of Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which allow for public comment on the proposed regulations. The plan follows the FCC&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">vote</a> [JURIST report] in October to <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-93A1.pdf">approve the formation of rules</a> [notice, PDF] mandating so-called <a href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html">&quot;net neutrality&quot;</a> [Google backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">news archive</a>], promising openness commensurate with the ideals of the Internet itself. The idea of net neutrality, supported unanimously by the FCC commissioners, is to allow an open flow of information over the Internet, regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. The implementation of the new rules has been vigorously opposed by telecommunications giants <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a> and <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> [corporate websites], among others, which argue that such rules would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] said Wednesday that he would <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp">not delay his plan</a> [statement text] to set up a UN panel to investigate allegations of human rights violations during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">Sri Lankan civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Ban made the statement during a press conference in response to a question about a <a href="http://www.lankapuvath.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6239&Itemid=70">letter</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Lankapuvath</span> report] from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/2798187.stm">Non-Aligned Movement</a> (NAM) [BBC backgrounder] to the secretary-general last week. Ban responded that the letter, which challenged the UN&#39;s authority to form the panel, was a misunderstanding, and he made clear his intention to form the panel:<br /><blockquote><br />[T]his panel will report to me directly and not to any other body. It is well within my power, I believe. I am convinced that it is well within my power as Secretary-General of the United Nations to ask such a body to furnish me with their advice of this nature. This does not in any way infringe on the sovereignty of Sri Lanka.<br /></blockquote><br />Ban added that there would be, &quot;no delay in the establishment of the panel.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/mahinda_rajapaksa.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20100306_05">rejected</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sri-lanka-president-rejects-proposed-un.php">report</a>] Ban&#39;s plan to appoint a panel of experts to look into alleged rights abuses in the island nation&#39;s civil war, saying it &quot;is totally uncalled for and unwarranted.&quot; Just prior to Rajapaksa&#39;s statement, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org /sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-chief-criticizes-iran-sri.php">criticized the state of human rights</a> [JURIST report] in Sri Lanka, while <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/HCannualreportHRC.aspx">presenting her annual report</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/13session/">13th Session</a> [official website] of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] released its <a href="http://centralcontent.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/human-rights-reports/human-rights-report-2009">Annual Report on Human Rights 2009</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday, noting the increasing demand for human rights by citizens throughout the world. The report also cited the contrasting argument by some governments that human rights are merely a Western construct that are unnecessary or inappropriate in certain countries. Introducing the report, UK <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/who-we-are/our-ministers/d-miliband">Foreign Secretary David Miliband</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&id=21905651">said</a> [press release] that several steps must be taken to uphold human rights around the world:<blockquote>First, we must support the struggle for civil rights. When courageous protestors make their voices heard on the streets of Iran for example, we, making clear their desire for democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms; and when their Government responds with brutality, then we&#39;re right to speak up.<br /><br />Second, we should provide practical help that meets individual countries&#39; specific needs, working with civil society rather than lecturing Government. ...<br /><br />Thirdly, we need to recognise that new technologies transform the ability of individuals to organise in the face of authoritarianism.</blockquote>The report mentioned 22 countries of concern, including <a href="/countries/myanmar.php">Myanmar</a> for its detention of political prisoners including opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archives]. Despite improved commitments to human rights in <a href="/countries/israel.php">Israel</a> and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=palestine">Occupied Palestinian Territories</a> [JURIST news archives], the report expressed concerns with Israeli actions in East Jerusalem and restrictions on the Gaza Strip as well as the Palestinian Authority&#39;s failure to condemn violence. The report indicated that human rights have decreased in <a href="/countries/iran.php">Iran</a> and <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archives] since 2008. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST news archive] was the only new country added to the list.<br /><br />Last week, the US State Department released its <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">annual reports</a> [JURIST report] on human rights conditions in almost 200 countries. Last year&#39;s FCO report <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uk-cites-counter-terrorism-policies.php">focused on terrorism and global warming</a> [JURIST report] as key issues. The UK also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/china-ignoring-human-rights-in-tibet-uk.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the rights situations in many of the same countries in its 2007 report.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] unanimously passed <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:s.01789:">legislation</a> [S 1789 materials] Wednesday to reduce sentencing disparities for powder and crack <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cocaine">cocaine</a> [JURIST news archive] offenses. The Fair Sentencing Act, introduced by Senator <a href="http://durbin.senate.gov/">Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL) [official website], would amend existing law to reduce the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions from 100:1 to 18:1. Durbin, who originally voted for the sentencing disparity, said that he would have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g0XzGoOTbT4FqdIZXy5mtu7jVNMQD9EGNTT80">preferred a 1:1 sentencing ratio</a> [AP report] but was happy with the compromise. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] praised the bill but said it does not go far enough and that the proposed sentencing disparities would still disproportionately affect African-Americans. Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office Laura Murphy <a href="http://www.aclu.org/drug-law-reform/senate-unanimously-passes-cocaine-sentencing-legislation">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The Fair Sentencing Act is an encouraging step toward eliminating the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine but still allows for a needlessly unfair sentencing framework. The unanimous passage of this bill speaks to the understanding across the political spectrum that this disparity is unjust and in need of reform. Years of research has yielded no evidence of any appreciable difference between crack and powder cocaine and yet we continue to inflict this disparity on Americans.<br /><br />For over two decades, this sentencing disparity has been a stain on our justice system. Though this bill&#39;s passage is long overdue, it does not go far enough. Without a simple and fair 1-1 sentencing ratio for crack and powder cocaine, we cannot say that these sentencing laws meet constitutional muster.</blockquote>The proposed law would also eliminate the five-year mandatory sentence for first-time possession of crack cocaine and would increase monetary penalties for drug trafficking. An identical version of the bill is expected to be passed by the House and signed into law by President Barack Obama.<br /><br />The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-judiciary-committee-approves.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] earlier this month. In July, the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-passes-bill-to.php">completely eliminate</a> [JURIST report] the sentencing disparity. US <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ag-holder-urges-cocaine-sentencing.php">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-urges-end-to-cocaine-sentencing.php">other officials</a> [JURIST reports] have also spoken publicly in favor of sentencing reform. In 2008, more than 3000 inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses had their sentences <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/031510zr.pdf">refused</a> [order, PDF] to stay the execution of Lawrence Reynolds, an Ohio inmate challenging the state&#39;s lethal injection procedure. Reynolds, who was convicted of strangling an elderly neighbor to death in 1994, asked the Supreme Court to postpone his execution in order to allow him time to assert his challenge. The court declined to delay the execution without comment. This is the state of Ohio&#39;s <a href="http://www2.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/article/ohio_tries_for_3rd_time_to_execute_inmate/33449/">third attempt</a> [AP report] at executing Reynolds. Ohio Governor Ted Strickland <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] Reynolds&#39;s original execution date last fall, as the state was reviewing its execution method. Reynolds&#39;s execution was again delayed last week when prison guards found the inmate unconscious in his cell due to an overdose on pills. Reynolds is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday.<br /><br />In December, Ohio prison officials conducted the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">first execution</a> [JURIST report] using a new single-drug lethal injection protocol. Death row inmate Kenneth Biros was executed after the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/120809zr.pdf">rejected</a> [order, PDF] a last-minute stay application. Biros&#39;s attorneys had argued that the use of the new procedure constitutes human experimentation, but some commentators have said that the single-drug protocol is more humane than the previous three-drug method. Ohio became the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">first state to adopt</a> [JURIST report] the single-drug protocol in November. The state undertook a review of its lethal injection practices in September after the planed execution of inmate Romell Broom <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-delays-ohio-execution.php">failed</a> [JURIST reports] when a suitable vein for the drugs&#39; administration could not be found. The new protocol consists of the intravenous injection of a single anesthetic, and provides for the intramuscular injection of two other drugs if an appropriate vein cannot be found.<br /><br />11:45 AM ET - Reynolds was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/03/16/us/AP-US-Ohio-Execution.html?_r=1">executed</a> [AP report] at 10:27 AM.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-3-16-ACLUvDOJ-Complaint_0.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Tuesday seeking information related to the US government&#39;s use of unmanned Predator drones. The suit, filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia, seeks to enforce a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-1-13-PredatorDroneFOIARequest.pdf">request</a> [text, PDF] made in January. The ACLU alleges that the unmanned warplanes have been used by the military and CIA for killings in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The ACLU also cites troubling reports indicating that US citizens may be targeted and killed by Predator drones. The FOIA request asks &quot;when, where and against whom drone strikes can be authorized,&quot; as well as for information related to civilian casualties. Director of the ACLU National Security Project Jameel Jaffer <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-seeks-information-predator-drone-program">emphasized</a> [press release] the importance of the information requested:<br /><blockquote><br />The government&#39;s use of drones to conduct targeted killings raises complicated questions - not only legal questions, but policy and moral questions as well. ... These kinds of questions ought to be discussed and debated publicly, not resolved secretly behind closed doors. While the Obama administration may legitimately withhold intelligence information as well as sensitive information about military strategy, it should disclose basic information about the scope of the drone program, the legal basis for the program and the civilian casualties that have resulted from the program.<br /></blockquote><br />The Air Force has more than 20 Predator drones operating in Afghanistan, and the role of the unmanned drones has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/world/asia/20drones.html">increased</a> [NYT report] in recent years.<br /><br />In October, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">noted</a> [JURIST report] that the use of unmanned warplanes by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan may be illegal. Alston said, &quot;[t]he onus is really on the government of the United States to reveal more about the ways in which it makes sure that arbitrary executions, extrajudicial executions, are not in fact being carried out through the use of these weapons.&quot;  Alston criticized the US policy in a report to the UN General Assembly&#39;s human rights committee that was presented as part of a larger demand that no state be free from accountability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1391">said</a> [transcript; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34103&Cr=icty&Cr1=">report</a>] on Tuesday that the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] will continue to operate beyond its originally planned end date at the end of this year. Ban estimated that it will be necessary for the court to remain open until 2013. Part of the reason for the extension is that two of the primary suspects remain at large. Bosnian Serb commander <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>] and political leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/694/4">Goran Hadzic</a> [case materials] both face a significant number of charges. Ban said:<br /><blockquote><br />When these Special Tribunals were established, they were established for a temporary purpose with a certain date fixed. ... There is some broad agreement now that ICTY may need at least a few more years, to 2013 or so. Our hope is that all these pending cases should be expedited. If and when these two fugitives are arrested, then we will have to discuss again how we can adjust, or we can leave it to other mechanisms - this was discussed already between the ICTY and the Security Council. At this time, since we do not have any clear idea when these two fugitives would be arrested, with the help of those countries concerned, then they should live up to their schedules according to exit strategies.<br /></blockquote><br />Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for overseeing the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison massacre and other killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, while Hadzic faces crimes against humanity charges for killings of non-Serbs and for abuses in Croatian prison camps. <br /><br />Despite two of the highest-level targets remaining fugitives, the ICTY continues to actively prosecute other criminals. Last week, the court heard opening statements in the trial of <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>]. Karadzic claims that attacks against Bosnian Muslims were &quot;staged,&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">denying</a> [JURIST reports] any involvement in war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Last month, Karadzic appeared before the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/karadzic-claims-documents-evidence.php">seeking access to documents</a> [JURIST report] he claimed showed evidence of weapons smuggling to Bosnian Muslims. Also last month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-begins-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">opened the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/791/4">Zdravko Tolimir</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zdravko+tolimir">news archive</a>]. Tolimir is <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tolimir/ind/en/091104.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, and murder against Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica. The ICTY has indicted 161 political and military officials since its creation in 1993.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Afghanistan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/index_eng.aspx">Office of the President</a> [official website] openly confirmed for the first time on Tuesday that the government has enacted a law providing a blanket pardon for all war crimes and human rights violations occurring before December 2001. Spokesperson Waheed Omar said that the <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1074897.html">National Stability and Reconciliation Law</a> [RFE/RL backgrounder] was passed in 2007 by two-thirds of the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/PME/Default.aspx">Parliament</a> [official website], and therefore, under the constitution, did not require the signature of <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/sroot_eng.aspx?id=166">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile]. The new law has been heavily criticized by human rights groups, which became aware of the law when it was published in Afghanistan&#39;s latest official gazette. In an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62F2LU20100316">interview with Reuters</a> [Reuters report], Asia director for <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] Brad Adams called the law an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot; and &quot;a slap in the face to all the Afghans who suffered for years and years of war crimes and warlordism.&quot; Adams questioned the validity of the two-year process taken to enact law, which was passed by a parliament made up largely of former members of armed groups, some of whom have been accused of war crimes. Adams has called on the US to pressure Afghanistan to repeal the law stating that &quot;the US needs to decide whether they&#39;re with the victims or the perpetrators, and make their views known publicly.&quot; US President Barack Obama, who <a href="http://president.gov.af/Contents/88/Documents/1450/afg_us.html">held a teleconference</a> [press release] with Karzai on Monday concerning the &quot;continued strategic partnership&quot; between the US and Afghanistan, has yet to release a statement concerning the amnesty law.<br /><br />HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-afghanistan-to.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] last week urging the Afghan government to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/10/afghanistan-repeal-amnesty-law">retract the amnesty law</a> [press release]. HRW claims that the law protects alleged war criminals and human rights abusers, many of whom remain in positions of power within the government. The group says the law will also grant future immunity to people involved in current fighting in Afghanistan if they agree to reconciliation with the government. Supporters of the law note that criminal claims may still be brought by individuals, but HRW disputes this claim saying the court system is &quot;barely functioning in much of the country, corruption is rampant, and there is no witness protection system.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK High Court <a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/520.html&query=catholic+and+care&method=boolean">ruled</a> [judgment text] Wednesday that the Catholic social services agency <a href="http://www.catholic-care.org.uk/">Catholic Care</a> [agency website] may refuse to consider same-sex couples as candidates for adoption, pending a review of their policy by the UK Charity Commission. The case revolved around interpretation of Regulation 18 of <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/uksi_20071263_en_1#l1g18">The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations of 2007</a> [materials]. That legislation forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation, except for charities, which, under Regulation 18, can refuse to assist individuals as long as they are acting as a &quot;charitable instrument&quot; and the restriction, &quot;is imposed by reason of or on the grounds of the provisions of the charitable instrument.&quot; Based on the Chancery Division&#39;s reading of that regulation, Catholic Care will be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/17/catholic-adoption-gay-parents">permitted to continue its adoption practices</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] until the Charity Commission makes a ruling based on the court&#39;s interpretation of Regulation 18. In remitting the case for that ruling, Justice Briggs wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />On my interpretation of Regulation 18, the Commission is the body charged by Parliament with the task of carrying out that analysis. ... I have no reason to suppose that, directed as to the true interpretation of Regulation 18, the Charity Commission will not properly be able to carry out that analysis, either on the facts thus far proved, or upon the basis of such further evidence as it may consider necessary and appropriate to take into account.<br /></blockquote><br />The Bishop of Leeds <a href="http://www.catholic-care.org.uk/news/fullstory.php?newsid=51">issued a statement</a> [press release] through Catholic Care calling the decision a victory and saying it, &quot;will help in our determination to continue to provide this invaluable service to benefit children, families and communities.&quot; The gay rights charity <a href="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/">Stonewall</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.stonewall.org.uk/media/current_releases/3755.asp">condemned the ruling</a> [press release], saying, &quot;[i]t&#39;s clearly in the best interests of children in care to encourage as wide a pool of potential adopters as possible.&quot; Other Catholic agencies in the UK had either broken their ties to the Roman Catholic Church to comply with the new regulations, or had ceased their adoption operations. With the victory for Catholic Care, it is unclear whether those UK charities that had abandoned their adoption services will now begin providing those services again.<br /><br />Same-sex adoption has been an issue not only in the UK, but also in other countries. In February, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-orders-state-to.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state of Louisiana to place the names of two fathers on the birth certificate of a boy born in that state but adopted by a same-sex couple in New York. In November, a French court ruled that a law prohibiting same-sex couples from adopting children in France is <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/france-court-rules-gay-woman-may-adopt.php">discriminatory</a> [JURIST report] and ordered that a single woman be allowed to adopt. In September, Uruguay&#39;s Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uruguay-senate-gives-final-approval-to.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex adoption in that country. In November 2008, the same month that a Florida judge ruled that state&#39;s ban on same-sex adoption was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/florida-judge-rules-gay-adoption-ban.php">unconstitutional</a>, voters in Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] a ballot measure prohibiting all unmarried couples from adopting a child. Arkansas does not recognize same-sex marriage, and proponents of the act claimed it was aimed at same-sex couples.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] on Tuesday defended his intention to try suspected terrorists, including accused 9/11 conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC Profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] in civilian criminal court. Holder faced numerous questions on the issue while <a href="http://appropriations.edgeboss.net/wmedia-live/appropriations/33698/282_appropriations-happrops_080213.asx">testifying</a> [video; <a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/Witness_testimony/CJS/Attorney_General_Holder.3.16.10.pdf">prepared testimony</a>, PDF] before a <a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/">House Appropriations</a> [official website] subcommittee, repeatedly defending the decision to use federal courts, as opposed to <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Holder drew distinctions between individuals to be tried in each venue based on the target of the terrorist act, the evidentiary rules available in each forum, and the national security considerations stemming from each method. Holder then defended the competency of judges in civilian courts in dealing with disruptive defendants, who would attempt to use their trial as a podium for their views. In discussing the possible safety of communities where the trials may be held, Holder said, &quot;[l]ook at history, look at the way in which these cases have been conducted safely, without incident to communities and neighborhoods that surround the courthouses where these cases have been held,&quot; specifically citing the trial of <a href="/currentawareness/moussaoui.php">Zacarias Moussaoui</a> [JURIST news archive]. In terms of a timeline for when the final decision on the venue for these trials might be made, Holder indicated that a decision is still &quot;weeks away.&quot;<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], a group that has been persistent in its advocacy of civilian trials for 9/11 suspects, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/attorney-general-holder-defends-decision-try-911-suspects-federal-court">expressed support</a> [press release] for Holder&#39;s decision. Earlier this month, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after reports that White House advisers are <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. Holder announced in November that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism. Holder has previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to charge suspected terrorist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [JURIST news archive], the so-called Christmas Day bomber, in US federal court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian authorites jailed a reform movement leader after an appeals court <a href="http://www.kaleme.com/1388/12/28/klm-14690">upheld</a> [Kaleme report, in Persian] a one-year-sentence for spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic, according to an opposition website Friday. Hossein Marashi was a leading supporter of Mir Hossein Mousavi who opposed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ahmadinejad">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [JURIST news archive] in the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] last June. Marashi was an opposition party spokesman for the Executives of Construction and previously served as head of cultural and tourism under former president Mohammed Khatami. The court also <a href="http://news.ph.msn.com/top-stories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3971318">upheld</a> [AFP report] a ban on Marashi from participating in party political activity for six years.<br /><br />Earlier this month, an Iranian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iran-appeals-court-upholds-death.php">upheld</a> [JURIST] the death sentence for a 20-year-old student who took part in anti-government protests in December. Mohammad Amin Valian was convicted of Moharebeh, which means waging war against God and is punishable by death under Iranian law. Also in March, the official Iranian press supervisory body <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iran-government-bans-reformist.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] reformist daily newspaper <a href="http://www.etemaad.ir/Released/88-12-10/default.htm">Etemaad</a> [media website, in Persian] and moderate weekly magazine <a href="http://www.irandokht.com/news/">Iran Dokht</a> [media website]. In late February, six journalists were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9E5NBFO0">released</a> [AP report] from a Tehran prison, while many others remain incarcerated for their reformist views. In February, a joint US-EU <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/eu-us-condemn-iran-human-rights.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] condemned Iranian action against protesters and other critics of government policy. The Iranian government responded strongly to opposition following June&#39;s disputed elections, prompting additional criticism from rights groups and advocacy organizations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar authorities on Thursday <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressReleaseNyiNyiAung.Released.3-18-2010pdf.pdf">released</a> [advocacy press release, PDF] jailed democracy activist <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/NYINYI.php">Nyi Nyi Aung</a> [advocacy profile], ordering him to leave the country. Aung, a US citizen, had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/myanmar-court-sentences-us-rights.php">sentenced to three years in prison</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted on <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-court-charges-us-citizen-with.php">fraud and forgery charges</a> [JURIST report] by a Myanmar court last month. Advocacy groups have <a href="/hotline/2010/01/burmese-democratic-activist-nyi-nyi.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the charges against Aung were filed because of his political advocacy, and a group of 53 members of the US <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressReleaseandHouseLetter-NyiNyiAung.10-18-09.pdf">called for his immediate release</a> [letter, PDF] following his conviction. Aung is expected to return to the US.<br /><br />Myanmar has recently faced significant criticism of its human rights record. Last week, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana released a report saying that some of the country&#39;s violations <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-myanmar-expert-says-some-government.php">may constitute war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week, Myanmar&#39;s junta <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">announced new election laws</a> [JURIST report], one of which bars pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] from participating in the upcoming elections. The move that immediately criticized by UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website], who said that the laws do <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-election-laws-do-not-meet.php">not meet international standards</a> [JURIST reports] for an inclusive political process. In January, a Myanmar government official said that Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-official-says-suu-kyi-to-be.php">released from house arrest</a> [JURIST report] in November when her sentence is scheduled to end, likely after the elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/06-360591.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] a petition by former attorney general <a href="/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">John Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive] to reconsider its decision that Ashcroft is not entitled to absolute and qualified immunity in an unlawful detention case. By declining to rehear its previous <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2009/09/04/06-36059.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ninth-circuit-rules-no-ashcroft.php">report</a>], the court is allowing the lawsuit by US citizen Abdullah al-Kidd to go forward. Ashcroft could be found personally liable for misusing the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3144.html">material witness statute</a> [18 USC &sect; 3144 text; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/materialwitnessreport.pdf">HRW backgrounder</a>, PDF]. The court was split in its decision. In the dissent, Judge O&#39;Scannlain questioned the scope of the majority&#39;s decision. He wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />By permitting al-Kidd&#39;s suit to proceed, the majority commits two distinct but equally troubling legal errors, each of which will have far-reaching implications for how government officials perform their duties. First, the majority strips Ashcroft of his official immunity, holding that it was clearly established at the time of al-Kidd&#8217;s arrest that prosecutors violate the Fourth Amendment when they obtain and execute a material witness warrant as a pretext for other law enforcement objectives. Second, by holding that Ashcroft may be personally liable if his subordinates swore false affidavits to obtain the warrant authorizing al-Kidd&#39;s arrest, the majority stretches beyond recognition the rule that a government official is liable only when he personally violates the constitution.<br /></blockquote><br />The majority opinion responded directly to the dissenting judges, rejecting their analysis and the potential ramifications from the decision. Upon learning of the court&#39;s decision, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] Immigrants&#39; Rights Project Deputy Director Lee Gelernt <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights-national-security/ashcroft-can-be-held-accountable-post-911-wrongful-detention">criticized</a> [press release] Ashcroft saying that he &quot;deliberately distorted the federal material witness law to allow the detention of innocent people. ... [H]e should be held personally liable.&quot;<br /><br />Ashcroft has faced a number of lawsuits for his actions while attorney general. In December, the US <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/second-circuit-rules-for-government-in.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that post-arrest detention is legal in cases where the detainees are reasonably detained in a case, finding Ashcroft not liable. The government had settled with <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-settles-with-post-911.php">five of the plaintiffs</a> [JURIST report] for $1.26 million in November, despite admitting no wrongdoing. Ashcroft had previously claimed absolute immunity because his actions to seek a material witness warrant were those of a &quot;prosecutor.&quot; He had claimed qualified immunity as an attorney general because his actions furthered an investigatory or national security function. In September, the Ninth Circuit rejected both of those claims, upholding a <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-us-ag-ashcroft-denied.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-remands-ashcroft-immunity.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a similar case challenging Ashcroft&#39;s immunity from lawsuits for mistreatment of prisoners could not go forward because of failure to adequately state a claim.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Retired US Marine Corps General <a href="http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Sheehan_JJ.htm">John Sheehan</a> [official profile] <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/Webcasts/2010/03%20March/03-18-10%20Webcast.htm">testified</a> [video] before the US <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] on Thursday that he believes the Dutch military&#39;s inclusion of openly gay soldiers is partially responsible for the severity of the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> massacre during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. Sheehan, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, made the remarks during a <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/e_witnesslist.cfm?id=4476">hearing</a> [materials] charged with evaluating the future of the US military&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">&quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy</a> [10 &sect; USC 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. He argued that the Netherlands and several other European countries reconfigured their militaries for less demanding peacekeeping roles after the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequently &quot;made a conscious effort to socialize their military - that includes the unionization of their militaries, it includes open homosexuality.&quot; The result, Sheehan contends, rendered their armed forces weaker and less effective. Dutch Minister of Defense <a href="http://www.defensie.nl/organisatie/minister">Eimert van Middelkoop</a> [official profile, in Dutch] called the comments <a href="http://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2010/03/19/46151051/Uitspraken_Sheehan_militair_onwaardig">&quot;utter nonsense&quot;</a> [press release, in Dutch].<br /><br />The <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/DADT_Bill.pdf">Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bill-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the Senate earlier this month, and would allow gay soldiers to serve openly if approved. The repeal of the controversial &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; policy has been an important issue for US President Barack Obama since he took office, and its inclusion in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">State of Union Address</a> [JURIST report] makes it clear that it remains a priority for the administration. In January, legal advisers for the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, suggested that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pentagon-lawyers-advise-waiting-to.php">delay any internal efforts</a> [JURIST report] to repeal the policy until 2011. In October, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to end the controversial policy. After the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-declines-to-review.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST report] to review the policy in June, the SASC <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/senate-committee-to-hold-hearings-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST reports] that it would hold hearings to review it. In 2008, more than 100 retired admirals and generals of the US military called for a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/retired-top-military-officers-call-for.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the policy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Philippine lawyers and activists protested Friday in front of the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in Manila following Wednesday&#39;s <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/march2010/191002.htm">ruling</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>], which held that the constitution does not prevent <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">profile</a>] from replacing retiring Chief Justice Reynato Puno prior to the May presidential elections. Among the activists were Philippine lawyers who used black candles to burn photos of the nine justices who ruled in favor of the decision. The right to protest is guaranteed in Article 3, Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2000317&Itemid=26">Philippine Constitution</a> [text], but a Supreme Court official warned that lawyers participating in the protests would be disbarred if they exceed the legal limits of their right to protest. The appointment of the next chief justice has political significance because Arroyo&#39;s term ends June 30, and the appointment could be used to confer a political advantage in a reelection campaign.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has previously sided with Arroyo, ruling last month that she is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">eligible to run for senate</a> [JURIST report] after her presidential term expires. The court found the law requiring appointed officials to resign when they declare their candidacy for elected office is constitutional, but that the ruling does not affect elected officials. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice (PDOJ)</a> [official website] charged 197 people with <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the November massacre in the semi-autonomous Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. Among those charged is Andal Ampatuan Sr., a former political ally to Arroyo. Following the killings, Arroyo imposed <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended habeas corpus in the province. She later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-lifts-martial-law.php">lifted the conditions</a>, following <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/rights-group-urges-philippines.php">international pressure</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/some-philippines-judges-want-high-court.php">domestic legal challenges</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The number of inmates in US state prisons has dropped for the first time in 40 years, according to a <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Prison_Count_2010.pdf?n=880">report</a> [text] released Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/">Pew Center on the States</a> [advocacy website]. Led by California and Michigan, the state prison population decreased by 0.4 percent during 2009. Because of a slight increase in the federal system, the total number of prisoners in US prisons increased slightly between in 2009. According to the report, the decline is due to fewer prisoners entering the prison system, while the number of people leaving state prison in 2008 was an all-time high. The report said that even before facing financial difficulties, many states had already started reducing total admissions in 2007, and others had cut back on parole revocations. Director of the Pew Center&#39;s <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/initiatives_detail.aspx?initiativeID=31336">Public Safety Performance Project</a> [advocacy website] Adam Gelb <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=57793">said</a> [press release] that another important reason for the decline &quot;is that states began to realize there are research-based ways they can cut their prison populations while continuing to protect public safety.&quot;<br /><br />Last year, the Pew center <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/1-in-31-us-adults-under-correctional.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that one in 31 US adults is in prison, or on parole. The report found that men are five times as likely as women to be in prison and that black adults are four times as more likely as white adults. According to the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> (BJS) [official website], 7.3 million people were under some form of correctional <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/corr2.cfm">supervision</a> [BJS statistics] in 2008. According to the <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/law/research/icps/">International Center for Prison Studies</a> [official website], the US has the most prisoners <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/icps/downloads/world-prison-pop-seventh.pdf">per capita</a> [text, PDF] in the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://ictr.org/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/cases/Bikindi/decisions/100318_apl.pdf">affirmed</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2010/635.htm">press release</a>] the genocide conviction of popular Rwandan singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/simon_bikindi_221.html">Simon Bikindi</a> [Trial Watch profile, <a href="http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/cases/Bikindi/index.htm">case materials</a>]. The charge was based on a speech Bikindi gave during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwanda genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder] in which he called on Hutus to rise up and exterminate the Tutsis. Prosecutor <a href="http://www.ictr.org/ENGLISH/factsheets/Jallow.htm">Justice Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [official profile] appealed the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Bikindi/judgement/081202eJudgement.pdf">15-year sentence</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ictr-sentences-hutu-composer-to-15.php">report</a>] given to Bikindi in January on the grounds that it was inadequate punishment for &quot;direct and public incitement to commit genocide.&quot; Bikindi appealed on the basis that the sentence was disproportionate to the gravity of the offense and that court erred in its evaluation of his association with extremist militia group, Interahamwe. The court rejected both appeals.<br /><br />The court also <a href="http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/cases/Nshamihigo/decisions/100318_apl.pdf">reversed</a> [judgment, PDF] several convictions against Rwandan district attorney <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/simeon_nchamihigo_357.html">Simeon Nchamihigo</a> [Trial Watch profile, <a href="http://ictr.org/ENGLISH/cases/Nshamihigo/index.htm">case materials</a>]. In 2008, Nchamihigo was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/former-ictr-deputy-prosecutor-sentenced.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with four counts of genocide, murder, extermination, and other crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Appeals Chamber reversed his convictions of murder as a crime against humanity, extermination as a crime against humanity, and three counts of genocide. Nchamihigo&#39;s other convictions were affirmed and his sentence was reduced to 40 years. Both Bikindi and Nchamihigo are being held in the UN Detention Facility in Arusha, Tanzania, pending their transfer to the countries where they will serve their sentences.<br /><br />Bikindi was first indicted and arrested in 2001. At the time of his arrest, Bikindi was living in the Netherlands. He fought extradition for several months but lost and was turned over to the ICTR in March 2002 where he <a href="http://www.hirondelle.org/hirondelle.nsf/caefd9edd48f5826c12564cf004f793d/4fc571f5e3e9dd55c1256a8a00006e75?OpenDocument">pleaded not guilty</a> [Hirondelle materials] to charges of genocide. His <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/rwanda-genocide-trial-for-singer.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in September 2006 following numerous delays relating to court ordered <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">amendments to the original indictment</a> [trial minutes, PDF]. Nchamihigo was taken into custody by ICTR security staff in May 2001 when he was recognized while working as an investigator for the legal team defending former Rwandan army officer Samuel Imanishimwe. Nchamihigo was working with false identity papers under the name of Bahati Weza.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Constitutional Court of <a href="http://www.republicoftogo.com/fr/home.asp">Togo</a> [official website, in French] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.togoembassy.us/index.php?view=article&catid=28:feedback&id=51:constitutional-court-release-final-presidential-vote-totals&format=pdf">affirmed</a> [Embassy press release, PDF] the election of incumbent <a href="http://www.togoembassy.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1:the-president&catid=1:staff">President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe</a> [official profile] despite five suits alleging voter fraud filed by the opposition. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jx5IJtnFN2dWJLHOatqLBSGUVoww">court held</a> [AFP report] that the accusations made by the opposition were unsubstantiated. The final vote totals decided by the court gave Gnassingbe 60.88 percent of the vote, and his main opponent, Jean-Pierre Fabre, 33.93 percent. The final results closely resembled those originally reported after the March 4 election. Fabre has rejected the court&#39;s decision and stated that he plans to hold demonstrations against the election.<br /><br />Last month, the court ruled that presidential candidate <a href="http://www.yamgnane2010.com/">Kofi Yamgnane</a> [campaign website, in French] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/togo-court-rules-opposition-candidate.php">not eligible to run</a> [JURIST report] in the election due to inconsistent records of his date of birth and conflicting immigration documents. Yamgnane asserted that the decision was a pretext to eliminate the most dangerous candidate to Gnassingbe&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.rpt.tg/index.php">Rally of the Togolese People</a> (RTP) [party website, in French] party. Gnassingbe <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/togo-revises-constitution-to-allow.php">took office</a> [JURIST report] in February 2005 immediately following the death of his father, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/830774.stm">Gnassingbe Eyadema</a> [BBC obituary], who was president of Togo for 38 years and one of the country&#39;s longest serving leaders. Gnassingbe&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/two-killed-protesting-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional succession to office</a> [JURIST report] was met with international outcry, and <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/ecowas-sanctions-imposed-as-pressure.php">pressure</a> from the <a href="http://www.ecowas.info/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] member countries led to his <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/togo-president-steps-down-african.php">resignation</a> [JURIST reports]. Togo&#39;s Parliament then named Abass Bonfoh, a member of the ruling party, as acting president. In May 2005, the constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/togo-constitutional-court-confirms.php">confirmed</a> Gnassingbe as the official <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/togo-election-commission-declares.php">winner</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/togo-opposition-leader-claims.php">disputed presidential election</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/03/20100318a.html">announced</a> [press release] a final <a href="/FDA-1995-N-0259-0002.htm">rule</a> [text] restricting tobacco sales and promotions directed at youth. The Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents are a set of broad regulations &quot;designed to significantly curb access to and the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to children and adolescents in the United States.&quot; In order to do so, the FDA said that this rule:<br /><blockquote><br />prohibits the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to people younger than 18, prohibits the sale of cigarette packages with less than 20 cigarettes, prohibits distribution of free samples of cigarettes, restricts distribution of free samples of smokeless tobacco, and prohibits tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical or other social or cultural events.<br /></blockquote><br />The FDA first began to regulate the tobacco industry in 1996, but,, in 2000 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1152.ZS.html">FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</a> [opinion text] that Congress had not provided the FDA with the authority to regulate tobacco products. The new rule, which comes 15 years after the FDA first proposed banning the sale and marketing of tobacco to youth, will go into effect June 22 as law.  <br /><br />In August, several tobacco companies <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/tobacco-companies-file-lawsuit-claiming.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1256enr.txt.pdf">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> [text, PDF] on First Amendment grounds. In June, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the act</a> into law, just two weeks after it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/congress-gives-final-approval-to.php">approved by Congress</a> [JURIST reports]. The law attempts to safeguard the public by granting the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products, among other provisions. Last year, the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/">House Energy and Commerce Committee</a> [official website] voted 38-12 to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/house-panel-approves-tobacco-regulation.php">approve the bill</a> [JURIST report]. The US Senate <a href="http://help.senate.gov/">Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-senate-panel-backs-fda-tobacco.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007. Shortly before that, the former FDA commissioner said that the FDA <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/fda-not-prepared-to-take-on-tobacco.php">lacked the resources</a> [JURIST report] to handle tobacco regulation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Hebei Province People&#39;s High Court in northern China on Wednesday <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-03/17/content_9604070.htm">upheld</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report] a life sentence for former vice president of China&#39;s <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> (SPC) [official website, in Chinese] Huang Songyou. Huang was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in January of bribery and embezzlement, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Huang is the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-01/04/content_9257706.htm">highest-ranking judge to be charged with corruption</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report] since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. Between 2005 and 2008, Huang allegedly embezzled 3.9 million yuan (about $574,000 USD) while serving as vice president of the SPC, and he allegedly embezzled 1.2 million yuan (about $175,000 USD) while serving as president of the Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Zhanjiang in 1997. <br /><br />Huang&#39;s conviction comes amid initiatives by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/ccp.htm">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] to fight corruption in the judicial system in order to restore public confidence. In March, the president of the SPC, <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/dfg/index.php?id=119">Wang Shengjun</a> [official profile, in Chinese], called for increased efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country&#39;s court system. In January, the SPC announced <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. Chinese courts are under the control of the CPC, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-to-crack-down-on-corruption.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month to increase oversight of the families of government officials to control corruption.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraq&#39;s <a href="http://www.ihec.iq/english/index.htm">Independent High Electoral Commission</a> (IHEC) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/314865,iraqi-officials-reject-european-claims-of-election-fraud.html">dismissed allegations of election fraud</a> [DPA report] from a member of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=146">European Parliament</a> [official website]. After the March 7 <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST news archive], head of the European Parliament&#39;s Delegation for Relations with Iraq, <a href="http://www.struanstevenson.com/">Struan Stevenson</a> [official website], reported that he had received a &quot;flood&quot; of complaints about election fraud. He <a href="http://www.struanstevenson.com/media/news-release/iraqi_election_-_mounting_claims_of_cheating/">said</a> [press release]:<br /><blockquote><br />The issue of fraud and ballot-rigging perpetrated by the Iranian regime and the ruling State of Law coalition is an extremely worrying situation for all political parties in Iraq. Many political leaders and officials who have participated in the elections have revealed such cheating with precise details during numerous interviews with the press and in emails to me and telephone conversations.<br /></blockquote><br />In its response, the IHEC called the fraud claims &quot;baseless,&quot; but also expressed a willingness to investigate the allegations and take corrective measures if necessary. Also, on Wednesday, the State of Law Coalition led by Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-ruling-coalition-alleges-fraud-in.php">alleged fraud</a> [JURIST report] and asked the IHEC to conduct a recount. In contrast, UN election observers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2010/0312/UN-sees-no-indication-of-widespread-fraud-in-Iraq-election">reported</a> [CSM report] that they have not seen any indicators of large-scale election fraud. <br /><br />Fraud allegations are the latest in a series of problems plaguing the parliamentary elections. Last month, an Iraqi appeals panel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-allows-28-banned.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 28 previously banned candidates could stand for election. The Responsibility and Justice Committee had initially ruled that some 500 banned candidates could stand for election despite allegations of ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder].  The decision was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once. Last year,  the Iraqi parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iraq-lawmakers-approve-amended-election.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amended version of a controversial election law after numerous delays. The new version of the law increased the number of seats in parliament from 275 to 325, with 310 of those seats allotted to Iraq&#39;s 18 provinces and the remainder reserved for Iraqis living outside the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Turkish government indicted 33 people Friday on charges of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule. The accused, some of whom include <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/admirals-face-trial-over-turkey-plot-20100320-qmjr.html">high-ranking military officials</a> [AFP report], are alleged to have plotted with a secret group called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] to assassinate prominent members of  Turkey&#39;s Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths, and seize power in the process. The plot was never carried out. A trial date is set for June 15. <br /><br />Earlier this week, Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-arrests-20-more-in.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] 20 people in connection with the alleged Ergenekon plot. Turkish prosecutors recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon and plotting to overthrow Turkey&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. In February, more than 40 military officers were arrested and charged with a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">separate plot</a> [JURIST report], the so-called <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">Sledgehammer plot</a> [JURIST report], to stage a coup by provoking a military confrontation with Greece and take advantage of the ensuing chaos. The Ergenekon investigation has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence the opposition and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">impose</a> [JURIST report] islamic principles on secular Turkey. Trials against the Ergenekon group <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">started</a> [JURIST report] two years ago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The criminal court of Evry on Thursday convicted 14 members of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=neo-nazi">neo-Nazi</a> [JURIST news archive] group Nomad 88. The defendants faced <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-court-opens-neo-nazi-trial.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] for their participation in a combat group, the illegal detention of weapons and explosives, and their responsibility in a shoot-out in 2008. The two leaders of the group, Camille Farout and Thomas Coumont, were <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2010/03/18/97001-20100318FILWWW00735-groupe-neo-nazi-12-condamnations.php">sentenced</a> [AFP report, in French] to four and three years imprisonment respectively, with partially suspended sentences, and ordered to pay damages. The other members received shorter or suspended sentences. The prosecution had demanded sanctions ranging from fines to 42 months of imprisonment. The hearing revealed that although the group was in possession of a <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/essonne-91/tribunal-d-evry-le-groupuscule-neonazi-voulait-creer-une-armee-15-03-2010-849432.php">substantial quantity of weapons</a> [<em>Le Parisien</em> report, in French] and had engaged in military training, the ideological component was far from developed. The group committed mainly hate crimes, targeting easily identifiable social groups such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Romas</a> [JURIST news archive] or immigrants. The court was told that since the start of the legal proceedings in 2008, the members had broken their ties to the neo-Nazi movement.<br /><br />Formed in 2007, the group was disbanded in mid-2008 following the arrest of two of its members involved in a shoot-out. During its existence, it formed ties with other extremist nationalist groups, such as the <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2008/06/27/01016-20080627ARTFIG00659-la-droite-ultra-dans-le-collimateur-des-rg-.php">Socialist Right</a> [<em>Le Figaro</em> profile, in French], which are still in operation today despite governmental surveillance and efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/france-seeks-ban-on-neo-nazi-groups.php">suppress the movement</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish police detained 20 people Thursday in connection with the alleged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] conspiracy to overthrow the Islamist-rooted government. Among those <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2010/03/18/world/international-uk-turkey-military.html">arrested</a> [Reuters report] are retired and active military officers, but the identities and ranks of the individuals have not been released. The arrests are part of an ongoing operation to investigate the Ergenekon conspiracy by the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], which is currently at odds with the secular-rooted military and judiciary. More than 200 people have been arrested in connection with the Ergenekon conspiracy.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Turkish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon. The AKP is also investigating another alleged coup plot, the &quot;Sledgehammer,&quot; led by high-ranking military officials. In February, Turkish <a href="http://cankaya.gov.tr/">President Abdullah Gul</a> [official website, in Turkish], Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the <a href="http://www.tsk.tr/eng/genel_konular/chief.htm">Chief of General Staff Gen. Ilker Basbug</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/dnp-turkey.php">met in Ankara</a> [JURIST report], to discuss tensions over that alleged coup plot. Hours after that meeting, a Turkish court released three high ranking military officials that had been detained for questioning. Tensions in Turkey between the military and government have harmed Turkey&#39;s bid to join the <a href="http://europa.eu">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. Turkey&#39;s secular nationalist establishment, including the <a href="http://www.tsk.tr/INDEX.html">Turkish Armed Forces</a> (TAF) [official website, in Turkish], has long been at odds with the AKP.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US citizen and Chicago resident David Headley <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/March/10-ag-277.html">pleaded guilty</a> [press release] to 12 counts of federal terrorism Thursday, including charges related to the  2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attack</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=2008+mumbai+terror">news archive</a>] and an alleged plot against the Danish creator and publishers of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon">controversial cartoons</a> [JURIST news archive] depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The government had <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2010/pr0114_01a.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] Headley of conducting surveillance in preparation for the Mumbai attack for the terrorist organization <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder], which is blamed for the attack. Headley was also charged with conspiring to bomb the headquarters of Danish newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://jp.dk/">Jyllands-Posten</a></span> [media website, in Danish], which published the cartoons. In January, Headly pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/mumbai-terror-suspects-plead-not-guilty.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges in the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website]. It is thought he changed his plea to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8576145.stm">avoid extradition</a> [BBC report] to India, Pakistan, or Denmark, or to avoid capital punishment.<br /><br />In January, an Indian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/india-court-rejects-mumbai-terror.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by the lone surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks for an international trial. Muhammad Ajmal Amir Kasab claimed he would not receive a fair trial in India. Kasab, whom India claims participated directly in the Mumbai attacks, said during his trial that he had met Headley while in jail after being arrested. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/January/10-nsd-038.html">charged</a> [press release] three men along with Headley for their <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-indicts-4-for-2008-mumbai-terror.php">role</a> [JURIST report] in the Mumbai attacks and plot against the Danish Newspaper. Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago resident with Canadian citizenship, was charged with three counts of providing material support to terrorism, one each for his alleged roles in the Denmark plan and Mumbai attacks, and a third for alleged involvement with LeT. Retired Pakistani military officer Abdur Rehman and Ilyas Kashmiri, who is believed to have ties to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], were also named in the indictment. Both face one count of conspiracy and one count of providing material support to terrorism for their alleged participation in the Danish newspaper plot. Rana is in federal custody and has pleaded not guilty, and Rehman and Kashmiri remain at-large.

Eight of the ten men charged have been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hBxopEQ_TN-YxzmB-8Kz9rI0PZew">under arrest</a> [AFP report] since November.<br /><br />Last week, an opposition official complained of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8561732.stm">frequent incidents of indefinite detention</a> [BBC report] of citizens, including government officials, without charges being filed.

The case is being <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/articles/fa_20100318_lambda-goes-back-court.html">brought</a> [press release] on behalf of six couples and the surviving partner of a seventh by <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website]. They filed a motion in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">Supreme Court of New Jersey</a> [official website] arguing that the decision handed down in 2002 in <a href="http://data.lambdalegal.org/pdf/legal/lewis/lewis-v-harris-decision.pdf">Lewis v. Harris</a> [decision text], which said same-sex couples should have &quot;full rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples,&quot; is not being followed adequately with civil unions. The plaintiffs claim that they &quot;and other committed lesbian gay partners in New Jersey live in second-class circumstances, relegated to demonstrably inferior, state-created status of civil unions.&quot; They argue that same-sex couples lack workplace benefits and protections, face unequal treatment and lack of recognition in public accommodations and civic life, and that their children are &quot;prejudiced by the unequal and inferior legal and social status&quot; of civil unions.<br /><br />In January, the New Jersey Senate voted 20-14 to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeat a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have legalized same-sex marriage in the state. The Senate Judiciary Committee had <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-jersey-senate-committee-approves.php">voted 7-6 in favor of the bill</a> [JURIST report] in December, marking the first time that any body in the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/">state legislature</a> [official website] had approved same-sex marriage legislation. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">Washington DC</a> [JURIST reports].

The plan entails four principal tenets: improving border security, creating a system through which temporary workers would be admitted, introducing biometric identification cards, and instituting a process to legalize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive] currently residing within the US. Undocumented immigrants would receive legal status upon paying back taxes and fines, submitting to background checks, completing an English proficiency examination, and performing community service. All job-seeking US citizens and legal immigrants would be issued a tamper-proof Social Security card containing biometric identification information, which potential employers would use to confirm an applicant&#39;s identity and employment eligibility. Additionally, immigrants earning an advanced science, engineering, technology, or math degree from a US institution would receive green cards. The senators underscored the need for swift action, saying:<br /><blockquote><br />Our immigration system is badly broken. Although our borders have become far more secure in recent years, too many people seeking illegal entry get through. We have no way to track whether the millions who enter the United States on valid visas each year leave when they are supposed to. And employers are burdened by a complicated system for verifying workers&#39; immigration status.<br /></blockquote><br />The proposal was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-praising-bipartisan-immigration-reform-framework">met with praise</a> [press release] from President Barack Obama, who encouraged the senators to draft corresponding legislation.<br /><br />The Office of Immigration Statistics of the US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_ill_pe_2009.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-illegal-immigrant-population.php">report</a>] in February estimating that the total number of illegal immigrants living in the US fell to 10.8 million during the year ending in January 2009, a seven percent decline from the previous year. In December, Democratic lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/democratic-lawmakers-introduce.php">introduced an immigration reform bill</a> [JURIST report] in the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] that would give undocumented immigrants an easier path to seek legal status in the country. The proposed legislation, titled the <a href="http://www.visalawyerblog.com/reform%20bill%2012-15-09.pdf">Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America&#39;s Security and Prosperity Act of 2009</a> (CIR ASAP) [bill summary, PDF], follows the Obama administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/dhs-announces-plans-for-immigration.php">announcement</a> [JURIST report] that it would seek immigration reform early in 2010. In November, DHS <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] said that the proposed reform legislation would be a &quot;three-legged stool&quot; that combines effective and fair enforcement, an improved process for legal immigration, and a &quot;firm but fair way&quot; to deal with illegal immigrants who are already in the US. The proposed bill is also the first attempt at immigration reform since the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-senate-rejects-immigration-reform.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN1639:">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill</a> [S 1639 materials] in 2007. At that time, detractors called the bill too lenient on illegal immigrants and said that by granting legal status to illegal aliens, the US was granting &quot;amnesty.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82a5b2e2-0f56-47b5-9d4f-7a12b7a3dfb9/2/doc/09-4083-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82a5b2e2-0f56-47b5-9d4f-7a12b7a3dfb9/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] must release information about loans it made to banks during April and May 2008, a key moment in the financial crisis. The information was sought by Bloomberg News under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text, PDF]. The Second Circuit affirmed a ruling by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] and rejected the Federal Reserve&#39;s argument that the records fall under <a href="http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/foia/foiaex.html">FOIA exceptions</a> [text] four and five and that the information was privileged. In rejecting the Federal Reserve&#39;s argument, the court said:<br /><blockquote><br />The Board and the Clearing House undertake to show that disclosure would harm the banks that borrowed (by disclosing their prior distress) and the banking system as a whole (because banks under stress may hesitate to seek relief or rescue), and that these harms will reduce the effectiveness of measures critical to the banking system. The arguments are plausible, and forcefully made. But a test that permits an agency to deny disclosure because the agency thinks it best to do so (or convinces a court to think so, by logic or deference) would undermine &quot;the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of [FOIA].&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />In a companion case brought by Fox News, the court <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/20c9feeb-1cc8-4b3e-9068-32c013183227/1/doc/09-3795-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/20c9feeb-1cc8-4b3e-9068-32c013183227/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Federal Reserve must disclose loan information between August 2007 and November 2008. <br /><br />Earlier this week, Senate Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-democrats-propose-new-financial.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] to increase financial regulation in light of the recent crisis. In September, banking industry regulators <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-bank-regulators-defend-efforts.php">defended themselves</a> [JURIST report] in front of the US House of Representatives <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">Financial Services Committee</a> [official website]. President Barack Obama has called for <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/obama-urges-stronger-financial-industry.php">greater oversight</a> [JURIST report] of the banking industry. In July, Obama sent draft legislation to Congress that would put the Federal Reserve <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/obama-administration-sends-financial.php">in charge</a> [JURIST report] of regulating the largest financial firms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Guatemalan criminal court ruled Wednesday that former Guatemalan president <a href="http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/guatemala/alfonso_portillo_cabrera">Alfonso Portillo</a> [CIDOB profile, in Spanish] can be extradited to the US to face charges of <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/25793647/Portillo-Money-Launder-Indictment">money laundering</a> [indictment; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January10/portilloalfonsoindictmentpr.pdf">press release</a>, PDF]. Portillo, who was president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004, has been charged in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on information provided by former members of Portillo&#39;s government. He is accused of taking $15.8 million from funds designated for the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense and siphoning it into bank accounts in Europe and Bermuda. The former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8573766.stm">maintains he is not guilty</a> [BBC report] of any of the charges.

In 2008, Portillo was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/mexico-extradites-former-guatemala.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] back to Guatemala from Mexico, where he had fled after his immunity expired along with his term in office. The extradition order was first <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/mexico-allows-extradition-of-ex.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, but Portillo challenged it until the <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/PaginaPrincipal2008.aspx">Mexican Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled against him in January 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases.php?form=rulings">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Friday rejected a proposed settlement to address the claims of people with illnesses from working on the World Trade Center (WTC) in the months following <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive]. Judge Alvin Hellerstein cited <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/20/AR2010032000676_2.html">concerns</a> [WP report] over the fairness of claim amounts and the process to determine compensation as over-complicated. In addition, the judge said that lawyer fees should be limited and paid by the WTC Captive Insurance Company rather than by the claimants. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/science/earth/12zero.html">settlement</a> [NYT report], announced last week, would have addressed more than 10,000 claims and would have awarded up to $657 million if all claimants accepted the settlement. Claimants would have been required to accept the terms of their settlement within 90 days and would have been allowed to appeal settlement amounts. Hellerstein will now require WTC Captive Insurance to consult with claimants on the settlement&#39;s terms, and he ordered judicial supervision of the claims process. The settlement will not be considered finalized until 95 percent of claimants have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/nyregion/20zero.html">approved</a> [NYT report] it. WTC Captive Insurance President Christine LaSala decried the judge&#39;s decision on what the insurer views as a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-by-wtc-captive-insurance-company-on-hearing-regarding-settlement-of-rescue-recovery-and-debris-removal-claims-88605747.html">fair settlement</a> [fact sheet], and considered that the decision would render compensating claimants <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100319-712994.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines">more difficult</a> [WSJ report].<br /><br />The WTC Captive Insurance Company is a non-profit company that was created by <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&docid=f:hj2enr.txt.pdf">Public Law 108-7</a> [text, PDF] with  $1 billion in <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) [official website] funding to provide for workers&#39; claims over sicknesses contracted from exposure at the WTC site in the months following 9/11. In 2007, the City of New York agreed to enter into <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/nyc-willing-to-discuss-settlement-in.php">settlement negotiations</a> over a <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/world-trade-center-cleanup-workers.php">federal class action lawsuit</a> filed on behalf of more than 9,000 emergency and cleanup workers who may have inhaled toxic dust at WTC site, which Hellerstein <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-permits-911-cleanup.php">allowed</a> [JURIST reports] to proceed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032210zor.pdf">declined to rule</a> [order list, PDF] in the case known as <u>Kiyemba II</u>, in which the court was asked to consider issues surrounding the transfer of <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees. Lawyers for four Chinese Muslim <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uighur+guantanamo">Uighurs</a> [JURIST news archive] detained at Guantanamo were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-seek.php">appealing</a> [JURIST report] an April <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200904/05-5487-1174543.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/dc-circuit-rules-courts-cannot-prevent.php">report</a>] by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Columbia Circuit, which held that US courts cannot prevent the government from transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries on the grounds that detainees may face prosecution or torture in the foreign country. The case is separate from a case the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-sends-uighur-case-back-to.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] to the DC circuit court earlier this month, known as <u>Kiyemba I</u>.<br /><br />Also Monday, the court granted <em>certiorari</em> in four cases. In <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-571.htm">Connick v. Thompson</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-571_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether imposing failure-to-train liability on a district attorney&#39;s office for a single <u>Brady</u> violation contravenes the rigorous culpability and causation standards or undermines prosecutors&#39; absolute immunity. Prosecutors hid exculpatory evidence in violation of defendant John Thompson&#39;s rights under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/373/83/case.html">Brady v. Maryland</a> [opinion text]. The US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Thompson-judgment-2-12-07.pdf">judgment</a> [text, PDF] in favor of Thompson, and the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Thompson-rulng-4-23-07.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] the motion for a new trial.<br /><br />In <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-658.htm">Belleque v. Moore</a> [docket, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-658_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether the standard set forth in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/499/279/case.html">Arizona v. Fulminante</a> [opinion text] - that the erroneous admission of a coerced confession at the trial is not harmless - applies if a collateral challenge is based on a defense attorney&#39;s decision not to move to suppress a confession prior to a guilty or no contest plea. If the standard applies, the court will then have to consider whether the application is &quot;clearly established&quot; under federal law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spain should <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/19/spain-end-amnesty-franco-era-atrocities">repeal its 1977 amnesty law</a> [press release] that bars investigation and prosecution of crimes committed under the Franco regime rather than &quot;prosecuting a judge seeking accountability for past abuses,&quot; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Friday. HRW called for Spain to comply with the 2008 <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/E11FCC07F3EAF5C2C12574F3004E5368?opendocument">recommendation</a> [press release] from the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] to end the amnesty law. HRW asserts that the criminal investigation and pending judicial proceedings against Spanish National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news   archive</a>] are at odds with the very principles that Garzon helped to enforce in prosecuting human rights abuses abroad. According to HRW Americas director Jose Manuel Vivanco, &quot;Spanish courts have routinely failed to investigate allegations of  horrendous crimes of the past, but are being surprisingly active in prosecuting a judge who tried to push for accountability.&quot;<br /><br />Garzon is under judicial scrutiny for <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordering  an investigation</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008 in response to a complaint by the <a href="http://www.memoriahistorica.org/">Organization for  Restoring Historical Memory</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish] that the Franco regime carried out systematic killings and enforced disappearances of opponents. Last month, a Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] judge rejected Garzon&#39;s motion to dismiss the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201002/04/espana/20100204elpepunac_4_Pes_PDF.doc">complaint</a> [text in Spanish, DOC] originally lodged by <a href="http://www.manoslimpias.es/">Manos Limpias</a> [advocacy website], a far-right leaning advocacy organization. The judge ruled that Garzon may have exceeded his jurisdictional authority when he launched an <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into war crimes allegedly committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a>  [BBC backgrounder] and during the <a href="http://unx1.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/SpanCW.html">Spanish Civil War</a> [LOC backgrounder]. Garzon maintains that he acted within the bounds of the law, basing his jurisdiction determination on the National Court&#39;s competence over crimes against the government and high authorities of the state. Garzon has <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201003/05/espana/20100305elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">petitioned</a> [text in Spanish, PDF; <span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Garzon/pide/Poder/Judicial/le/suspenda/recusa/vocales/elpepuesp/20100305elpepunac_15/Tes">report</a>, in Spanish] the Spanish Supreme Court to allow him to continue in his duties during the investigation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bolivian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3203752.stm">President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile] on Monday called on the UN to declare access to safe drinking water a basic human right, marking <a href="http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/flashindex.html">World Water Day</a> [official website]. While addressing the UN General Assembly&#39;s High Level Interactive Dialogue on Water, UN Deputy Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/deputysg.shtml">Asha-Rose Migiro</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/dsgsm496.doc.htm">reiterated the importance</a> [press release] of access to clean water resources as &quot;vital for economic growth&quot; and &quot;central to public health, food security and stable societies,&quot; but fell short of declaring it a basic human right. Migiro also stressed that continuing climate change will only make the problem harder to address. Director General of the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/">UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) [official website] Irina Bokova  also <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001872/187217e.pdf">released a statement</a> [press release, PDF] saying &quot;water must be clean, it must stay clean and, most importantly, it must be accessible to all.&quot; Morales&#39;s administration has been <a href="http://news.brunei.fm/2010/03/23/bolivia-celebrates-world-water-day-with-call-for-rational-use/">working to increase access</a> [NNN-Prensa Latina report] for Bolivian citizens to clean water since 2006, investing in new water and sewage systems throughout the country.<br /><br />Morales has also been an advocate of other environmental reform. Disappointed in the outcome of the recent <a href="http://en.cop15.dk/frontpage">UN Climate Change Conference</a> (COP15) [official website] in Copenhagen, Denmark, Bolivia is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2010/mar/19/bolivia-conference-on-climate-change">hosting an international meeting on climate change</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] next month, one week after the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCC) [official website] is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-climate-change-talks-to-resume-in.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] to hold another round of formal climate talks. While <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/no-legally-binding-agreement-on-climate.php">no legally-binding agreement was reached</a> [JURIST report] at the conclusion of the COP15 in December, 192 UN member countries agreed to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33305&Cr=Copenhagen&Cr1=">&quot;take note&quot;</a> [press release] of a non-binding <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33305&Cr=Copenhagen&Cr1=">Copenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF] developed by leaders from the US, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa in an effort to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. The Copenhagen Green Climate Fund was also established to assist poor nations in reducing the effects of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=climate+change+">climate change</a> [JURIST news archive]. The accord creates annexes by which countries will pledge to attain national emission reductions by 2020, but the pledges are not binding. Critics of the Copenhagen Accord have said it lacks the enforcement mechanisms needed to ensure compliance, and that it is unlikely to limit global temperature rise to the indicated levels.

The <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ad3/">Third Judicial Department Appellate Division</a> [official website] reversed a 2008 <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/4jd/schenectady/index.shtml">Schenectady County Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision, citing multiple protections New York affords to same-sex partnerships as sufficient to establish competency despite the state lacking its own civil union law:<blockquote>Here, while New York has not created a specific mechanism for dissolution of a civil union validly entered into in another state, neither has it exercised its power, by statute or other legislative enactment, to prohibit an action for dissolution of a civil union. Since Supreme Court&#39;s jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action has not been proscribed, and this matter involves a dispute for which &quot;adequate relief by means of an existing form of action is [un]available to the plaintiff,&quot; Supreme Court is competent to adjudicate the case.</blockquote>The case involved a same-sex New York couple that that entered into a civil union in Vermont.  Vermont, however, was unable to provide relief since it requires at least one party to be a resident of the state for at least one year.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/">New York Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=+A07732%09%09&Text=Y">legislation</a> [text; <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A07732">materials</a>] in December that would have legalized <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Turkish government on Monday unveiled a controversial new reform bill proposing <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/media/www/Anayasa%20teklif%20metni.pdf">amendments</a> [text, PDF; in Turkish] to 22 articles of the Turkish Constitution in hopes of making the government more democratic and strengthening the country&#39;s bid to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">join the European Union</a> (EU) [admission criteria]. The proposed amendments cover a <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=government-unveils-controversial-package-2010-03-22">wide range of issues</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report], including the judicial system, women&#39;s rights, and collective bargaining for civil servants. The major reforms proposed include an amendment that would make party closures more difficult and an amendment to restructure the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HYSK) and the <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/">Constitutional Court</a> [official websites, in Turkish]. Also included is an amendment to Article 15, which bans the prosecution of the 1980 coup leaders. The reform movement, led by Turkey&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], has been challenged by the opposition party Republican People&#39;s Party (CHP). The bill will now go before Parliament, where it must be approved by two-thirds of the 550 members to become law. <br /><br />Earlier this month, Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-pm-to-unveil-constitutional.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the reform package with proposed constitutional changes would be submitted the EU by the end of March, following a meeting of the EU Reform Watch Group. The Watch Group, overseen by <a href="http://www.egemenbagis.com/index.cfm">Minister and Chief EU Negotiator Egemen Bagis</a> [official profile], was created to guide Turkey&#39;s accession to the EU. Turkey has faced several obstacles as it works toward membership in the EU, including its human rights record, its stance towards political parties, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=turkish+coup">tension</a> [JURIST news archive] between the AKP and the military. Last year, the Constitutional Court of Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/turkish-constitutional-court-bans-pro.php">voted to ban</a> [JURIST report] the Democratic Society Party (DTP) after finding the party had contacts with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pkk.htm">Kurdish Workers Party</a> (PKK) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a separatist, designated terrorist group.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kazakhstan&#39;s government is <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/kazakhstani-authorities-must-tackle-police-brutality-2010-03-22">failing to curb torture</a> [press release] by law enforcement officers, according a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR57/001/2010/en/88639715-0122-4cdd-ab15-9583ec80f30d/eur570012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Monday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The report, which tracks Kazakhstan&#39;s progress in the area of human rights from the period of its adoption of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention Against Torture</a> [text], is critical of several practices that seem to run counter to the goals of that convention. Under <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR57/001/2009/en/448e0d53-1c7d-4162-90b0-4a4b43e3b044/eur570012009eng.html">Kazakh law</a> [AI report], all detentions must be registered within a three-hour time period in order to keep a suspect in pre-trial detention. AI claims that this law is rarely enforced, and most torture allegations arise from the practice of unacknowledged detentions. AI also expressed concern about the scorecard nature of assessing judges, which places pressure on judges to maintain a high conviction rate and makes them less likely to acquit or order greater investigation of allegations of torture. According to the report:<br /><blockquote><br />despite the good intentions shown by the measures noted above and the extensive education, reform and training programmes for law enforcement forces and the judiciary often run in conjunction and in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international governmental organizations (IGOs), it has become evident that torture or other ill-treatment of individuals deprived of their liberty, whether formally detained or in de facto unacknowledged detention, continue to be routinely used.<br /></blockquote><br />The report concluded with a series of recommendations, including the formation of an independent agency to assess allegations of abuse at the hands of police.<br /><br />Kazakhstan has come under increased scrutiny as the first former Soviet republic to chair the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website], a role it assumed at the beginning of 2010. In February, Kazakh NGOs <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flib.ohchr.org%2FHRBodies%2FUPR%2FDocuments%2FSession7%2FKZ%2FJS2_UPR_KAZ_S07_2010_JointSubmission2.pdf&ei=O5enS_S2Bo6Qtgfkx_nTAg&usg=AFQjCNHdiEwJp4EBFxRFi7C7AcbXpZ9UkA&sig2=NaM1kJBMnH4-OD_66UXfmw">asked</a> [submission, PDF] the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to address instances of torture and the use unlawful evidence obtained through torture during trial. In August, <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] condemned a Kazakh high court decision <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/kazahkstan-high-court-upholds-state.php">upholding the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of a journalist charged with publishing state secrets. In December, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the former Soviet nation is <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/kazakhstan-falling-short-on-reforming.php">falling short</a> [JURIST report] on reforms promised in advance of their assumption of the OSCE chairmanship.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nepalese rights groups on Sunday <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/resources/Documents/English/pressreleases/Year%202010/March/2010_03_23_PR_NHRC_NDC_OHCHR_Baitadi_E.pdf">praised</a> [press release, PDF] two recent judgments by the District Court in Baitadi against caste-based discrimination. Earlier this month, the court sentenced a man accused of assaulting the father of the groom during a July 2009 wedding for practicing &quot;rituals reserved for high-caste communities&quot; to one year in prison and a fine of 5,000 rupees. In a similar decision upheld by the Kanchanpur Appellate Court in August, the Baitadi District Court sentenced the main defendant accused of physically assaulting 12 Dalits during a festival to two years imprisonment and a fine of 25,000 rupees. Article 14 of the <a href="http://www.unmin.org.np/downloads/keydocs/Interim.Constitution.Bilingual.UNDP.pdf">Interim Constitution of Nepal</a> [text, PDF] prohibits racial discrimination on the basis of caste and sets grounds for punishment, entitling victims to compensation. The court cited the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [text] and stated that caste supremacy discrimination is &quot;morally unacceptable, socially unjust and dangerous.&quot; The UN human rights office in Nepal called the judgments an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34142&Cr=nepal&Cr1=human+rights">important step</a> [UN News Centre report] in Nepal&#39;s fight against discrimination. The <a href="http://www.ndc.gov.np/">National Dalit Commission</a> (NDC), the <a href="http://www.nhrcnepal.org/">National Human Rights Commission</a> (NHRC), and the UN <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/index.html">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal</a> (OHCHR-Nepal) [official websites], urged authorities to enforce both sentences and promote awareness of caste-based discrimination.<br /><br />In addition to caste-based discrimination, Nepal has a history of human rights abuses stemming from the country&#39;s internal conflict. Last year, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Navi+Pillay">news archive</a>] said the peace process in Nepal <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-nepal-peace.php">could be hampered</a> [JURIST report] by &quot;impunity for human rights abuses,&quot; citing the failure of Nepal&#39;s commissions on disappearances and truth and reconciliation to ensure justice for victims of abuse committed during the country&#39;s civil war. The decade-long Maoist guerrilla insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006 when the Nepalese government signed a peace agreement that established the Nepalese <a href="http://www.nepalcaportal.org/EN/">Constituent Assembly</a> (CA) [official website]. The CA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/former-maoist-rebels-lead-vote-count.php">elected</a> in April of 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-constituent-assembly-abolishes.php">voted to abolish the monarchy</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attorneys general from several states said Monday that they plan to file lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h3590eas.txt.pdf">health care reform bill</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-passes-health-care-reform.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] Sunday by the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website]. Attorneys general from at least 12 states - Florida, South Carolina, Alabama, Nebraska, Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Washington, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia - plan to file challenges after President Barack Obama signs the bill into law. Virginia plans to file a separate lawsuit from the single lawsuit to be brought by the other states. At issue in the lawsuits is the power of Congress to require individuals to purchase insurance. Congress has the power under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Article I, Section 8</a> [text] of the US Constitution to regulate interstate commerce, and the states have decided to challenge this power&#39;s application to health care legislation. Obama is scheduled to sign the bill on Tuesday.<br /><br />Last week, Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor CL &quot;Butch&quot; Otter</a> (R) [official website] became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">first governor to sign</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2010/H0391.htm">bill</a> [H 391 text] into state law banning any federal mandate for individuals to have health insurance. The Idaho Health Freedom Act orders the state attorney general to file a lawsuit against the national government over any law making health insurance mandatory. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://legis.state.va.us/">Virginia General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB10S1+pdf">similar bill</a> [text, PDF]. The bill, called the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, says that no individual shall be held liable if they refuse to sign up for health care. <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Robert McDonnell</a> (R) [official website] has said that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">sign</a> [WTVR report] the bill into law. About 30 other states are working on similar measures to <a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=ALEC_s_Freedom_of_Choice_in_Health_Care_Act">negate</a> [ALEC report] the federal mandate for health insurance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human rights groups including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>, and <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy websites] on Monday joined with members of British parliament in calling for an inquiry into the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=UK+torture">UK role in torture</a> [JURIST news archive] and rendition during the war on terror. In an <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_view/230-open-letter-from-the-appg-and-ngos-calling-for-an-inquiry?tmpl=component&format=raw">open letter</a> [text, PDF], the <a href="http://extraordinaryrendition.org/">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> [official website] demanded British officials conduct a public hearing on the role played by UK intelligence agencies and armed forces in the alleged torture and rendition of terror suspects. In the letter, the group suggests a lack of governmental transparency on the issue, saying &quot;[t]he public should not have to rely on occasional speeches and lengthy judicial cases to discover the truth about such a serious issue.&quot;<br /><br />The letter comes days after British <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] failed to deliver a promised public <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uk-to-publish-detainee-interrogation.php">revision of guidelines</a> [JURIST report] given to UK intelligence officers for the treatment of detainees. Brown faces growing scrutiny of UK detainee procedures amid allegations from former <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=binyam+mohamed">news archive</a>] that British intelligence officials were involved in his torture in Morocco. In February, Reprieve <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-rights-group-suing-government-over.php">initiated a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the UK government over its alleged torture of detainees, claiming that its unwillingness to disclose detainee policies suggests that they permit illegal torture.

Despite the <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/index/03-1189.htm">demands for a recount</a> [statement, in Arabic] Saturday by <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">profile</a>], which described the recount as necessary &quot;to preserve political stability and stave off ... the resurgence of violence,&quot; an <a href="http://www.ihec.iq/english/index.htm">Independent High Election Commission</a> (IHEC) [official website] official <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8578750.stm">stated</a> [BBC report] that a total recount of the ballots would not be feasible, and is not necessary, due to checks against fraud. Calls for a recount come amid a close election result between Maliki&#39;s Shi&#39;ite dominated <a href="http://qanoon337.org/en/">State of Law</a> [official website] coalition, and their primary rival, former prime minister <a href="http://www.ayadallawi.com/">Iyad Allawi</a> [official website, in Arabic; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/2010329495420860.html">profile</a>] and his cross-sectarian Iraqiya coalition. With 95 percent of the vote counted on Sunday, Allawi <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62J0Y820100321">maintained a lead</a> [Reuters report] of around 11,000 votes over Maliki, with the full vote count to be announced Friday. In response to the recount demands, an Iraqiya spokesperson <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/03/2010321842590736.html">stated</a> [Al Jazeera report] that a recount would delay the election results for months, negatively affecting the security situation. The close election result has prompted observers to predict that neither party will gain a majority of the 325-seat parliament, leading to possibly months of negotiations to form a government. Also on Sunday, a protest broke out in support of Maliki&#39;s recount demands in the city of Najaf, where 300 demonstrators gathered near the provincial government building.<br /><br />The IHEC on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-election-commission-rejects.php">dismissed allegations of election fraud</a> [JURIST report] from a member of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=146">European Parliament</a> [official website]. On Wednesday, The State of Law coalition first <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-ruling-coalition-alleges-fraud-in.php">asked the IHEC for a recount</a> [JURIST report], alleging fraud. State of Law spokesperson Ali Al Adib <a href="http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=24936">claimed that the ballots were manipulated</a> [AP report] by the manager of an electronic counting center who is allegedly linked to Iraqiya. The allegations came after Iraqiya <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/03/20103179262644270.html">began to take a slight lead</a> [Al Jazeera report] in a partial vote count released earlier this week. The IHEC <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9EFUT100">said that there was no evidence</a> [AP report] to back up the allegations. The fraud allegations are the latest in a series of problems plaguing the elections. Last month, an Iraqi appeals panel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-allows-28-banned.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 28 of the 500 candidates previously banned due to allegations of ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder] could stand in the election. The initial ban was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.bd/index.php?lang=en">Bangladesh Cabinet</a> [official website] on Monday ratified the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website].

However, ratification of the statute requires countries to update their own laws to reflect the provisions of the statute. Bangladesh&#39;s 1971 war crimes trials will take place under the recently amended <a href="http://bdlaws.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?act_name=&vol=&id=435">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973</a> [text].<br /><br />Last month, the Bangladeshi government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/bangladesh-to-appoint-prosecutors-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the prosecutors and investigators for the country&#39;s war crimes tribunal should be appointed in March. The tribunal will be used to conduct fair and transparent trials for those accused of war crimes during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. In July, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [BBC profile] to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/bangladesh-urged-to-improve-war-crimes.php">improve war crimes laws</a> [JURIST report] to bring justice to victims of the 1971 war.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032210zor.pdf">declined to review</a> [order list; PDF] a case involving a Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-120e.5.htm">law</a> [text] prohibiting people from protesting directly outside of <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] clinics. Lawyers for the petitioners, parties &quot;who regularly engage in pro-life counseling&quot; outside clinics, were appealing a July <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/08-2310P-01A.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/first-circuit-upholds-law-requiring.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website], which held that the law, which creates a 35-foot buffer zone around entrances and exits of reproductive health clinics, was a reasonable response to a significant threat to public safety. Opponents of the law say that it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/22/AR2010032201256.html">violates freedom of speech</a> [AP report] while supporters say that it is necessary to ensure public safety and access to abortion clinics. The justices did not comment on the reason for denying <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span>, but the court may have found it unnecessary to review the law, as the Court upheld a lower court injunction that included several similar restrictions in 1994 in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1993/1993_93_880">Madsen v. Women&#39;s Health Center</a> [Oyez backgrounder].<br /><br />Threats against abortion clinics and employees have been a longstanding concern, and the US courts of appeal have come to differing conclusions on the constitutionality of &quot;buffer zone&quot; laws meant to protect clinic patients and employees. In November, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-strikes-down-abortion.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a City of Pittsburgh <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/city_clerk/assets/ordinances/2005/05-Ord49.pdf">ordinance</a> [text, PDF] that created a layered zone structure to prevent protesters from gathering outside abortion facilities. US <a href="http://www.doj.gov/ag">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> enlisted the US <a href="http://www.usmarshals.gov/">Marshall Service</a> [official websites] last June to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/doj-increases-federal-protection-at.php">increase protection</a> [JURIST report] for at-risk people and facilities following the shooting of abortion doctor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8077021.stm">George Tiller</a> [BBC profile]. Last year, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ninth-circuit-upholds-right-to-display.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the First Amendment protected an anti-abortion group&#39;s right to display graphic pictures of early-term aborted fetuses outside of a California middle school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-22-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-998.pdf">Hamilton, Chapter 13 Trustee v. Lanning</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-adds-3-business-related.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether, in calculating a debtor&#39;s &quot;projected disposable income,&quot; a bankruptcy court may consider evidence suggesting that the debtor&#39;s income or expenses will differ from her prior income or expenses. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08-998_ca10.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that a debtor&#39;s current monthly income is the appropriate income to use in this analysis. Counsel for the petitioner, the bankruptcy trustee, argued:<br /><blockquote><br />The Tenth Circuit and Stephanie Lanning were wrong in ignoring the new Chapter 13 means test contained in the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code. The amendments to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code were intended to reduce judicial discretion by inserting a formula rather than the judicial discretion that had previously been accorded to judges and to the litigants.<br /></blockquote><br />Counsel for the debtor argued that, &quot;the word &quot;projected&quot; tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that amount of money&#39;s going to be.&quot; Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the respondent.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-223.pdf">Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc.</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether a challenge to state tax exemptions can occur in federal court when the suit does not involve the challenger&#39;s own tax assessment, but rather others that are similarly situated. The court will review whether the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t26t28+3101+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2828%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%281341%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Tax Injunction Act</a> [28 USC &sect; 1341] or comity principles bar federal court jurisdiction. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/09-223_ca6.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court&#39;s decision, which granted a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court found that neither the Tax Injunction Act nor the general principles of comity barred the plaintiff&#39;s claim. Counsel for the petitioner, Ohio Tax Commissioner Richard Levin, argued:<br /><blockquote><br />Respondents are natural gas suppliers who object to the way Ohio taxes them. Their suit belongs in State court rather than Federal court for two independent reasons. First, principles of comity and federalism dictate that the State court should resolve challenges to the validity of their own tax laws. And second, the Tax Injunction Act squarely prohibits Federal courts from issuing declaratory judgments holding State tax laws unconstitutional.<br /></blockquote><br />Counsel for Commerce Energy argued that federal courts have jurisdiction over the claim.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank &quot;illegal,&quot; during a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8577633.stm">press conference</a> [BBC report] Saturday. The statement comes two weeks after Israel <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155639.html">announced</a> [Haaretz report] the construction of 1,600 new housing units in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/jerusalem.htm">East Jerusalem</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], where Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state. Ban said:<br /><blockquote><br />The world has condemned Israel&#39;s settlement expansion plans in East Jerusalem. Let us be clear, all settlement activities [are] illegal anywhere in Occupied Territory, the Quartet has reaffirmed that position. I&#39;m also concerned about actions in Hebron, Jerusalem, and Israel. I urge all parties to respect sensitives and promote calm. We can and must find a way for Jerusalem to emerge from negotiations as the capital of two states with arrangements for holy sites acceptable to all.<br /></blockquote><br />During the press conference, in which Ban was joined by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757273.stm">Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad</a> [BBC profile], Ban <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/world/middleeast/21nations.html?scp=1&sq=ban%20ki%20moon&st=cse">voiced his support</a> [NYT report] for Fayyad&#39;s plans to build the institutions of an independent state by 2011, and called for the immediate resumption of peace talks to result in an independent Palestinian state within two years, echoing a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sg2158.doc.htm">statement</a> [text] released by the Quartet on the Middle East Friday. The Quartet, a group comprising the US, European Union, UN, and Russia, dedicated to mediating the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, urged the Israeli government to &quot;freeze all settlement activity ... and to refrain from demolitions and evictions in East Jerusalem.&quot; On Sunday, <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/21/AR2010032100148.html">stated</a> [WP report] that construction in East Jerusalem would not be restricted despite international criticism and pressure from the US. <br /><br />Two weeks ago, indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinians were <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/03/201031023521904316.html">postponed</a> [Al Jazeera report] after the <a href="http://www.moin.gov.il/">Israeli Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in Hebrew] announced the construction of 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem. The announcement coincided with a visit by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice-president-biden">US Vice President Joe Biden</a> [official profile] to promote the talks, touching off a diplomatic row between the two nations. Israeli activity in the West Bank has remained a controversial issue, and has been deemed to violate international law on several occasions. In June 2008, Ban asserted that Israeli <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">plans to expand settlements</a> [Haaretz report] in the West Bank <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">violated international law</a> [JURIST report]. Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories were <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf">held to be illegal</a> [opinion text, PDF] under international law by the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] in 2004. Shortly after construction of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel+fence">border wall</a> [JURIST news archive] began in the West Bank in 2002, the ICJ held that it also <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/131/1671.pdf">violated international law</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/report-accuses-israel-of-excluding.php">report</a>], amounting to a &quot;de facto annexation.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A German court on Tuesday sentenced former Nazi SS member Heinrich Boere to life in prison for the 1944 murders of three Dutch civilians. Boere&#39;s trial began in October after he was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/germany-appeals-court-rules-accused.php">declared medically fit to stand trial.</a> [JURIST report] During the trial, Boere <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8582449.stm">admitted to the reprisal killings</a> [BBC report] of a bicycle shop owner, a pharmacist, and a civilian member of the Dutch resistance, which he carried out as part of a SS death squad. Boere was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jNH8N4Jq2eDnM_OWtMXTY0u9GK9gD9EK9S680">sentenced to death</a> [AP report] <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span> by a Dutch court in 1949, but the sentence was later commuted to life in prison. Boere never served his sentence, as one German court refused to extradite him because of the probability that he was a German national, and another refused the request that he serve his sentence in a German jail due to the likelihood the trial was unfair because Boere was not present for the proceedings. Boere plans to appeal the court&#39;s decision and will not begin serving his sentence until the appellate process is finished.<br /><br />In November, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of accused Nazi war criminal <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>], marking the first time a Nazi war crimes trial will focus on a low-ranking foreigner rather than a commander. The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk faces 27,900 accessory accounts stemming from his alleged involvement as a guard at <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor</a> [Death Camps backgrounder] concentration camp. In August, a German district court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-court-convicts-nazi-officer-of.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Nazi army officer Josef Scheungraber to life in prison for the 1944 reprisal killing of 10 Italian civilians. Scheungraber was convicted on 10 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for ordering soldiers to blow up a barn in Falzano di Cortona, Tuscany, after forcing 11 civilians inside.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032210zor.pdf">declined to reconsider</a> [order list, PDF] a petition filed by former Panamanian military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">General Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>] to stop his extradition to France on money laundering charges. Noriega&#39;s lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> last month after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January. Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented from the original denial of <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span>, arguing that the court should use the opportunity to resolve confusion over its decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush </a>[opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] granting federal courts the power to review <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petitions brought by &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;<br /><br />Last April, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/eleventh-circuit-upholds-noriega.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Noriega&#39;s claim was precluded by &sect; 5 of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commission Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], which the government argued &quot;codifie[d] the principle that the Geneva Conventions [a]re not judicially enforceable by private parties.&quot; Noriega was challenging a district court&#39;s August 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that allows him to be extradited to France. He is wanted in France on charges of money laundering through French banks. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail in 1999, but France has agreed to hold a new trial if he is extradited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs</a> [official website] on Monday voted 13-10 in favor of the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/ChairmansMark31510AYO10306_xmlFinancialReformLegislationBill.pdf">Restoring  American Financial Stability Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/FinancialReformSummary231510FINAL.pdf">summary</a>, PDF], aimed at increasing oversight of the American financial system in the wake of the recent economic crisis. The vote on the legislative initiative, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-democrats-propose-new-financial.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] by Senate Democrats earlier this month, was split along party lines, with all Republican members voting against the proposed legislation but <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/quick-committee-vote-expected-on-financial-bill/">declining to negotiate</a> [NYT report] in committee despite the 401 amendments that had been filed. The bill includes proposals for creating consumer protection entities with oversight over consumer lending, complex companies, and the insurance industries; increased regulation for financial instruments, banking, and corporate governance; and new rules to strengthen accountability in applying financial regulation. Two prominent features of the bill are the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/volcker-rule-financial-institutions">Volcker Rule</a> [WH materials] prohibiting banks from engaging in financial activities for profit where the funds do not benefit the banks&#39; customers, and an initiative that gives the government power to break up financial institutions deemed &quot;too big to fail.&quot; Ranking Republican senator <a href="http://shelby.senate.gov/public/">Richard Shelby</a> [official website] <a href="http://shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=639cd747-802a-23ad-4a80-c8414b1fe80a">decried</a> [statement] such an early vote, saying that &quot;[f]orcing the Banking Committee to vote on this proposal in a single week is unrealistic and undercuts the potential for bipartisan  agreement given the length and complexity of the bill.&quot; Senate voting on the bill is expected to be a protracted process until a version to which both Democrats and Republicans will agree is reached.<br /><br />In December, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] to create a consumer financial protection agency. The <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved the bill</a> in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving the Obama administration&#39;s stated goal of tightening financial industry  regulations. In June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory  reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system. In 2009, the first <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf">legislative proposal</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">report</a>] to reform the financial system since the 2008 economic crisis was met with resistance and resulted in the committee&#39;s development of the current bill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Sunday voted <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml">219 - 212</a> [roll call] to approve a health care reform bill passed by the Senate in December, sending it to President Barack Obama for final approval. The bill, <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h3590eas.txt.pdf">HR 3590</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">materials</a>] was passed after two hours of debate Sunday evening, gaining no Republican support. The bill&#39;s passage was quickly followed by the passage of a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4872rh.txt.pdf">second bill</a> [HR 4872 text, PDF; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4872:">materials</a>] by a margin of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll167.xml">220 - 211</a> [roll call], which is aimed at reconciling the Senate bill with that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/house-passes-landmark-health-care.php">passed by the House</a> in November and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-unveils-proposal-to-reconcile.php">proposal released by the White House</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this month. The reconciliation bill is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/22/health.care.main/index.html">expected to be passed</a> [CNN report] by Senate Democrats using the <a href="http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/crsbackground/byrdrule.html">budget reconciliation</a> [Senate backgrounder] process to bypass a Republican filibuster. Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/03/22/what-change-looks">said</a> [transcript] that the bill represents a &quot;victory for the American people&quot;:<br /><blockquote><br />[T]oday&#39;s vote answers the prayers of every American who has hoped deeply for something to be done about a health care system that works for insurance companies, but not for ordinary people. For most Americans, this debate has never been about abstractions, the fight between right and left, Republican and Democrat - it&#39;s always been about something far more personal. ... They are why we committed ourselves to this cause. ... [The vote is] a victory for common sense.<br /></blockquote><br />During floor debate Sunday, <a href="http://www.johnboehner.house.gov/">House Minority Leader John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] <a href="http://www.johnboehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=177587">urged defeat</a> [transcript] of the bill, saying that it is &quot;not what the American people need.&quot; <br /><blockquote><br />Today we stand here amidst the wreckage of what was once the respect and honor that this House was held in by our fellow citizens. ... We have failed to listen to America. And we have failed to reflect the will of our constituents. ... In this economy, with this unemployment, with our desperate need for jobs and economic growth, is this really the time to raise taxes, to create bureaucracies, and burden every job creator in our land.<br /></blockquote><br />The bill&#39;s passage comes as the climax to over a year of debate in Congress, and is a centerpiece of Obama&#39;s domestic agenda. According to an <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/113xx/doc11379/Manager'sAmendmenttoReconciliationProposal.pdf">analysis</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO) [official website], the reconciliation bill will extend coverage to 32 million uninsured, at a cost of $940 billion over a decade, and will reduce the federal deficit by $138 billion over the same period and $1.2 trillion in the following decade. Boehner <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589643,00.html">disputes</a> [FOX News report] these figures, saying that the CBO scoring process is predicated on a &quot;fallacy.&quot;<br /><br />The Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] its version of the health care reform bill in December in a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00396">60-39 vote</a> [roll call] that split down party lines. Senate Republicans vowed to continue to fight to amend the bill, arguing that it is too expensive and would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/25/health/policy/25health.html?_r=2&hp">violate personal rights</a> [NYT report] by compelling people to buy health insurance. The House of Representatives approved its initial version of the legislation in November. Last week, Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor CL &quot;Butch&quot; Otter</a> (R) [official website] became the first governor to sign a <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2010/H0391.htm">bill</a> [H 391 text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">report</a>] into state law banning any federal mandate for individuals to have health insurance. The Idaho Health Freedom Act orders the state attorney general to file a lawsuit against the national government over any law making health insurance mandatory. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://legis.state.va.us/">Virginia General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?101+ful+HB10S1+pdf">passed a similar bill</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">report</a>]. The bill, called the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, says that no individual shall be held liable if they refuse to sign up for health care. <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Robert McDonnell</a> (R) [official website] has said that he will <a href="http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-va-lawmakers-say-no-to-health-care,0,575310.story">sign</a> [WTVR report] the bill into law. About 30 other states are working on similar measures to <a href="http://www.alec.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=ALEC_s_Freedom_of_Choice_in_Health_Care_Act">negate</a> [ALEC report] the federal mandate for health insurance.

Espinosa</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>] that a bankruptcy court can discharge a student loan debt even if the student has not filed a claim of &quot;undue hardship&quot; under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_00000523----000-.html">11 USC &sect; 523</a> [text]. The ruling affirms a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/10/01/0616421.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that student loans can be discharged within a Chapter 13 plan if the creditor receives notice of the plan and fails to object. Writing for the court, Justice Clarence Thomas said:<br /><blockquote><br />Where, as here, a party is notified of a plan&#39;s contents and fails to object to confirmation of the plan before the time for appeal expires, that party has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and the party&#39;s failure to avail itself of that opportunity will not justify ... relief. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals that the Bankruptcy Court&#39;s confirmation order is not void.<br /></blockquote><br />The ruling resolves a circuit split on the issue.<br /><br />The Supreme Court has recently taken up several bankruptcy issues. On Monday, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-998.pdf">Hamilton, Chapter 13 Trustee v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Tuesday urged government officials in El Salvador to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/el-salvador-urged-repeal-amnesty-law-2010-03-23">repeal</a> [press release] a 1993 amnesty law that <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/el-salvador-defends-amnesty-laws.php">prevents any investigation</a> [JURIST report] into killings committed during the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], including the killing of respected Catholic Archbishop <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4376733.stm">Oscar Romero</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=oscar+romero">news archive</a>]. AI also urged officials to cooperate with any investigation into the prosecution of those who committed criminal acts during the conflict. No offenders have been brought to justice for any crimes committed during the war. AI deputy director Kerrie Howard recommended the law be immediately repealed:<br /><blockquote><br />It is unacceptable that those responsible for thousands of disappearances, killings and torture have not been held to account for their crimes. The Amnesty law must be urgently repealed and full investigations, initiated.<br /></blockquote><br />Wednesday marks the thirtieth anniversary of Romero&#39;s death.<br /><br />In November, El Salvador government officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/el-salvador-government-agrees-to-open.php">agreed to a state investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of Romero, nearly a decade after the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website] first recommended an inquiry into the murder. Romero was assassinated by a death squad while saying mass in San Salvador. An outspoken critic of the military junta, his death is viewed as one of the catalysts of the war, which left more than 70,000 people dead. In 2004, a US federal court <a href="http://cja.org/section.php?id=77">held Alvaro Saravia liable</a> [CJA case backgrounder] for Romero&#39;s murder and ordered him to pay $10 million in damages to the archbishop&#39;s family. While other <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">suits have been brought</a> [JURIST report] against former Salvadoran state agents in US courts, human rights groups contend that the <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39625">amnesty laws</a> [ISP report] have undermined the rule of law and led to impunity in El Salvador. Other Latin American countries have recently overturned similar amnesty laws including <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-high-court-overturns-amnesty.php">Uruguay</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">Argentina</a> [JURIST reports].

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1553.pdf">Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha v. Regal-Beloit Corporation</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-to-hear-uighur-guantanamo.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t49t50+306+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2849%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%2811706%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887</a> [49 USC &sect; 11706] applies to the inland rail transportation of goods in the US that originate out of the country when the shipment involved an extension of the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t45t48+849+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2846%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%2830701%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">Carriage of Good by Sea Act</a> (COGSA) [46 USC &sect; 30701]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08-1553_ca9decision.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that the district court did not consider whether the parties had properly opted out of the Carmack Act, without which the COGSA does not apply. Counsel for the petitioners argued:<blockquote>From its enactment in 1906 until very recently, it has been settled law for a century that the Carmack Amendment does not apply to the inland leg of an import through shipment. ... [T]he current scope of Carmack is consistent with its historic scope, which had a very limited special application to exports to Canada and Mexico. Other than that, it doesn&#39;t apply to foreign trade at all.</blockquote>Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of petitioners. Counsel for the respondents argued that, &quot;[i]t does not take great mental gymnastics to read the plain language of this statute and resolve it the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-158.pdf">Magwood v. Patterson</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-to-hear-habeas-corpus.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether, when a person is resentenced after having obtained federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> relief from an earlier sentence, a claim in a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petition challenging that new sentencing judgment a &quot;second or successive&quot; claim under <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t26t28+3364+0++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2828%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%282244%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">28 USC &sect; 2244(b)</a> [text] if the petitioner could have challenged his previous sentence on the same constitutional grounds. The basic issue is whether a defendant can raise a challenge that could have been but was not raised in an earlier <em>habeas</em> petition. The case involves defendant Billy Joe Magwood, on death row in Alabama. Magwood was sentenced to death for murdering a county sheriff. His original death sentence was overturned in 1986, but he was later sentenced to death again. He challenged the second sentence, but the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200712208.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that his claim should have been raised in the first sentencing. Counsel for Magwood argued Wednesday that, &quot;a petition, as here, that challenges a new death sentence cannot be a second or successive petition for the very simple reason that it challenges a State court judgment that has no - never been covered in a <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petition before.&quot; Counsel for the respondents argued:<blockquote>You have equitable principles that say when you have two parties, a party has a full and fair opportunity to praise a claim or to litigate. But the other party also has a finality interest. And once you take away your full and fair opportunity by not using it, the other party&#39;s interest in finality outweighs. That&#39;s what Congress envisioned in AEDPA. That&#39;s what this Court envisioned with the abuse of the write [sic] doctrine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&jurcdj=jurcdj&newform=newform&docj=docj&docop=docop&docnoj=docnoj&typeord=ALLTYP&numaff=&ddatefs=16&mdatefs=3&ydatefs=2010&ddatefe=23&mdatefe=3&ydatefe=2010&nomusuel=&domaine=&mots=&resmax=100&Submit=Rechercher">ruled</a> [judgment materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/P_62417/">press release</a>, PDF] Tuesday that <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] did not violate trademark law by selling advertising linked to trademarked names. The court reasoned that Google was merely a platform for ads, clearing all search engines from trademark liability and protecting their main source of revenue. The luxury-goods group <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [corporate website] first brought suit four years ago accusing Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=adwords&cd=DE&hl=en_GB&ltmpl=adwords&passive=false&ifr=false&alwf=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fadwords.google.co.uk%2Fum%2Fgaiaauth%3Fapt%3DNone%26ugl%3Dtrue">AdWords</a> [service website] system of infringing upon companies&#39; trademarks by allowing advertisers, including competitors and those selling imitation or counterfeit products, to purchase advertising space when a user searches for a product or trademarked name. While the court found AdWords to be a legal &quot;information society service,&quot; it charged advertisers to make it clear that their products are different than the trademarked keyword. Google responded that the judgment <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/european-court-of-justice-rules-in.html">reinforced</a> [press release] the &quot;fundamental principle behind the free flow of information over the internet.&quot; Additionally, Google stated that it works with brand owners to remove links to websites selling counterfeit goods.<br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s judgment follows an <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ecj-advisory-opinion-finds-google-ad.php">advisory opinion against LVMH</a> [JURIST report] issued by the EJC last year after the case was referred by the <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Cour de Cassation</a> [official website, in French], France&#39;s highest court. In a separate case, a French court in February ordered Internet auction house eBay to pay LVMH &#8364;200,000 ($275,000) in <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-rules-ebay-intentionally.php">damages</a> [JURIST report] for paying search engines to direct customers to counterfeit LVMH products. The court found that eBay registered names similar to Louis Vuitton with search engines knowing that consumers looking for counterfeit products would search using those terms and be led to auctions on eBay selling those goods. In 2008, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rules-ebay-has-no-duty-to.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that eBay has no duty to actively monitor its site for counterfeit goods. Earlier in 2008, however, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">ordered eBay to pay LVMH $63 million</a> [JURIST report] for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two <a href="/currentawareness/uighurs.php">Uighurs</a> held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives] were <a href="http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home/dokumentation/mi/2010/2010-03-23.html">transferred to Switzerland</a> [press release] on Wednesday. Switzerland granted humanitarian type B residence permits allowing the two to live in the canton of Jura. Both have agreed to respect Swiss laws, learn the local language, and secure gainful employment. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] reported that the detainees had been <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/March/10-ag-301.html">cleared for release</a> [press release] by the interagency Guantanamo Review Task Force and were transferred pursuant to an agreement with the government of Switzerland. The Swiss Federal Council <a href="http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home/dokumentation/mi/2010/2010-02-030.html">announced</a> [press release] earlier this month that it would provide sanctuary, despite <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-warns-switzerland-against.php">warnings</a> [JURIST report] from Chinese officials that doing so would jeopardize relations between the two countries.<br /><br />Of the 22 Uighurs originally detained at Guantanamo Bay, 15 others have also accepted offers of relocation to other countries. Six Uighurs were transferred to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, four to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> and five to <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">Albania</a> [JURIST reports]. This transfer comes after the US Supreme Court on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] in <u>Kiyemba II</u>, a case regarding issues surrounding the transfer of Uighur Guantanamo Bay detainees. Lawyers for four Uighurs detained at Guantanamo were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-seek.php">appealing</a> [JURIST report] an April <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200904/05-5487-1174543.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/dc-circuit-rules-courts-cannot-prevent.php">report</a>] by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Columbia Circuit, which held that US courts cannot prevent the government from transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries on the grounds that detainees may face prosecution or torture in the foreign country.  The case is separate from a case the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-sends-uighur-case-back-to.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] to the DC circuit court earlier this month, known as <u>Kiyemba I</u>. The Chinese government maintains that the Uighurs are members of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9179/east_turkestan_islamic_movement_etim.html">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [CFR backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. The US has previously rejected China&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-again-calls-for-return-of-uighur.php">calls to repatriate</a> [JURIST report] the Uighurs, citing fear of torture upon their return.

The transfer was approved by unanimous consent of the Guantanamo Review Task Force, an inter-agency group that reviewed several factors regarding the detainees, including security. The identities of the released detainees are being withheld due to security and privacy concerns. The DOJ stated that the US &quot;is grateful to Georgia for its willingness to support US efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay facility.&quot; More than 580 detainees have been transferred from Guantanamo Bay since 2002. With the departure of these last three detainees, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hGlHqscFNhJFQXJ1U98vSJOdoDJQD9EKM6B80">183 detainees remain</a> [AP report] in the military prison.<br /><br />This latest transfer comes after the Supreme Court on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] in <u>Kiyemba II</u>, a case regarding issues surrounding the transfer of Uighur Guantanamo Bay detainees. Also on Monday, a judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">ordered the release</a> of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Guantanamo detainee who had been accused of planning the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In February, four detainees were transferred to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania and Spain</a> [JURIST report]. Other countries that have accepted transfers include <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, Afghanistan, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algeria</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a> [JURIST reports].

		<title>Attorneys general of 13 states file suit against health care reform law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The attorneys general (AGs) of 13 states <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in federal court in Florida on Tuesday challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [HR 3590 materials]. The suit comes the same day that President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report]. The suit is being led by Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, who is joined by the AGs of South Carolina, Nebraska, Texas, Michigan, Utah, Pennsylvania, Alabama, South Dakota, Louisiana, Idaho, Washington and Colorado. Among the allegations in the suit are that the new law violates Article I, Sections <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section2">Two</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section9">Nine</a>, and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentx">Tenth Amendment</a> [text] of the US constitution by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. The plaintiffs also assert that the law should not be upheld under either the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">commerce clause</a> or the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/spending_power">spending power</a> [materials] granted to Congress under Article I. The suit asks for a declaratory judgment that the act is unconstitutional, an injunction against its enforcement, and attorney&#39;s fees.<br /><br />The suit by the AGs is the latest chapter in the contentious issue of health care reform in the US. Last week, Idaho Governor CL Otter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">became the first governor</a> [JURIST report] to sign into state law a bill barring the federal mandate to purchase health insurance. Earlier in March, the Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report], that Governor Bob McDonald has indicated he will sign. The AGs who filed suit today <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/gop-state-ags-threaten-legal-action.php">originally threatened</a> this action in December, after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">Senate passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] of the health care overhaul bill. The House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/house-passes-landmark-health-care.php">originally passed its version</a> [JURIST report] of the bill in November.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/index_en.htm">released reports</a> [press release] Tuesday that said <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/docs/com_2010_112_en.pdf">Bulgaria</a> [report, PDF; <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/95&format=PDF&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">summary</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/docs/com_2010_113_en.pdf">Romania</a> [report, PDF; <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/96&format=PDF&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">summary</a>, PDF] must do more to combat corruption and organized crime, and conduct judicial reforms in order to enjoy their full rights as members of the EU. The reports represent the sixth assessments for the newest members of the EU under the Control and Verification Mechanism (CVM), which was setup as a way to verify progress of the two nations in meeting EU benchmarks on the issues. The EC said Romania has struggled to keep momentum on judicial reform, but commended it for making progress on corruption while warning more work is needed:<blockquote>Only limited results can be demonstrated in judicial reform while no effective improvement could be noted for the difficult human resourcing situation in the judiciary and the capacity of the judicial system has been put under further strain by net staff losses. Regarding the fight against corruption, the report commends the continuously convincing track record of the National Anti-Corruption Directorate in the investigation and prosecution of high-level corruption cases. ... However, continued delays in high-level corruption trials, together with inconsistency and leniency in penalties applied by the courts, continue to present important challenges for Romania.</blockquote>The EC made similar comments on Bulgaria: <blockquote>Since mid-2009, Bulgaria responded to some recommendations of the Commission notably by an initiative to improve the objectivity of the annual appraisal of magistrates, the results of which however cannot be yet assessed. ... With regard to the fight against corruption and organised crime, Bulgaria plans to improve the effectiveness of the forfeiture of criminal assets by applying forfeiture to a wider group of persons related to a crime unless the legal origin of assets can be proven. ... Although a number of new investigations and indictments for high-level corruption and organised crime have recently been reported, delays in important cases continued and no conviction in a high-level case could be reported since mid 2009.</blockquote>According to the EC, it will continue support for the countries and provide its next assessment by this summer.<br /><br />The current assessments echo statements made in previous <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/progress_reports_en.htm">CVM progress reports</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/eu-says-bulgaria-romania-must-do-more.php">report</a>]. In January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania officially <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/germany-promises-to-put-constitution.php">joined the EU</a> [JURIST report] following six years of accession negotiations. Both countries have been required to comply with a series of benchmarks; failing to do so could result in EU intervention and the potential loss of economic aid under Articles 36-38 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:157:SOM:EN:HTML">Act of Accession</a> [text], which lays out <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/07/260&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">safeguard mechanisms</a> [EC backgrounder] in the event of problems posing a threat to the functioning of the EU.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Monday ordered the release of a <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee who had been accused of planning the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] terrorist attacks. <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/760-mohamedou-ould-slahi/">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</a> [NYT materials], a Mauritanian who has been in US custody for over seven years, brought a <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petition, claiming that he had been <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/22/1542227/detainee-abused-at-guantanamo.html">tortured in prison</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald</span> report] and had made confessions under duress. Slahi was once considered a key al Qaeda leader and prosecutors had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704841304575138013356640710.html">sought the death penalty against him</a> [WSJ report]. However, a prominent government prosecutor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/536/guantanamo-justice.html">stepped down from the case</a> [PBS interview] because he did not support the alleged abusive treatment used against Slahi. The judge&#39;s decision is currently classified, although the court suggested that the files will become available at a future date.<br /><br />Last year, the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/canada-court-rejects-guantanamo.php">dismissed an application</a> [JURIST report] by Slahi requesting access to records of interrogations conducted by the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) and the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/index-eng.htm">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) [official websites] both in Canada and at Guantanamo Bay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Myanmar Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit to repeal <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">election laws</a> [JURIST report] preventing pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] from participating in upcoming elections. The lawsuit was filed by Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website] in response to the recently enacted laws, which have garnered <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-election-laws-do-not-meet.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] for prohibiting persons with criminal records or overt religious affiliations from attaining candidacy in the upcoming elections. Suu Kyi has said that she believes the NLD should <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62M2SI20100323">not participate</a> [Reuters report] due to the restrictive nature of the election laws. The NLD will be required to decide whether to register for participation in the elections in the coming weeks.<br /><br />Last month, Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court dismissed Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-top-court-hears-latest-suu-kyi.php">latest appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the 18-month extension of her house arrest. Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/suu-kyi-appeals-house-arrest-to-myanmar.php">appealed to the high court</a> in November after a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">found her guilty</a> [JURIST reports] of violating the terms of her house arrest when she allowed an American to stay with her after he swam across a lake to her home. Suu Kyi, who has been in prison or under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-official-says-suu-kyi-to-be.php">released in November</a> [JURIST report], according to a government official, likely after the upcoming elections have taken place.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-acts-consistency-with-longst">executive order</a> [text] Wednesday continuing a prohibition on the use of federal funds for <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] except in cases of rape or incest or where a woman&#39;s life would be endangered. Some anti-abortion congressional Democrats <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlMpJGn28kqCcgU-aGcYE_ZHW-ywD9EL8N1G0">insisted on the order</a> [AP report] as a condition for their support of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [HR 3590 materials], which Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday. <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> [advocacy website] President Nancy Keenan called anti-abortion Democrats&#39; insistence on the executive order <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/news/press-releases/2010/pr03212010_execorder.html">&quot;deeply disappointing&quot;</a> [press release], saying that women&#39;s reproductive rights were being used as a bargaining chip. <a href="http://www.nrlc.org/default.html">National Right to Life</a> [advocacy website], meanwhile, called the executive order &quot;meaningless,&quot; saying &quot;it changes nothing&quot; and <a href="http://www.nrlc.org/AHC/Release032110.html">fails</a> [press release] &quot;to correct any of the serious pro-abortion provisions in the bill.&quot;<br /><br />The passage of the health care reform bill has been extremely controversial. The same day that the bill was signed into law, the attorneys general (AGs) for 13 states filed suit in federal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">challenging the constitutionality of the new law</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, Idaho Governor CL Otter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill banning a federal mandate that citizens purchase health insurance. Earlier in March, the Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Bob McDonald has indicated he will sign. The AGs who filed suit Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/gop-state-ags-threaten-legal-action.php">originally threatened</a> the action in December, after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">Senate passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] of the health care overhaul bill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/23/malaysia-end-charade-justice-anwar-trial">urged</a> [press release] the Malaysian government to drop all charges against former deputy prime minister <a href="http://www.anwaribrahim.com/inner.asp?z=3">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Anwar+Ibrahim">news archive</a>]. Anwar is accused of inappropriate sexual advances toward a male aide in 2008. HRW alleges that the trial has been &quot;plagued by serious due process problems and government interference&quot; and that the government should therefore drop all charges against Anwar. HRW Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said, &quot;[t]he government should end this charade of justice and drop the charges against Anwar. Every step of the way, the court has blocked Anwar&#39;s lawyers from preparing a thorough defense.&quot; Anwar&#39;s trial is expected to resume on March 25.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Malaysian Federal Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/malaysia-appeals-court-rules-opposition.php">rejected</a> Anwar&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">claim</a> [JURIST reports] that his 1998 removal from office was unconstitutional. Anwar <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-sodomy-trial.php">went on trial</a> in July on <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">new allegations</a> of sodomy, to which he has pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-opposition-leader-enters-not.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST reports]. Anwar&#39;s attempts to have the case dismissed have been repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-appeals-court-refuses-to.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by the court. Anwar was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/10/98/malaysia_crisis/186916.stm">removed from office</a> [BBC report] in 1998 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">banned from political life</a> [JURIST report] for 10 years amid accusations of corruption, abuse of office, and sexual misconduct of which he was acquitted in 2004.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Tuesday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-and-vice-president-signing-health-insurance-reform-bill">signed into law</a> [transcript of remarks] a bill to significantly alter the US health care system. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [HR 3590 materials] was presented to the president on Monday after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-passes-health-care-reform.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the House of Representatives by a margin of 219-212 on Sunday. The new law will prohibit insurance providers from denying coverage to children because of pre-existing conditions and dropping individuals from insurance plans because of illness, and will require all insurance providers to provide a rationale for proposed increases in premiums. Prior to signing the bill, Obama made a series of remarks, paying homage to the individuals past and present who had worked for reform in the health care system.<br /><br /><object width="480" height="300"><param name="movie" value="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player/player.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="bgcolor" value="282828"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><param name="flashvars" value="file=http://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/2010/March/032310_EastRoom.m4v&path_to_plugins=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins&path_to_player=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player&skin=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player/skins/EOP_skin.swf&captions_url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/av_closedcaption/032310_Signs_Health_Reform_Into_Law.srt&image=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/audio-video/video_thumbnail/hcr.jpg&controlbar=bottom&frontcolor=AAAAAA&plugins=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/privacy/privacy,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/hat/hat,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/share/share,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/captions/captions&captions.file=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/av_closedcaption/032310_Signs_Health_Reform_Into_Law.srt"></param><embed src="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player/player.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="300" flashvars="file=http://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/2010/March/032310_EastRoom.m4v&path_to_plugins=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins&path_to_player=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player&skin=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/all/modules/swftools/shared/flash_media_player/skins/EOP_skin.swf&captions_url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/av_closedcaption/032310_Signs_Health_Reform_Into_Law.srt&image=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/audio-video/video_thumbnail/hcr.jpg&controlbar=bottom&frontcolor=AAAAAA&plugins=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/privacy/privacy,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/hat/hat,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/share/share,http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/modules/wh_multimedia/wh_jwplayer/plugins/captions/captions&captions.file=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/av_closedcaption/032310_Signs_Health_Reform_Into_Law.srt&stretching=fill&menu=false"></embed></object><br /><br />In <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-and-vice-president-health-insurance-reform-bill-department-interi">remarks</a> [transcript] made at the Department of the Interior after signing the bill, Obama indicated that many of the provisions will require several years before they are fully implemented, though some, such as the prohibition on excluding children for pre-existing conditions, will take effect immediately.<br /><br />The passage of the health care reform bill has been extremely controversial. The same day that the bill was signed into law, the attorneys general (AGs) for 13 states filed suit in federal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">challenging the constitutionality of the new law</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, the Idaho Governor CL Otter, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill banning a federal mandate that citizens purchase health insurance. Earlier in March, the Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report], that Governor Bob McDonald has indicated he will sign. The AGs who filed suit Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/gop-state-ags-threaten-legal-action.php">originally threatened</a> the action in December, after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">Senate passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] of the health care overhaul bill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Russian police officer <a href="http://dymovskiy.name/">Alexei Dymovsky</a> [advocacy website, in Russian] was found guilty Tuesday in a defamation lawsuit for accusing Russian law enforcement officials of corruption on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [corporate website]. A district court in the Russian city of Novorossiisk <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=14947311&PageNum=0">ordered</a> [ITAR-TASS report] Dymovsky to pay both the chief of Novorosiisk police Vladimir Chernositov and chief of the Primorye precinct Valery Medvedev 50,000 rubles ($1,800) each. Dymovsky <a href="http://en.beta.rian.ru/russia/20091108/156756323.html">criticized</a> [RIA Novosti report] the law enforcement officials last September. In the YouTube video addressed to Russian <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>], Drmovsky accused his superior officials of pressuring officers to improve their own crime statistics. He was also critical of the condition under which officers are expected to work. Dymovsky was fired following the video&#39;s posting, and was <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100307/158120262.html">imprisoned</a> [RIA Novosti report] for six weeks earlier this year. The <a href="http://eng.mvdrf.ru/">Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website] has ordered a probe into Dymovsky&#39;s accusations.<br /><br />Dymovsky provides yet another example of corruption in the Russian law enforcement community. Six Russian officers <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/6-cops-vanish-after-their-names-are-leaked-in-graft-case/402408.html">disappeared</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] on Wednesday after their names were released to the media for falsely arresting homeless people in order to improve their crime figures. In January, Putin called for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-pm-calls-for-human-rights.php">new age of human rights and safety</a> [JURIST report] in the Caucasus region of Russia, where the killings of journalists and activists have become increasingly common. Deaths of human rights workers are often blamed on the local police and security forces, who rarely face charges. Also in January, a Russian journalist <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-journalist-dies-after-being.php">died in prison</a> [JURIST report] from injuries suffered during a police beating. In December, Putin called for <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-pm-urges-greater-anti-corruption.php">greater oversight of officials</a> [JURIST report] after a nightclub fire in Perm exposed widespread corruption among bureaucrats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://aclutx.org/files/32410FBOpinion.pdf">permanent injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday against a Texas city ordinance prohibiting <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive] from renting property in the city. Judge Jane Boyle ruled that the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch cannot enforce <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/sites/default/files/Ordinance%20No%202952.pdf">Ordinance 2952</a> [text, PDF], which required prospective renters to affirm they were in the country legally, finding it to be preempted by federal law under the US Constitution&#39;s supremacy clause. The ordinance allowed the city to revoke a potential renter&#39;s residential occupancy license, a license required for anyone to rent a dwelling under the ordinance, if the federal government determined the immigrant was not in the country legally. Boyle wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />This is not a situation where the City is aiding in the enforcement of federal immigration law based on federal standards through the means set forth by federal law; rather, the City is attempting to enforce its own scheme that incorporates federal standards for purposes not contemplated by Congress. The City may take appropriate action to enforce the nation&#8217;s immigration laws, but it may not, even if it were to incorporate the proper standard, independently enforce its own immigration rules.<br /></blockquote><br />Plaintiffs were represented by the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) and the <a href="http://www.aclutx.org/index.php">American Civil Liberties Union of Texas</a> (ACLUTX), which <a href="http://maldef.org/news/releases/farmers_branch_03242010/">welcomed</a> [press release] Boyle&#39;s ruling.<br /><br />Boyle <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-blocks-dallas-suburb.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against enforcement of the ordinance in 2008. In the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/farmersbranch_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dallas-suburb-faces-lawsuit-over.php">filed earlier in 2008</a> [JURIST report], several landlords and a former City Council member challenged the constitutionality of Ordinance 2952, alleging it denied immigrants equal protection and due process rights. The city <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dallas-suburb-approves-new-rental.php">passed the ordinance</a> [JURIST report] after a previous law, <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/Communication/Ordinance%20No%202903.doc">Ordinance 2903</a> [DOC text], was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-federal-court-strikes-down-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by a US district judge in 2007 as an infringement of federal supremacy in the area of immigration. The Farmers Branch City Council passed the latest ordinance in an attempt to cure that flaw.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> (NYT) [media website] on Wednesday agreed to pay a total of $114,000 in damages to Singapore <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/Mr+Lee+Hsien+Loong.htm">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong</a> and his father, former prime minister <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/CabinetAppointments/Mr%2BLEE%2BKuan%2BYew.htm">Lee Kuan Yew</a> [official profiles], for an article that may have implied that the current prime minister attained his position as a result of their relationship. The paper also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/opinion/global/24iht-opednote.html?scp=21&sq=Singapore&st=nyt">apologized</a> [text] to the two leaders. The offending article, written by <a href="http://global.nytimes.com/?iht">International Herald Tribune</a> [media website] contributor Phillip Bowring on February 15, was titled &quot;All in the Family,&quot; and identified several political dynasties in Asia. In its apology, the NYT wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />In a February 15, 2010, article, Mr. Bowring ... included these two men in a list of Asian political dynasties, which may have been understood by readers to infer that the younger Mr. Lee did not achieve his position through merit. We wish to state clearly that this inference was not intended. We apologize to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for any distress or embarrassment caused by any breach of the undertaking and the article.<br /></blockquote><br />Bowring&#39;s article contained a single reference to Singapore: &quot;The list of Asian countries with governments headed by the offspring or spouses of former leaders is striking. ... Singapore&#39;s Lee Hsien Loong is Lee Kuan Yew&#39;s son.&quot; The newspaper removed the article, but it remains <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?col=&section=opinion&xfile=data/opinion/2010/February/opinion_February98.xml">available</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Khaleej Times</span> text] from other sources.<br /><br />Singapore leaders have sought damages against media organizations for alleged defamation before. Last March, a judge for the <a href="http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=1">Supreme Court of Singapore</a> [official website] ruled that a <a href="http://www.wsj-asia.com/">Wall Journal Journal Asia</a> [media website] editor was in contempt of court and <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/singapore-judge-fines-wsj-asia-editor.php">personally liable for damages</a> [JURIST report] for publishing two editorials and a letter that criticized the impartiality of the city-state&#39;s judiciary.

The government has declared that the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-47120920100322">proposed changes comport</a> [Reuters report] with European Union (EU) standards, but Gerceker said that does not mean they should be blindly applied in Turkey. <br /><br />The Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-unveils-proposed.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] the controversial proposed amendments to 22 articles of the Turkish Constitution on Monday in hopes of making the government more democratic and strengthening the country&#39;s bid to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">join the EU</a> [admission criteria]. The proposed amendments cover a <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=government-unveils-controversial-package-2010-03-22">wide range of issues</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report], including the judicial system, women&#39;s rights, and collective bargaining for civil servants. The major reforms proposed include an amendment that would make party closures more difficult and an amendment to restructure the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HYSK) and the <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/">Constitutional Court</a> [official websites, in Turkish]. Also included is an amendment to Article 15, which bans the prosecution of the 1980 coup leaders. The reform movement, led by Turkey&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], has been challenged by the opposition party Republican People&#39;s Party (CHP). The bill will now go before Parliament, where it must be approved by two-thirds of the 550 members to become law.

		<title>Google stops censoring China search results after legal dispute</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?rls=ig">Google</a> [corporate website] officially stopped censoring search results to Chinese users on Tuesday after a legal impasse was reached between the Internet giant and the Chinese government. Google announced Monday that it would be <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html">rerouting</a> [press release] the Google.cn website through the company&#39;s Hong Kong site, which is not censored. Google explained its decision, stating:<br /><blockquote><br />Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on Google.cn has been hard. We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement. We believe this new approach of providing uncensored search in simplified Chinese from Google.com.hk is a sensible solution to the challenges we&#39;ve faced - it&#39;s entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China. We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision.<br /></blockquote><br />China quickly responded to Google&#39;s rerouting plans and has now begun blocking results from the Hong Kong website as well. China claims that <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2010-03/23/content_1562305.htm">Google did not uphold agreements</a> [Xinhua report] the firm had made when it entered the Chinese market in 2006, and that the company &quot;violated its written promise&quot; when it ceased censoring Internet searches. Chinese <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu stated in a press conference that the dispute with Google will <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/fyrbt/t674783.htm">not affect relations</a> [transcript, in Chinese] between the US and China &quot;unless someone politicizes the issue.&quot;<br /><br />In February, China issued new regulations <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">tightening restrictions on Internet use</a> [JURIST report] by requiring citizens operating websites to submit identity cards and meet with regulators before their sites can be registered. The new policies came amid negotiations with Google regarding the Internet company&#39;s January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">threat to discontinue operations in China</a> [JURIST report] due to the country&#39;s overarching Internet censorship. Google&#39;s action was in response to a cyber attack on its Gmail service in December, which targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists in China and drew the ire of rights groups around the world. Google indicated that it would work with the Chinese government to find a way to allow an, &quot;unfiltered search engine within the law as well,&quot; but also noted that if an agreement cannot be reached, it would close its offices there and shut down its Google.cn website. China <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">responded</a> [JURIST report] by reiterating its commitment to open Internet, but stressed that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. A week later, US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-defends-internet-freedom-policies.php">referenced the threat</a> [JURIST report] by Google in a speech promoting Internet freedom and criticizing censorship, declaring that China &quot;risk[s] walling themselves off from the progress of the next century.&quot; Zhaoxu criticized Clinton for her remarks stating that they were harmful to bilateral relations between the US and China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] on Friday <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/news/news-11546/">banned</a> [press release, in Russian] Adolf Hitler&#39;s book <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> [Britannica backgrounder], finding it in violation of laws against extremism. The step was taken pursuant to Article I of Russia&#39;s Law to Combat Extremist Activities. According to the statement from the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, &quot;[t]he autobiographical book contains the ideas of Hitler&#39;s National Socialism, presenting the militaristic outlook that justifies discrimination and destruction of non-Aryan races that led to the start of World War II.&quot; <u>Mein Kempf</u> is readily available on Russian websites and also in bookshops throughout the country, but now people caught distributing or selling the book <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Russia_Bans_Mein_Kampf/1994662.html">could be fined</a> [RFE/RL report]. Some political commentators believe this step could contribute to a decrease of hate crimes in Russia, but others remain skeptical, saying it will be <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22/20100326/tpl-uk-russia-hitler-ban-4b8df73.html">too difficult to stifle distribution</a> [Reuters report], particularly via the Internet. <u>Mein Kampf</u> has also been banned in Austria, China and Germany, and its access is limited is several other countries.<br /><br />Russia is currently struggling to limit hate crimes, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">decreased in 2009</a> [JURIST report] according to the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website]. The Center report that 71 people were killed and 333 wounded in Russia in racially motivated attacks in 2009, down from 110 killed and 487 wounded in 2008. In December, the Russian <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/vs_index.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-supreme-court-bans-jehovahs.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to shut down the Taganrog Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and ban the distribution of 34 Jehovah&#39;s Witness publications, finding both the Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and the publications are to be extremist. In 2007, the Russian parliament approved legislative amendments to <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">change the prevailing definition of extremist crime</a> [JURIST report] in Russian law to include activities taken for &quot;political or ideological hatred.&quot;

The <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.13 materials] decries &quot;grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, in particular the use of torture and labour camps against political prisoners and repatriated citizens of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea.&quot; The council extended the assignment of <a href="http://www0.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Special Rapporteur Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [official profile] for one year and asked that North Korea and the UN General Assembly cooperate with and assist Muntarbhorn in his mission.<br /><br />Earlier this month Muntarbhorn, who has not been admitted into North Korea, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/north-korea-rights-situation-continuing.php">presented a report</a> [JURIST report] to the UNHRC that found the situation in North Korea was deteriorating and that sanctions had not improved human rights conditions. In October, Muntarbhorn <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for human rights violations. Muntarbhorn said that North Korea was responsible for a broad range of <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/press/hrc/index.htm">human rights violations</a> [press release], including torture, public executions, and widespread hunger. In March 2009, Muntarbhorn told the UNHRC that he found egregious <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-investigator-cites-north.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea. In October 2008, Muntarbhorn <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-investigator-urges-north-korea-to.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] North Korea to improve its treatment of prisoners and unsuccessful defectors, as well as to cooperate in locating kidnapped foreign citizens. In January 2008, Muntarbhorn made similar comments during his visit with a special UN envoy to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/north-korea-still-violating-human.php">Japan</a> [JURIST report] to assess the impact of the North Korean rights situation on that country. North Korea has frequently been accused of human trafficking, press repression, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/north-korea-committing-crimes-against.php">&quot;actively committing crimes against humanity&quot;</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Rwandan opposition politician pleaded guilty Thursday to charges connected to the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder] and was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Joseph Ntawangundi, an aid to Hutu opposition leader Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, was <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14210&article=27340">convicted <em>in absentia</em></a> [<em>New Times</em> report] in 2007, and originally sentenced to 19 years in prison. Ntawangundi pleaded guilty after returning to Rwanda after many years in exile and received a two-year reduction in his sentence. The panel of judges for the <a href="http://www.inkiko-gacaca.gov.rw/En/EnIntroduction.htm">Gacaca</a> [official website], a system of local courts created to accelerate genocide trial proceedings, found Ntawangundi guilty of organizing the deaths of Tutsis while principal of a school in Gitwe. Ntawangundi originally maintained that he was not present in Rwanda at the time of the killing. The decision comes at a time when current Tutsi <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website] has received <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/02/10/rwanda-end-attacks-opposition-parties">criticism</a> [press release] from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] for his treatment of opposition parties. Ingabire Umuhoza <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201002220435.html">denied</a> [<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">New Times</span> report] Ntawangundi&#39;s participation, arguing that Ntawangundi left the country in 1992 and that the Gacaca courts are being used to undermine political opposition. <br /><br />Rwanda continues to try and convicted individuals who were responsible for the 1994 genocide. The <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>], was established for the prosecution of high-level officials responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law during the Rwandan genocide. Last week, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-tribunal-affirms-genocide.php ">affirmed the genocide conviction</a> [JURIST report] of popular Rwandan singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/simon_bikindi_221.html">Simon Bikindi</a> [Trial Watch profile]. The court also reversed the conviction for counts of genocide, murder, and extermination against Rwandan district attorney Simeon Nchamihigo. Earlier this month, the widow of assassinated Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana, Agathe Habyarimana, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-ex-presidents-widow-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France on suspicions of complicity in genocide and was later released on bail. In January, the Rwandan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rwanda-report-finds-hutus-responsible.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] concluding that the assassination of then-president Juvenal Habyarimana, which sparked the genocide, was the work of Hutu extremists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="/pdf/noriegaliftingorder.pdf">lifted the stay</a> [order, PDF] blocking the extradition of former Panamanian military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>] to France, where he is wanted on money laundering charges. This latest order comes two days after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> last month after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January.  Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement.<br /><br />Noriega has been <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fighting extradition</a> [JURIST report] since 2007. He is wanted in France on charges of money laundering through French banks. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail in 1999, but France has agreed to hold a new trial if he is extradited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] on Wednesday approved a <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(ViewDoc)?OpenAgent&work/dz.nsf/ByID&89FFCCEEF02759E9C32576F000472078">bill</a> [text, DOC, in Russian; <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/faces/lawsearch/gointra.jsp?c=336086-5">bill history</a>, in Russian] to ban pre-trial detention for suspects accused of economic crimes. The legislation would allow those charged with financial crimes to be <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100324/158297744.html">bailed out of jail</a> [RIA Novosti report] at any time during legal proceedings for a minimum bail charge of 100,000 rubles (USD $3,300), and 500,000 rubles (USD $16,600) for serious crimes. The bill was <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100301/158054387.html">introduced</a> [RIA Novosti report] earlier this month by Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian], who said that the measure would help cut the prison population and would also prevent prison from being used to pressure businessmen. The bill&#39;s introduction was <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/medvedev-pushes-russian-courts-bail-economic-crime-suspects">welcomed</a> [press release] by the lawyer for <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">Yukos Oil</a> [JURIST news archive] founder <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>], who was denied bail in 2003. The bill must now be approved by the upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://council.gov.ru/index.html">Federation Council</a> [official website, in Russian].<br /><br />Khodorkovsky recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Russian justice system as an &quot;assembly line&quot; that inevitably finds the government&#39;s political enemies to be guilty. Both he and former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are serving time on tax evasion and fraud charges, but Lebedev <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-high-court-to-review-arrest-of.php">successfully challenged</a> [JURIST report] the legality of his arrest and was awarded USD $14,300 in damages and legal fees by the European Court of Human Rights. The two are currently on trial on <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">additional related charges</a> of money laundering and embezzlement, to which they have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/khodorkovsky-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports]. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition to former Russian president and current <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK Parliament&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/jchr/">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> [official website] recommended Thursday that the government <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200910/jtselect/jtrights/86/86.pdf">review anti-terror laws and policies</a> [report, PDF; <a href="http://news.parliament.uk/2010/03/committee-questions-justification-for-counter-terrorism-measures/">press release</a>] passed since the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] attacks to make sure they are necessary and do not violate human rights. The committee found that, despite claiming to support human rights, many government policies appeared to threaten those rights, questioning whether policies that may have been appropriate in the aftermath of the terror attacks should be maintained indefinitely. Concerns cited in the report include the appearance that the government has intentionally turned a blind eye to torture, the increased use of secret evidence in court, and the possibility of detaining suspects without bringing charges. The committee stated, &quot;[w]e are concerned that the Government&#39;s approach means that in effect there is a permanent state of emergency, and that this inevitably has a deleterious effect on public debate about the justification for counter-terrorism measures.&quot; The report recommended establishing a commission to investigate the government&#39;s complicity in torture in light of the recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-court-releases-previously-withheld.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">Binyam Mohammad</a> [JURIST news archive] case. The report also recommended creating an office for a term of five years to study terrorism legislation and report to Parliament on the legislation as it relates to human rights.<br /><br />Earlier this week, members of Parliament and human rights organizations signed a letter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-mps-rights-groups-call-for-torture.php">calling for an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the UK&#39;s role in torture and rendition. Last week, British <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] failed to deliver a promised public <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uk-to-publish-detainee-interrogation.php">revision of guidelines</a> [JURIST report] given to UK intelligence officers for the treatment of detainees. Brown faces growing scrutiny of UK detainee procedures amid allegations from former <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee Binyam Mohamed that British intelligence officials were involved in his torture in Morocco. In February, rights group Reprieve <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-rights-group-suing-government-over.php">initiated a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the UK government over its alleged torture of detainees, claiming that its unwillingness to disclose detainee policies suggests that they permit illegal torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9940&LangID=E">passed three resolutions</a> [press release] critical of Israeli practices towards Syrian and Palestinian territories. The resolutions were <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1158708.html">adopted</a> [Haaretz report] during the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/13session/index.htm">13th session of the UNHRC</a> [materials] held in Geneva. One resolution titled &quot;The grave human rights violations by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem&quot; passed by a vote of 31 to 9 and made specific demands on Israel including:<blockquote>... that the occupying Power, Israel, end its occupation of the Palestinian land occupied since 1967, and that it respect its commitments within the peace process towards the establishment of the independent sovereign Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in peace and security with all its neighbours;<br /><br />... that the occupying Power, Israel, stop the targeting of civilians and the systematic destruction of the cultural heritage of the Palestinian people, in addition to the destruction of public and private properties, as laid down in the Fourth Geneva Convention<br /><br />... that Israel, the occupying Power, respect the religious and cultural rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly in occupied East Jerusalem, as provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core international human rights instruments, the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions, and that it allow Palestinian citizens and worshippers unhindered access to their properties and religious sites therein</blockquote>The other resolutions were critical of new and established <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/d_res_dec/A_HRC_13_L_28.doc">Israeli settlements</a> [draft text, DOC] in East Jerusalem, the Occupied Palestinian territories, and Golan and Israeli treatment of the Syrian people in Golan. A resolution supporting the Palestinian people&#39;s right to self-determination was also <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=171739">passed</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem Post</span> report]. Additionally, the UNHRC is expected to approve another resolution Thursday calling for Israel to compensate Palestinians who were injured during last year&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm">Operation Cast Lead</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder].<br /><br />Israel has denounced the actions of the UNHRC many times in recent years. In October, the Israeli government <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-urges-international-community-to.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a UNHRC <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/12/docs/A-HRC-S-12-L1.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-council-adopts-gaza-conflict.php">report</a>] endorsing the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">final report</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm">UN Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict</a> [official website]. The Israeli Foreign Ministry called the resolution &quot;one-sided&quot; and called on the international community to join Israel in rejecting it. In November 2008, an Israeli representative to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-derides-discriminatory-un-rights.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the UNHRC of &quot;targeting Israel in an obsessive and discriminatory fashion&quot; and &quot;fail[ing] to uphold the basic standards of human rights in an impartial, universal, non-selective, and objective manner.&quot; In April 2008, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-bars-un-palestinian-rights-envoy.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would no longer allow a UNHRC envoy on Israeli human rights to enter either Israel or the Palestinian territories after he called current Israeli actions against Palestinians a &quot;Holocaust in the making.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/default.aspx?/">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] human rights office on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34198&Cr=afghan&Cr1=">called on the government to repeal</a> [UN News Centre report] the controversial <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1074897.html">National Stability and Reconciliation Law</a> [RFE/RL backgrounder], which provides amnesty for war crimes and human rights violations committed before December 2001. A representative of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Afghanistan said at a <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=1741&ctl=Details&mid=1882&ItemID=8250">press conference</a> [transcript]:<br /><blockquote><br />The lack of political commitment to the justice agenda is seen by the High Commissioner as an urgent concern exemplified by the Amnesty Law; it was gazetted in December 2008 but it only came to light at the end of last year. This Law relieves Afghan authorities of their obligation to investigate and prosecute, on their own initiative, those allegedly responsible for gross violations of human rights. It contravenes Afghanistan&#39;s obligations under international law and it green-lights impunity and continued human rights violations. It ignores the grievances of victims and denies them access to justice. This Law also sends the wrong message to victims who have repeatedly called for justice and the removal of human rights violators from public office. <br /></blockquote><br />The call for repeal comes the day after the <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Portals/UNAMA/human%20rights/March%202010_HC%20Report.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF] of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Afghanistan was presented in Geneva to the Human Rights Council.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Afghanistan Office of the President <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-confirms-enactment-of-war.php">confirmed for the first time</a> [JURIST report] that the law had been enacted by a two-thirds passage in the Parliament, which, under the constitution, does not require the president&#39;s signature. Afghanistan&#39;s Parliament approved the controversial law in 2007, but international human rights groups only became aware of the law when it was published in Afghanistan&#39;s latest official gazette. A week before the confirmation by the Office of the President, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-afghanistan-to.php">urged the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the law. HRW called the law an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot; and &quot;a slap in the face to all the Afghans who suffered for years and years of war crimes and warlordism.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia </a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2009cv2368-14">denied</a> [order, PDF] a Yemeni <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee&#39;s <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> petition on its merits, allowing the US government to prolong the detention indefinitely. Detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/117-muktar-yahya-najee-al-warafi">Makhtar Yahia Naji al Warafi</a> [NYT materials] was captured during the 2001-2002 American intervention campaign in Afghanistan and maintains that he was only a medical clinic worker at the time. The US government alleges that Pentagon intelligence demonstrates Warafi was a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/25/1546737/judge-oks-holding-yemeni-who-says.html"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">trained jihadist</font></a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> report]. The order by judge Royce Lamberth cites a classified memorandum containing details of the reasoning, which was filed with the court security officer. Also Wednesday, Judge Gladys Kessler of the DC District Court <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv0280-556">dismissed</a> [text, PDF] without prejudice the <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> petition of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/576-zahar-omar-hamis-bin-hamdoun">Zahar Bin Hamdoun</a> [NYT materials], who was captured in 2002 in Pakistan. Hamdoun&#39;s lawyers had requested that the court <a href="http://chesney.jnslp.com/2010/03/25/nationalsecuritylaw-a-gtmo-habeas-petition-denied-on-the-merits-and-another-dismissed-without-prejudice/">delay</a> [JNSLP report] proceedings in order to confer with him over new developments pertaining to evidence in the case.<br /><br />Earlier this week, Judge James Robertson of the DC District Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mauritanian Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/760-mohamedou-ould-slahi/">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</a> [NYT materials], who had been accused of planning the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] terrorist attacks. Slahi has been in US  custody for over seven years and brought a <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> petition, claiming that he had been <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/03/22/1542227/detainee-abused-at-guantanamo.html">tortured in prison</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> report] and had made confessions under duress. In late February, Kessler ruled that the government can <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-upholds-continued.php">continue to hold indefinitely</a> [JURIST report] two Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainees, even though <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv0280-551">Fahmi   Salem Al-Assani</a> and <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv0280-548">Suleiman Awadh Bin Agil Al-Nahdi</a> [orders, PDF] had been cleared for release by the Bush administration two years ago. The US government has prevailed in 12 of the 46 <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> cases <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=US+District+Court+for+the+District+of+Columbia+habeas+corpus">decided</a> [JURIST news archive] in the DC District Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] on Thursday called for a renewed international commitment to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/slaveryremembranceday/sgmessages.shtml">eradicate all forms of slavery</a> [statement text]. Ban&#39;s comments took place on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/slaveryremembranceday/index.shtml">International Day of Remembrance of Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade</a> [press release], which is held annually pursuant to General Assembly resolution <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/slaveryremembranceday/ga_resolution.shtml">A/62/L.32</a> [text]. In his statement, Ban said that the fight against slavery continues even though the practice may now take different forms than it has in the past:<blockquote>Slavery is abhorrent. It is explicitly prohibited by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the United Nations has reaffirmed this principle many times, including in the Durban Declaration adopted at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism.<br /><br />But slavery and slavery-like practices continue in many parts of the world. Slavery is mutating and re-emerging in modern forms, including debt bondage, the sale of children, and the trafficking of women and girls for sex. Its roots lie in ignorance, intolerance and greed.<br /><br />We must create a climate in which such abuse and cruelty are inconceivable. One way is by remembering the past and honouring the victims of the transatlantic slave trade. By reminding ourselves of past injustices, we help to ensure that such systematic abuse of human rights can never be repeated.</blockquote>Ban&#39;s sentiments were echoed in a <a href="http://usun.state.gov/briefing/statements/2010/139001.htm">statement</a> [text] by Permanent US Representative to the UN <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/c31461.htm">Susan Rice</a> [official profile].<br /><br />In January, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/europe-court-rules-sex-trafficking.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that sex trafficking violates conventions against slavery and forced labor, finding both Russia and Cyprus liable in the case of a young woman who came from Russia to work in a Cyprus cabaret and was later found dead. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-begins-trial-for-congolese.php">began proceedings</a> [JURIST report] for the trial of two Congolese Nationals charged with war crimes including sexual slavery. During the same month, the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=b">War Crimes Court</a> [official website, in Bosnian] of Bosnia and Herzegovina <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/bosnia-court-convicts-former-serb.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Serbian commander Predrag Kujundzic of crimes against humanity, also accusing him of facilitating sexual slavery. In June 2009, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/senate-passes-resolution-apologizing.php">unanimously passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:sc26hds.txt.pdf">resolution</a> [S Con Res 26 text, PDF] apologizing to African-Americans for slavery and racial segregation.

According to an anonymous Kremlin spokesperson, the two countries have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/24/AR2010032401535.html?hpid=topnews">come to an agreement</a> [WP report] that will be finalized at a meeting Friday between US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> and Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profiles]. The new pact will supplant the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START I Treaty) [materials], signed in 1991. The agreement treaty will be legally binding on both countries and will reduce long-range nuclear weapons by dropping the ceiling of 2,200 to between 1,500 and 1,675. The agreement will also limit the number of jets, land-bases, and submarines that can have nuclear warheads. It is expected that Obama and Medvedev will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25start.html?ref=world">sign the agreement</a> [NYT report] at a ceremony on April 8 in Prague.<br /><br />The agreement comes after months of talks between the US and Russia since Obama and Medvedev came to tentative terms of the non-proliferation agreement in July. Both US and Russian officials have recently expressed desire to have the treaty in place prior to the upcoming <a href="http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100107_2654.php">Global Nuclear Security Summit</a> [NTI backgrounder] in April, and the <a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nonproliferation/articles/120909_global_nuclear_security_summit/">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference</a> [CAC fact sheet] in May. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">languished</a> [JURIST report] during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the former Cold War rivals, which reached their worst point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/032410zr.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] a temporary stay of execution for convicted murderer <a href="http://www.hankskinner.org/">Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Skinner</a> [advocacy website] who requested DNA testing be conducted in his case to prove his innocence. The court granted the stay just one hour prior to Skinner&#39;s execution and will now decide whether to grant <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span>. Skinner is requesting access to DNA testing based on a civil rights claim under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">&sect; 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871</a> [42 USC &sect; 1983 text] instead of a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> challenge. In his petition, Skinner argued that lower courts are unclear on whether a DNA access claim may be granted under civil rights law or only under a <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> challenge following the Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-6.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-6">District Attorney&#39;s Office v. Osborne</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-dna-evidence-and.php">report</a>]. The court is expected to make its decision to hear the case within the next few weeks. The French ambassador to the US had also <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100324-french-ambassador-calls-texas-spare-death-row-inmate-henry-hank-skinner">pressed for a stay of execution</a> [AFP report] for Skinner, who is married to a French anti-death penalty activist.<br /><br />Skinner was convicted in 1995 of killing his girlfriend, Twila Jean Busby, and her two adult sons. Skinner has maintained his innocence saying he was not capable of committing the murders because of the amount of drugs and alcohol in his system on the day of the murders. While the prosecutors in the case did rely on some DNA evidence in the case, Skinner&#39;s attorneys argue they were selective in the tests they conducted. In <u>District Attorney&#39;s Office v. Osborne</u>, the court held that a defendant does not have the right to obtain post-conviction access to the state&#8217;s biological evidence in order to do DNA testing. The decision involved a claim for access under section 1983, but the majority rejected that approach saying it &quot;would take the development of rules and procedures in this area out of the hands of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a focused manner and turn it over to federal courts applying the broad parameters of the Due Process Clause.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] on Wednesday proposed reforms to simplify and clarify international divorce laws. Under the proposal, married couples from different European Union (EU) countries could choose the country of the divorce, and the various courts would use a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/100&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">common formula</a> [press release] to decide which country&#39;s law applies when a couple disagrees. EC <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/index_en.htm">Vice President Viviane Reding</a> [official website] said the law will <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/347&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">protect</a> [press release] the weaker spouse and reduce the costs of litigation:<br /><blockquote><br />International couples can encounter arbitrary legal problems that turn the tragedy of divorce into a financial and emotional disaster, making peoples&#39; lives very hard. Thousands of couples find themselves in difficult personal situations because national legal systems have so far failed to provide clear answers. In many cases, children and the weaker spouse suffer. I do not want people in the EU to be left to manage complicated international divorces alone. I want them to have clear rules so that they always know where they stand. This is why we decided to move ahead today.<br /></blockquote><br />The measure, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8585186.stm">supported by 10 countries</a> [BBC report], is expected to be passed under <a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/enhanced_cooperation_en.htm">enhanced cooperation</a> [EU backgrounder], which allows nine or more members to pass a law they deem important.<br /><br />In January, EU Justice Ministers <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/eu-considering-enhanced-cooperation-to.php">debated</a> [JURIST report] whether to use enhanced cooperation for the first time to create a uniform marriage and divorce law for mixed-nationality couples. In hearings before the EU parliament, Reding said such a measure was <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-67126-011-01-03-901-20100111IPR67125-11-01-2010-2010-false/default_en.htm">necessary</a> [press release] because cross-border divorces were a big problem as the law across the member countries varied significantly. For instance, in July, the UK <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-court-recognizes-pre-nuptial.php">recognized prenuptial agreements</a> [JURIST report] as a valid contract for the first time, bringing its law in line with other European countries. The issue is currently on appeal before the UK Supreme Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Quezon City Trial Court in Manila on Thursday issued arrest warrants for 189 suspects for their alleged role in the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">November 2009 massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder] in semi-autonomous Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. Eight more individuals are also wanted in connection with the killings, but they are already <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/node/249503/court-order">in custody</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Manila Bulletin</span> report] on separate charges for allegedly mobilizing a rebellion to interfere with investigations into the massacre, including Andal Ampatuan Sr. and his son. Also Thursday, the Philippine police reported that 142 of the wanted suspects are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g5PaswjvZLTTAbzBn2sgdZefz9lg">still at large</a> [AP report]. The arrest orders were <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032500219.html">issued</a> [WP report] only a day before the campaign period for the May 2011 parliamentary elections kicks off.<br /><br />Last month, the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the November 2009 killings. Among those charged was Andal Ampatuan Sr., a former political ally to Philippine <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">profile</a>]. In December, the PDOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of more than 600 people charged with rebellion for allegedly interfering with government operations following the killings. Several of Ampatuan Sr.&#39;s sons, including Andal Ampatuan Jr., the mayor of the southern Philippine town of Datu Unsay, have also been charged. Ampatuan Jr. has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/philippines-mayor-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 41 counts of murder. Following the killings, Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> in the province. She later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-lifts-martial-law.php">lifted the conditions</a>, following <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/rights-group-urges-philippines.php">international  pressure</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/some-philippines-judges-want-high-court.php">domestic legal challenges</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] voted <a href="http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00105">56 to 43</a> [roll call] to pass a modified version of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR4872:">Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010</a> [HR 4872 materials] Thursday, after certain language in the original bill was altered to fix parliamentary problems highlighted by Republicans.  The bill will now be sent back to the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] for a final vote on the new language. Democratic leaders stated that the alterations, which involved student-lending legislation attached to health care bill, were minimal and should easily pass through the lower chamber. All Senate Republicans and three Democrats voted against the bill, but it still passed because <a href="http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/crsbackground/byrdrule.html">budget reconciliation bills</a> [Senate backgrounder] require only a simple majority, rather than the standard 60-member super-majority, to advance. The House vote is slated for Thursday evening.<br /><br />US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> the original bill into law on Tuesday after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-passes-health-care-reform.php">passed by the House</a> [JURIST reports] by a vote of 219 - 212. He has since signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-acts-consistency-with-longst">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-executive-order-limiting.php">report</a>] continuing a prohibition on the use of federal funds for <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] except in cases of rape or incest or where a woman&#39;s life would be endangered, as part of a compromise with conservative Democrats. The same day that the original bill was signed into law, the attorneys general (AGs) for 13 states filed suit in federal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">challenging the constitutionality of the new law</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, Idaho Governor CL Otter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill banning a federal mandate that citizens purchase health insurance. Earlier in March, the Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Bob McDonald has indicated he will sign. The AGs who filed suit Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/gop-state-ags-threaten-legal-action.php">originally threatened</a> the action in December, after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-approves-health-care-reform-bill.php">Senate passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] of the health care overhaul bill.<br /><br />9:30 PM ET - The House <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll194.xml">voted 220-207</a> [roll call] to approve the bill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> on Thursday announced <a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1436">changes to the enforcement</a> [press release] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don&#39;t Ask Don&#39;t, Tell</a> [10 USC &sect; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Don%27t+ask%2Cdon%27t+tell">news archive</a>] policy to make it more difficult to expel openly gay service members from the military. The changes, set to take effect immediately, include raising the level of who can initiate and conduct investigations, revising what constitutes credible information to initiate an investigation, and revising what constitutes a &quot;reliable person&quot; for initiating an investigation. Gates believes that these changes provide:<br /><blockquote><br />a greater measure of common sense and common decency to a process for handling what are difficult and complex issues for all involved. Of course, only Congress can repeal the current &quot;Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell&quot; statute. It remains the law, and we are obligated to enforce it. At the same time, these changes will allow us to execute the law in a fairer and more appropriate manner.<br /></blockquote><br />The armed services have 30 days to conform their regulations to these new standards, which will be in effect until the repeal of Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell.<br /><br />Last week, retired US Marine Corps General <a href="http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Whos_Who/Sheehan_JJ.htm">John Sheehan</a> [official profile] testified before the US Senate that he believes the Dutch military&#39;s inclusion of openly gay soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/retired-us-general-tells-senate.php">weakened their military</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/DADT_Bill.pdf">Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bill-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the Senate, which would allow gay soldiers to serve openly. US President Barack Obama has made clear that repealing the controversial policy is a top priority for his administration, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">pledging to end it</a> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">reiterating his commitment</a> [JURIST reports] in the State of the Union address. In January, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pentagon-lawyers-advise-waiting-to.php">advised to delay</a> [JURIST report] any internal efforts to repeal the policy until 2011. In 2008, more than 100 retired admirals and generals of the US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/retired-top-military-officers-call-for.php">called for a repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the policy.

		<title>France to propose law banning full face veil in public: Sarkozy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/accueil/">President Nicholas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French] said Wednesday that the government will introduce legislation to <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/documents/index.php?lang=fr&mode=view&cat_id=1&press_id=3476">ban traditional Muslim face veils</a> [transcript, in French; <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/webtv/a-l-elysee/declaration-du-president-a-l-issue-du-conseil-des-ministres-video-8-1606.html">video</a>, in French] in public places. Sarkozy&#39;s announcement comes weeks after a French parliamentary commission charged with investigating whether to enact laws banning the wearing of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqas</a> [JURIST news archive] or other &quot;full veils&quot; released its <a href="/pdf/rapportviole.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; in French] calling for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-parliamentary-commission.php">partial ban</a> [JURIST report] that would apply in public facilities, including hospitals, schools, and public transportation, and to any individual attempting to receive public services. Sarkozy supported the commission&#39;s suggestions, saying:<br /><blockquote><br />The full veil is contrary to the dignity of women. The answer is to ban the full veil. The government will introduce a bill to ban consistent with the general principles of our law.<br /></blockquote><br />While many people in France <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/26/france.burqa.ban/">approve of the proposed legislation</a> [CNN report], such measures have also <a href="/hotline/2010/02/proposed-french-ban-on-burqas-alienates.php">faced opposition</a> [JURIST comment] from critics who say such a law would alienate France&#39;s Muslim minority and violate the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], of which France is a signatory. Sarkozy did not give details about when or how the proposed law would take effect. <br /><br />Also this week, lawmakers in Quebec introduced a bill that would <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/785036--quebec-niqab-bill-makes-women-unveil-to-get-public-services">ban women wearing full face veils from public services</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Star</span> report], such as receiving care at a hospital or going to a public university. Supporters of the bill, such as the <a href="http://www.muslimcanadiancongress.org/">Muslim Canadian Congress</a> [advocacy website], argue that the proposed law would <a href="/hotline/2010/02/canada-should-consider-burka-ban-as.php">not violate human rights</a> [JURIST comment] and would promote the ideals of a free and democratic society. Others say the bill only discriminates against Muslims while allowing for other types religious clothing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201003/25/espana/20100325elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.doc">denied</a> [order, DOC; in Spanish] an appeal by National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>], ruling that he may be formally charged for exceeding his jurisdictional authority. The five-judge panel <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Supremo/da/luz/verde/Varela/sentar/Garzon/banquillo/investigar/crimenes/franquismo/elpepuesp/20100325elpepunac_16/Tes">upheld</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] the ability to review Garzon&#39;s actions related to his <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into war crimes allegedly committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] during the <a href="http://unx1.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/SpanCW.html">Spanish Civil War</a> [LOC backgrounder]. In October 2008, Garzon ordered the exhumation of 19 mass graves in Spain and ordered government agencies and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves in order to assemble a definitive national registry, despite a 1977 amnesty decree. The decision on whether to pursue charges is now returned to the same judge that issued a February ruling that Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-court-rules-judge-garzon-may-have.php">may have violated</a> [JURIST report] the amnesty law. If charged and convicted, Garzon could face disbarment. He maintains that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times.<br /><br />The Supreme Court originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-high-court-to-hear-challenge.php">allowed the investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Garzon&#39;s actions in May as a result of a complaint filed by <a href="http://www.manoslimpias.es/">Manos Limpias</a> [group website, in Spanish], a union of public servants in Spain that alleged Garzon acted in violation of <a href="http://www.policias.org/legis/cp21.htm">Penal Code Article 446</a> [text, in Spanish] when he began his probe into the crimes committed by the Franco regime.  Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile cases, including those against <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives]. In January, Garzon announced he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-garzon-beginning.php">begin an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the suspected torture and ill-treatment of detainees held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Obama administration has not responded to Garzon&#39;s questions regarding the open investigation of detainee abuses at the facility. Garzon&#39;s inquiry has focused on Spanish citizen and ex-Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/05/spain.terror.conviction/index.html">Ahmed Abderraman Hamed</a> [CNN report], and three others whom Garzon has said have significant connections with Spain. The domestic focus is due to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">recently passed laws</a> [JURIST report] that limit the use of universal jurisdiction to offenses committed by or against Spaniards, or where the perpetrators are in Spain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladesh officials on Thursday announced the establishment of a special war crimes tribunal that will hear cases against individuals accused of war crimes during the 1971 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. According to <a href="http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/hministeroffice.htm">Law Minister Shafique Ahmed</a> [official profile], the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iCOliPJ-DYQL851nhc2Vgo0H0pNAD9ELL8JG0">tribunal will include</a> [AP report] three high court judges and six investigators retired from civilian, law enforcement, and military careers. The trials investigating the 1971 war crimes will take place under the recently amended <a href="http://bdlaws.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?act_name=&vol=&id=435">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973</a> [text]. Officials estimate that Pakistani soldiers and local militia participated in more than three million killings and 200,000 rapes.  <br /><br />On Monday, the <a href="http://www.cabinet.gov.bd/index.php?lang=en">Bangladesh Cabinet</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-cabinet-ratifies-icc-treaty.php">ratified the Rome Statute</a> [JURIST report] of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Although the ratification will not directly affect Bangladesh&#39;s pending war crimes trials for the 1971 Liberation War because the ICC can only hear cases arising since its formation in 2002, it will require the country to update its laws to reflect provisions of the statute. Last month, the Bangladeshi government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/bangladesh-to-appoint-prosecutors-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the prosecutors and investigators for the country&#39;s war crimes tribunal should be appointed in March. In July, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [BBC profile] to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/bangladesh-urged-to-improve-war-crimes.php">improve war crimes laws</a> [JURIST report] to bring justice to victims of the 1971 war. Last April, the UN agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/bangladesh-exploring-trial-of-1971-war.php">advise</a> [JURIST report] the Bangladeshi government on the organization and operation of the tribunal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] on Thursday adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/d_res_dec/A_HRC_13_L_1.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF] condemning <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=religious+defamation">religious defamation</a> [JURIST news archive]. The non-binding resolution, proposed by Pakistan, passed with a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9942&LangID=E">vote of 20-17</a> [press release], with eight abstentions. The resolution has long been sought by Muslim countries, which claim that Muslims have faced discrimination, especially since the 9/11 attacks on the US. The resolution states that the council:<blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">Strongly condemns</span> all manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and migrants and the stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges all States to apply and, where required, reinforce existing laws when such xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions occur, in order to deny impunity for those who commit such acts;</blockquote>The resolution also contained a provision condemning Switzerland&#39;s recent <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/switzerland-voters-approve-ban-on.php">ban on the construction of minarets</a> [JURIST report]. Western nations have expressed concern that the resolution could be used to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE52P60220090326">justify restrictions on free speech</a> [Reuters report].<br /><br />In November, the <a href="http://www.oic-oci.org/home.asp">Organization of the Islamic Conference</a> (OIC) [official website] began lobbying the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to pass an <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/islamic-countries-lobbying-for-treaty.php">international treaty</a> [JURIST report] protecting religious beliefs and symbols from defamation. The efforts of the OIC are being led by Pakistan and Algeria with full support of the organization&#39;s 54 remaining members. The US government has openly condemned the idea of a bar on defamation of religion, which it claims could have the adverse affect of suppressing dissidents and reformists in Muslim countries. In October, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-report-criticizes-islamic-nations-on.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/index.htm">Report on International Religious Freedom</a> [materials], criticizing Islamic countries for limiting religious expression. The report found that countries such as North Korea and Iran have attempted to prevent religious defamation as a way to limit religious expression. <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/10/130937.htm">said</a> [transcript] that freedom of religion is essential not only in the US but in every society, and limiting an individual&#39;s right of expression reduces that freedom.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf//content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5427903252658471225">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that limiting contributions from individuals to independent political advocacy organizations is unconstitutional.  The court relied on  the Supreme Court&#39;s recent decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">eased restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on political and campaign spending by corporations on First Amendment grounds.  The <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website] contended that the <u>Citizens United</u> ruling was not applicable because it involved expenditure limits as opposed to contribution limits.  The court rejected this argument and found the latter to be in violation of the First Amendment, saying:<blockquote>Because <u>Citizens United</u> holds that independent expenditures do not corrupt or give the appearance of corruption as a matter of law, then the government can have no anti-corruption interest in limiting contributions to independent expenditure-only organizations. No matter which standard of review governs contribution limits, the limits on contributions to [political advocacy groups] cannot stand.</blockquote>Prior to the ruling, donations to such organizations could not exceed $5,000 from any one person.  The decision also upheld reporting and organizational requirements on the basis that the public has a valid interest in knowing the sources of a group&#39;s funding.<br /><br />President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/white-house-presses-critique-of-high.php">sharply criticized</a> the Supreme Court&#39;s holding in <u>Citizens United</u>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">most notably</a> [JURIST reports] in his 2010 State of the Union address. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. <u>Citizen&#39;s United</u> overturned Section 203 of the BCRA, which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] on the effects of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Friday adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.15 materials] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9944&LangID=E">condemning Myanmar for rights violations</a> [press release] and urging the ruling junta to conduct fair and free elections. The UNHRC also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34218&Cr=myanmar&Cr1=">extended the mandate</a> [UN News Centre report] for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, for an additional year. Friday&#39;s resolution comes after several UN member states declared Thursday that Myanmar must release all political prisoners, including pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. The statement was adopted during a meeting of the &quot;Group of Friends of Myanmar,&quot; organized by UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon. During the meeting, developments in Myanmar, including the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-election-laws-do-not-meet.php">adoption of new election laws</a> [JURIST report] that bar Suu Kyi from running in the upcoming election, were discussed. The &quot;Group of Friends of Myanmar&quot; <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20100325/tap-myanmar-diplomacy-un-2a5be5e.html">include</a> [AFP report] Australia, Britain, China, the European Union, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.<br /><br />Earlier this week, Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit to repeal the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">election laws</a> [JURIST report] filed by Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website]. In February, Myanmar&#39;s Supreme Court dismissed Suu Kyi&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-top-court-hears-latest-suu-kyi.php">latest appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the 18-month extension of her house arrest. Suu Kyi <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/suu-kyi-appeals-house-arrest-to-myanmar.php">appealed to the high court</a> in November after a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/myanmar-court-finds-suu-kyi-guilty-of.php">found her guilty</a> [JURIST reports] of violating the terms of her house arrest when she allowed an American to stay with her after he swam across a lake to her home. Suu Kyi, who has been in prison or under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, will be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/myanmar-official-says-suu-kyi-to-be.php">released in November</a> [JURIST report], according to a government official, likely after the upcoming elections have taken place.

The <a href="http://www.lbh-apik.or.id/uu-pornografi.htm">law</a> [text, in Bahasa] was purportedly designed to protect younger generations from pornographic and lewd materials. Critics challenged the bill for being too broad, discriminating against women, and targeting aspects of Indonesian tradition and culture, but the court rejected those arguments. Some areas of Indonesia, such as Bali, have <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36034943/ns/world_news/">refused to enforce the law</a> [AP report]. While Indonesia is officially secular, it is the world&#39;s largest Muslim country by population, and some areas are ruled by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia">Sharia law</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.dpr.go.id/">Indonesian Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/indonesia-parliament-passes-broad-anti.php">passed the law</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, criminalizing all &quot;obscene&quot; works and &quot;bodily movements&quot; that could violate public morality. Proponents of the law included <a href="http://www.presidensby.info/index.php/eng/index.html">President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3725301.stm">profile</a>] and his administration, who claimed that the law would protect Islam and cultural art while eradicating pornography.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] has called on Uzbekistan to carry out an independent investigation into the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4550845.stm">May 2005 Andijan clashes</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Andijan">news archive</a>] between Uzbek protesters, soldiers  and police that human rights groups claim <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/rights-group-accuses-uzbek-government.php">killed up to 500 people</a> [JURIST report]. Uzbek officials have officially put the death toll at 173.  The Committee&#39;s <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/co/Uzbekistan98_AUV.doc">report</a> [text] comes a week before a visit by UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website]. The report urges Uzbekistan to comply with previous recommendations and supply the Committee with information regarding Uzbek laws on use of firearms by police against civilians, stating: <blockquote>[T]he Committee is concerned at the absence of a comprehensive and fully independent investigation on the exact circumstances of the events during which several hundreds of civilians, including women and children, were killed by the military and security services. It also notes with regret that [Uzbekistan] has not provided the requested information regarding the national rules on the use of firearms by security forces against civilians. [Uzbekistan] should conduct a fully independent investigation and ensure that those responsible for the killings of persons in the Andijan events are prosecuted and, if found guilty, punished, and that victims and their relatives are given full compensation.</blockquote> The Committee also expressed concern over Uzbek laws and practices regarding torture, the treatment of refugees, the rights of suspected terrorists, judicial independence, and gender discrimination. Despite this, the Committee praised Uzbekistan&#39;s abolition of the death penalty, the introduction of habeas corpus, and the steps that have been taken by the government to combat child labor and human trafficking.<br /><br />Friday&#39;s report is the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26208106">first to be issued</a> [Reuter report] on Uzbekistan by the Human Rights Committee since the Andijan clashes, which were sparked when <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/uzbekistan-trial-of-muslim-businessmen.php">thousands of protesters gathered</a> [JURIST report] after rebels stormed a prison and freed a group of businessmen on trial for alleged Islamic extremism. The Committee is a panel of experts which meets three times a year to monitor compliance with the 1966 UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] by <a href="http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-4&chapter=4&lang=en">ratifying states</a> [list], of which Uzbekistan has been a member since 1995. The <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] announced in October that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/eu-lifts-final-sanctions-against.php">lifting the final sanctions</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:300:0055:0055:EN:PDF">text</a>, PDF] imposed upon the country in November 2005 in the wake of the Andijan clashes. The sanctions were imposed due to the refusal to investigate the violent suppression of a protest of economic conditions in Andijan. The sanctions included suspending a cooperation accord, imposing an arms embargo, cutting aid to the country, and banning some Uzbek officials from traveling to Western Europe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Zimbabwean <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morgan+Tsvangirai">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] agreed at belated International Women&#39;s Day Celebrations on Friday that gay rights <a href="http://news.iafrica.com/worldnews/2324080.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+iafrica%252FuGIK+%2528iafrica.com+world+news%2529">should not be constitutionally protected</a> [AFP report]. While Zimbabwean &quot;sexual deviancy&quot; laws prohibit homosexual acts, some lawmakers have suggested that drafts of Zimbabwe&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/zimbabwe-constitution-project-suspended.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report] decriminalize homosexual acts. Tsvangirai and Mugabe <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8588548.stm">rejected</a> [BBC report] such proposals, stating that the current law serves to promote unions between men and women. The leaders&#39; agreement signaled a rare alignment of opinion in what has become a contentious power-sharing arrangement.<br /><br />Last year, the Zimbabwean parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/zimbabwe-parliament-forms.php">formed a committee</a> to draft a new constitution as part of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST reports] between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. It was hoped that a draft of the new constitution would be <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-04-13-zim-sets-up-committee-to-draft-new-constitution">completed by this February</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Guardian</span> report] so that it could be decided upon via referendum in July and adopted by the end of the year. Zimbabwe last attempted a constitutional referendum in 2000, though it was rejected due to concerns about the extent of power that would be given to Mugabe. Once the constitution is ratified, Tsvangirai targets 2011 for a presidential election.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] said Thursday that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) would appeal a judge&#39;s order to release a Guantanamo Bay detainee suspected of involvement in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=9/11">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] World Trade Center attacks. In a decision released Monday, <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] Judge James Robinson had <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the <em>habeas corpus</em> petition of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, ordering his release.  Slahi has been accused of recruiting for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> in Germany and ultimately helping alleged hijackers <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohammed+atta">Mohammed Atta</a> [JURIST news archives], Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al Sehhi find training in Afghanistan. The prosecution believes that Slahi had a &quot;significant&quot; role in planning the 9/11 attacks and sought the death penalty, but a key prosecutor, Lt. Col. Stuart Couch, stepped down from the case after it was revealed that <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">&quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; had been used</a> [Senate Armed Services Committee report, PDF] to compel his confessions. Robinson&#39;s opinion is currently classified, but is expected to be publicly released at a later date.<br /><br />Last year, the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/canada-court-rejects-guantanamo.php">dismissed an application</a> [JURIST report] by Slahi requesting access to records of interrogations conducted by the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) and the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/index-eng.htm">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) [official websites] both in Canada and at Guantanamo Bay.  Slahi had sought the release of records to corroborate his allegations of mistreatment at Guantanamo Bay as part of his <em>habeas</em> petition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military judge Friday denied a motion to dismiss charges against US Marine <a href="http://www.frankwuterich.com/">Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wuterich">news archive</a>], the leader of the squad implicated in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5033648.stm">killing of 24 Iraqis</a> [BBC backgrounder] in <a href="http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforcent/Pages/LOAC/HadithaInvestigations.aspx">Haditha</a> [USMC case materials; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=hadith">news archive</a>] in November 2005. Lt. Col. David Jones <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100327/ap_on_re_us/us_marines_haditha_17">ruled</a> [AP report] that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that officers handling the case were improperly influenced by receiving information from an aide that had previously investigated the incident.  Per military policy, the aide&#39;s prior involvement barred him from participating in the decisions to file charges or initiate <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=court-martial">court-martial</a> [JURIST news archive] proceedings.  Jones found, however, that the officers overseeing both decisions conducted ample independent research before reaching their conclusions.  Wuterich&#39;s trial is now scheduled to begin September 13.<br /><br />Wuterich&#39;s court-martial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008 to allow prosecutors time to appeal a judge&#39;s decision to throw out a subpoena for unaired footage from a CBS interview with the Marine.  Wuterich was initially charged with unpremeditated murder, but the investigating officer <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/haditha-marine-squad-leader-should-not.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 that the more serious charge be dropped. Of the eight Marines initially charged in connection to the Haditha incident, all but Wuterich have either had their charges dismissed or been found not guilty.  Charges against <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=chessani">Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani</a> [JURIST news archive] were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/military-judge-drops-charges-against-us.php">dropped</a> in June 2008, a decision that was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/military-appeals-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> the following March [JURIST reports].  Also in June 2008, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andrew+grayson">1st Lt. Andrew Grayson</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-marine-cleared-of-all-charges-in.php">cleared on all counts</a>, including charges that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/haditha-killings-photo-evidence-ordered.php">ordered a subordinate officer to delete photographic evidence</a> [JURIST reports] of the killings.  In August 2007, all charges against Lance Cpl. Justin Sharratt and Capt. Randy W. Stone were <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/charges-dismissed-against-two-us.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report].  An official report on the Haditha incident by US Army Major General Eldon Bargewell found <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/haditha-inquiry-finds-serious.php">&quot;serious misconduct&quot;</a> [JURIST report] at all levels of the US Marine Corps chain of command.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=13405">appointed</a> [press release] retired <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Navy Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] as the convening authority for <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Considered an expert in military law, MacDonald&#39;s experience as a former Navy judge advocate general played a significant role in the appointment process. MacDonald replaces Susan Crawford, a Bush administration appointee. The position was created under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF] to oversee military commissions themselves, such as those at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], and also to oversee the Office of Military Commissions. Notably, the convening authority has the power to review and approve charges against &quot;belligerents,&quot; pursuant to the Military Commissions Act.<br /><br />The appointment may indicate that the Obama administration is planning to try accused 9/11 conspirators, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC Profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] in a military trial rather than in civilian criminal court, as <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] had originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to try the suspected terrorists in civilian court. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], a group that has been persistent in its advocacy of civilian trials for the 9/11 suspects, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/attorney-general-holder-defends-decision-try-911-suspects-federal-court">expressed support</a> [press release] for Holder&#39;s decision. Earlier this month, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after reports that White House advisers are <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system.

Gao, who had been missing for more than a year, said he had been released last year and that he wanted to &quot;live a quiet life for a while.&quot; Another Chinese human rights lawyer, Li Heping, said that he had also spoken to Gao and confirmed his identity. Gao still appeared to be under some form of restraint in his interview, however, since he would not give details of his location nor did he answer any detailed questions about his current situation.<br /><br />Gao drew international attention in September 2007 when he wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/chinese-lawyer-detained-for-sending.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to the US Congress requesting assistance in improving human rights in China. Gao, who has also defended Christians and coal miners in China, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/14/world/AP-AS-China-Missing-Lawyer.html?_r=2">claimed that he was tortured</a> [AP report] after being arrested earlier that year 2007. He was originally part of the Chinese Communist Party and handled prominent cases involving the outlawed <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong movement</a> [Falun Dafa website], but fell into disfavor with the government in 2006 when he was <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gao+zhisheng">convicted of subversion</a> [JURIST report] and placed under house arrest. Gao had been most recently detained since February 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chinese court on Monday convicted four employees of Australian mining company <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> [corporate website] of receiving bribes and stealing commercial secretes. Rio Tinto&#39;s Shanghai manager, Australian national Stern Hu, and three Chinese colleagues were sentenced to between seven and 14 years in prison for accepting around USD $13.5 million in bribes and using &quot;improper means&quot; to gain secret commercial information that gave the company an advantage when bargaining with China over the importation of steel. The court concluded that Chinese companies <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-03/29/c_13229214.htm">paid an additional 1.02 billion yuan</a> (USD $150 million) [Xinhua report] for steel last year because of the actions the four men. Rio Tinto said they were <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/media/18435_media_releases_19133.asp">unable to comment</a> [press release] on the conviction for stealing commercial secrets because that portion of the trial was held in a closed court. The statement also condemned the actions of the men and indicated they would be fired, stating:<br /><blockquote><br />Receiving bribes is a clear violation of Chinese law and Rio Tinto&#39;s code of conduct, The Way We Work. We have been informed of the clear evidence presented in court that showed beyond doubt that the four convicted employees had accepted bribes. By doing this they engaged in deplorable behaviour that is totally at odds with our strong ethical culture. In accordance with our policies we will terminate their employment.<br /></blockquote><br />The company also denied any internal wrongdoing in relation to the charges. In its ruling, the court indicated that at least two Chinese officials would be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/business/global/30riotinto.html">charged with passing the commercial secrets</a> [NYT report] to Rio Tinto. <br /><br />Hu and the three other defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/china-detains-australia-mining-company.php">accused last July</a> [JURIST report] of stealing &quot;state secrets&quot; during stalled iron ore price negotiations. One month before the men were detained, Chinese lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-lawmakers-review-revised-state.php">considered</a> [JURIST report] a revised version of the country&#39;s sweeping <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+state+secrets">state secrets</a> [JURIST news archive] law to address Internet leaks of classified data. In June 2007, <a href="http://hrichina.org/public/index">Human Rights in China</a> [advocacy website] said that the state secrets system in China gives the government virtually <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/china-state-secrets-system-undermining.php">complete power to halt the free flow of information</a> [JURIST report], &quot;undermining healthy governance and rule of law.&quot; In November 2006, Hong Kong reporter <a href="http://www.chingcheong.com/">Ching Cheong</a> [advocacy website, in Chese] began a <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/china-court-sentences-singapore.php">five-year prison term</a> for passing state secrets to Taiwanese intelligence, after the Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/chinese-reporter-loses-appeal-of-state.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST reports] the sentence on appeal. He was <a href="http://www.chingcheong.com/news_080206_4.htm">released</a> [press release, in Chinese] in 2008 after serving half of the sentence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Obama administration on Friday defended the legality of its use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drone">unmanned predator drone strikes</a> [JURIST news archive]. <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department Legal Adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] explained the administration&#39;s legal rationale in a <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/139119.htm">speech</a> [text] to the <a href="http://www.asil.org/">American Society of International Law</a> [official website], saying the strikes &quot;comply with all applicable law.&quot; Koh said the drone strikes fit the administration&#39;s principles governing targeting practices because the principle of distinction limits targeting for military objectives and not civilians or civilian structures, and the principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that will cause too much incidental death or injury to civilians or destruction of civilian objects in relation to the advantage of the military objective. Koh further explained that because international law allows a country to use lethal force to defend itself, the drone strikes cannot be considered &quot;unlawful extrajudicial killings.&quot; Koh said the Obama administration is &quot;committed&quot; to ensuring its targeting practices are lawful but that:<br /><blockquote><br />recent events have shown, Al Qaeda has not abandoned its intent to attack the United States, and indeed continues to attack us. Thus, in this ongoing armed conflict, the United States has the authority under international law, and the responsibility to its citizens, to use force, including lethal force, to defend itself, including by targeting persons such as high-level al Qaeda leaders who are planning attacks. </blockquote><br /><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,0,0" width="400" height="264" ><param name="flashvars" value="webhost=fora.tv&clipid=10561&cliptype=highlight" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"  /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="movie" value="http://fora.tv/embedded_player" /><embed flashvars="webhost=fora.tv&clipid=10561&cliptype=highlight" src="http://fora.tv/embedded_player" width="400" height="264" allowScriptAccess="always" allowFullScreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed></object><br /><br />There has been growing criticism for the use of unmanned drones. Last week, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-information-on.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] seeking information related to the US government&#39;s use of unmanned drones. The ACLU alleges that the drones have been used by the military and CIA for unlawful killings in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The ACLU also cites troubling reports indicating that US citizens may be targeted and killed by unmanned drones. In October, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] noted that the use of unmanned drones by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Alston said, &quot;[t]he onus is really on the government of the United States to reveal more about the ways in which it makes sure that arbitrary executions, extrajudicial executions, are not in fact being carried out through the use of these weapons.&quot;  Alston criticized the US policy in a report to the UN General Assembly&#39;s human rights committee that was presented as part of a larger demand that no state be free from accountability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] released information Friday on hundreds of people tried and convicted in federal courts on charges related to international terrorism since 9/11. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/nsd/">National Security Division</a> (NSD) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/cjs/docs/terrorism-convictions-statistics.pdf">chart</a> [text, PDF] has been maintained since the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 2001 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], and includes the name, charges, and sentences of 403 people, according to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/cjs/docs/terrorism-crimes-letter.html">letter</a> [text] describing its contents. The chart divides the list into two categories. The first, including 159 names, comprises those convicted of crimes directly related to international terrorism, such as the use of weapons of mass destruction or terrorist acts against US nationals. The second category, including 244 names, is made up of those convicted of crimes not directly related to international terrorism, but with demonstrable links to it. In the letter, addressed to Chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) and Ranking Member <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/public/">Jeff Sessions</a> (R-AL) of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, Assistant Attorney General for the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ola/">Office of Legislative Affairs</a> [official websites] Ronald Weich explained the inclusion of the second category and outlined the benefits of federal trials: <blockquote>Prosecuting terror-related targets using [the] ... offenses [in the second category] is often an effective method ... of deterring and disrupting potential terrorist planning and support activities. Indeed, one of the great strengths of the criminal justice system is the broad range of offenses that are available to arrest and convict individuals believed to be linked to terrorism, even if a terrorism offense cannot be established. ... Arresting and convicting both major and minor operatives, supporters, and facilitators can have crippling effects on terrorists&#39; ability to carry out their plans.</blockquote> Sessions has been <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressShop.NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=9c0cc391-e6c3-babd-b721-621a2b775397&Region_id=&Issue_id=">highly critical</a> [press release] of the composition of the NSD chart, noting that few of the convicts included on the list have committed acts on the level of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], the alleged 9/11 planner, and noted problems with the criminal prosecution of terror suspects. Sessions explained: <blockquote>The great majority of the terrorism cases cited ... are in no way comparable to [that of Mohammed]. Most of the convictions in this list are for far lesser offenses, such as document fraud and immigration violations, while only a small handful concern conduct even remotely similar to a mass-casualty terrorist attack. ... Among the cases cited is that of Zacarias Moussaoui, which was fraught with procedural problems, delays, appeals, risks to classified evidence, and even a lone holdout juror who spared the 20th hijacker the death penalty. Due to gaps in federal law, many of the problems prosecutors encountered in the Moussaoui trial will be experienced in future terrorism trials.</blockquote> In addition to <a href="/currentawareness/moussaoui.php">Zaccarias Moussaoui</a>, those listed in the first category include <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Headley">David Headley</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Najibullah+Zazi">Najibullah Zazi</a> [JURIST news archives], and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1729472.stm">Richard Reid</a> [BBC profile].<br /><br />The Obama administration has faced intense criticism over its plans to try those held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> and others accused of terrorist acts in federal courts, as opposed to the <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] favored by the previous administration. Two weeks ago, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website], appearing before a <a href="http://appropriations.house.gov/">House Appropriations</a> [official website] subcommittee, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">defended his intention to try</a> [JURIST report] suspected terrorists, including Mohammed, in federal court.  In January, New York University&#39;s <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/index.cfm">Center on Law and Security</a> [official website] found that federal courts have had an <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-courts-effective-in-prosecuting.php">89 percent conviction rate</a> [JURIST report] in terrorism cases since 2001.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for former Thai  Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] claimed Friday that the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] had <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/35038/thaksin-files-for-new-assets-trial">wrongfully</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] ordered the seizure of assets belonging to Thaksin and asked for a reconsideration of his case. Noppadon Pattama, Thaksin&#39;s legal advisor, said that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/27/2857757.htm?section=justin">new evidence had come to light</a> [AFP report] showing that Thaksin did not abuse his power while in office to benefit himself. Lawyers for Thaksin&#39;s children are expected to file separate appeals against the ruling. A five-judge Supreme Court panel will <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/03/25/politics/Thaksin-to-appeal-asset-seizure-citing-fresh-evide-30125521.html">decide</a> [<em>The Nation</em> report] whether to accept the appeal. <br /><br />The Thai Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/thailand-court-seizes-assets-from.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last month that Thaksin was guilty of using his power in office to personally benefit himself and other family members. The Court ordered that $1.4 billion of his estimated $2.2 billion fortune be seized. The court <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/169861/thaksin-assets-partly-confiscated">found</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] that Thaksin crafted government telecommunications policy to benefit his family by providing them with shares in <a href="http://www.shincorp.com/index_en.asp">Shin Corporation</a> [corporate website]. The shares were then sold just three days after the the government raised the maximum foreign ownership of telecommunication companies from 20 percent to 49 percent. Thaksin has <a href="http://www.thaksinlive.com/2010/02/headlines/722">claimed</a> [statement] that all of his wealth was obtained legitimately. Thaksin was also convicted <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span> on corruption charges related to a land purchase and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison. Thai officials have <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-officials-deny-thaksin.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] claims that the country&#39;s judiciary is biased against the former prime minister.

Judge Patti Saris also ordered Albert Gonzalez to pay $25,000 and serve three years of probation. Gonzalez <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/Press%20Office%20-%20Press%20Release%20Files/Dec2009/DOJNJPleaPR.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] in December to conspiring to hack into computer networks and stealing financial information relating to tens of millions of credit and debit cards. Gonzalez is reported to have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/ptech/03/24/secret.service.hacker/index.html">worked as an informant</a> [CNN report] for bank card thefts for the <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/">US Secret Service</a> [official website] before he was arrested in 2008.<br /><br />The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [DOJ] originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/doj-indicts-3-in-largest-identity-theft.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] Gonzalez along with two unidentified Russian hackers for wire fraud and conspiracy. He was accused of stealing more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers by hacking into computer systems of companies including credit card payment processor Heartland Payment Systems, convenience store chain 7-Eleven, and supermarket chain Hannaford Brothers. Gonzalez was charged in May 2008 in the Eastern District of New York and in August 2008 in the District of Massachusetts in separate conspiracies. Friday&#39;s sentencing addressed both sets of charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1953-102">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that the <a href="http://GOP.com">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC) [committee website] cannot raise &quot;soft money&quot; to use in state elections. &quot;Soft money&quot; refers to contributions beyond the ceilings imposed by <a href="/currentawareness/campaignfinance.php">campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive] laws. The case tests the limits of the Supreme Court&#39;s recent decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">eased restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on political and campaign spending by corporations based on the First Amendment grounds. Specifically, the RNC tried to challenge Section 323(a) <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/bcra/bcra_update.shtml">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text] of 2002, which banned raising or spending &quot;soft money,&quot; defining it as donations greater than $30,400 during a federal campaign, and limited state and local campaigns from donations greater than $10,000 from any one donor. The RNC argued that since the money would be used for state campaign purposes, it did not fall under the restrictions of the 2002 ban. The court granted summary judgment for the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website], saying it was bound by the Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2003/2003_02_1674">McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Oyez backgrounder], which was partially overturned by <u>Citizens United</u>. However, the panel said <u>Citizens United</u> and campaign finance jurisprudence mean that Congress &quot;may impose some limits on contributions to federal candidates and political parties because of the <span style="font-style:italic;">quid pro quo</span> corruption or appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">quid pro quo</span> corruption that can be associated with such contributions.&quot; The case will likely be appealed could reach the Supreme Court.<br /><br />US President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/white-house-presses-critique-of-high.php">sharply criticized</a> the Supreme Court&#39;s holding in <u>Citizens United</u>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">most notably</a> [JURIST reports] in this year&#39;s State of the Union speech. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. <u>Citizen&#39;s United</u> overturned Section 203 of the BCRA, which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] on the effects of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1289-32">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that firearms<a href="http://www.dcwatch.com/council17/17-886.htm"> regulations</a> [text] in Washington DC, including a ban on assault weapons and a prohibition on <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/saws-and-lcafds.html#lcafd-ban">large capacity ammunition feeding devices</a> [ATF backgrounder], do not violate the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Second Amendment</a> [text]. The ruling by Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/urbina-bio.html">Ricardo M. Urbina</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] also upholds new registration rules that require a gun owner to submit fingerprints, photographs, and pay for a ballistics test. In upholding the regulations, Urbina cited the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report] which struck down an outright ban on handgun ownership in Washington DC nonetheless permitted the regulation of firearms. Urbina wrote:<blockquote>Because the [City] Council provided ample evidence of the ways in which the registration requirements will effectuate the goal of promoting public safety, and because public safety is a quintessential matter of public regulation, the court concludes that there is at least a substantial nexus between the registration requirements and the important governmental interest underlying those requirements. As a result, the court denies the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for summary judgment and grants the defendants&#8217; cross-motion for summary judgment on Count One of the second amended complaint.</blockquote>Urbina said the ban on assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices is constitutional because such devices &quot;fall outside the scope of the core second amendment right.&quot;  <a href="http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/profile.html">Stephen P. Halbrook</a> [firm profile], attorney for lead plaintiff <a href="http://www.hellerfoundation.org/Profiles.html">Dick Heller</a> [Heller Foundation profile], said that an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/26/AR2010032604527.html">appeal</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] is likely.<br /><br />The Supreme Court recently heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-gun.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/supreme-court-takes-gun-rights.php">report</a>] to determine whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the states, and not just the District of Columbia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Illinois <a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.net/">Cook County Circuit Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="http://www.thomasmoresociety.org/docs/2010/notice/Hope-Memorandum-Opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2103&ChapAct=750%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A070/&ChapterID=59&ChapterName=FAMILIES&ActName=Parental%20Notice%20of%20Abortion%20Act%20of%201995.">Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995</a> [text] is constitutional. While lifting the temporary restraining order on the law&#39;s enforcement, Judge Daniel Riley approved a 60-day grace period, preventing state officials from enforcing the law pending appeal procedures. The <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/index.shtml">American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois</a> (ACLU-IL) [advocacy website] brought suit last year arguing that the law violates privacy, due process, equal protection, and gender equality guaranteed by the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conmain.htm">Illinois Constitution</a> [text]. <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/news/press/2010/03/statement_of_colleen_k_connell_1.shtml">Responding to the judgment</a> [press release], ACLU-IL Executive Director Colleen Connell said:<br /><blockquote><br />In the wake of today&#39;s ruling, we are reviewing our legal options, including an appeal of the Judge&#39;s decision. We note that the Judge was careful and blunt in describing the Illinois law as &quot;unfortunate,&quot; and in noting that enforcement of the Act will result in horrible outcomes for some young women, including &quot;physical and emotional abuse.&quot; However, the Judge ruled in favor of the State because he did not believe that the law would be harmful in every incident where a pregnant minor was compelled to notify a parent of her decision to terminate a pregnancy. We will move swiftly to take all necessary action so that the real threat of abuse so clearly identified by the Judge can be avoided.<br /></blockquote><br />Anti-abortion advocate the <a href="http://www.thomasmoresociety.org/">Thomas More Society</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.thomasmoresociety.org/2010/0329/noticerelease/#more-686">commended the decision</a> [press release], stating that they looked forward &quot;toward ending underage secret abortions.&quot;<br /><br />Riley <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/illinois-court-again-delays-enforcement.php">granted the temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] in November, only hours after the Illinois Medical Disciplinary Board ruled to begin enforcing the law. The order was originally sought by the ACLU-IL in support of a suit brought by a local medical doctor and a women&#39;s clinic on behalf of themselves and their minor patients. ACLU-IL alleged that enforcement of the law would <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/news/press/2009/11/">cause major harm</a> [video] and compromise the privacy of some Illinois teen-aged women. The Illinois <a href="http://www.idfpr.com/">Department of Finance and Professional Regulation</a> (DFPR) [official website] granted doctors a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/illinois-gives-doctors-90-days-to.php">90-day grace period</a> [JURIST report] for enforcement of the parental notification requirement, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/7th-circuit-dissolves-injunction.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] that reversed a district court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-refuses-to-allow-illinois.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] barring the law&#39;s enforcement. The 1995 law, which has never been enforced, authorizes state judges to waive the notice requirement if doing so would be in a minor&#39;s best interest, but otherwise requires parental notification for minors seeking an abortion.

In a case brought by crewmembers of a Cambodian ship intercepted by French authorities under suspicion of carrying significant quantities of narcotics, the ECHR found that while the French government had violated the crewmembers&#39; right to liberty under Article 5.1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] by confining them to their quarters under guard for 13 days while still at sea, there was no violation of their Article 5.3 right to &quot;be brought promptly before a judge.&quot; The crewmembers were brought before investigating judges the same day they were brought on shore. The decision was <a href="http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/depeches/international/europe/20100329.FAP7017/la_france_condamnee_par_la_cedh_qui_ne_remet_plus_en_ca.html">much anticipated</a> [AP report, in French] in French political and judiciary circles, since it is seen as having implications for the French government&#39;s current project to <a href="/forumy/2009/09/reforming-criminal-procedure-in-france.php">reform French criminal procedure</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Opponents of the reform plan to substitute public prosecutors for traditional investigating judges had relied on ECHR case law to argue that such a move would compromise the right of the suspect to a fair and impartial investigation. French <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/index.php?rubrique=10016&ssrubrique=10019">Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie</a> [official profile, in French] has interpreted the decision as <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/index.php?rubrique=10016&ssrubrique=10259&article=19211">favorable</a> [press release, in French] to the proposed reform.<br /><br />The campaign for <a href="http://www.jeneparleraiquenpresencedemonavocat.fr/">criminal procedure reform</a> [advocacy website, in French] has gained momentum over the past few months as a result of other recent decisions by the ECHR in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=salduz%20|%20v%20|%20turkey&sessionid=47855883&skin=hudoc-en">Salduz v.

United States ex rel. Wilson</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-false.php">report</a>] that whistle-blowers cannot bring suit under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sec_31_00003729----000-.html">False Claims Act</a> [text] to recover misspent government funds if the information used in the lawsuits came from state or local agencies&#39; reports or audits. The suit arose out of public record documents that detailed a failure to obtain bids for the clean-up and reconstruction of storm-damaged portions of North Carolina. The petitioners claimed that the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/071322.P.pdf">concluding</a> [opinion, PDF] that a state audit does not constitute an administrative report, audit, or investigation under the Act. In reversing the decision below, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />Since its enactment during the Civil War, the False Claims Act has authorized both the Attorney General and private <span style="font-style:italic;">qui tam</span> relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. The Act now contains a provision barring <span style="font-style:italic;">qui tam</span> actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain specified sources. The question before us is whether the reference to &quot;administrative&quot; reports, audits, and investigations in that provision encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources. We hold that it does.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Antonin Scalia filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer.<br /><br />The ruling could potentially bar thousands of lawsuits by whistle-blowers. However, Congress recently <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/03/whistle-blower-defeat-short-lived/#more-18083">changed the language of the statute</a> [SCOTUSblog report] as part of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">health care reform bill</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last week. It is unclear whether the new wording will affect the case on remand.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Quezon City court on Monday dismissed rebellion charges against 24 people, including Andal Ampatuan Sr., the leader of a Muslim clan in the Philippines&#39; semi-autonomous southern province of Maguindanao, and four of his family members. The <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?id1=1">Philippines Department of Justice</a> [official website] had implicated Ampatuan and several of his followers in the November <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?rt=&tsq1=49">slayings</a> [press release] of 57 campaign workers, journalists, and supporters of family political rival Esmael Mangudadatu. Prosecutors claimed that in response to a police crackdown on the family following the massacre, Ampatuan, his three sons, his brother, and other members of his clan plotted to stage an armed rebellion against the Philippine government. Regional Trial Court judge Vivencio Baclig <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62S1SK20100329">cleared the rebellion charges</a> [Reuters report] against the Ampatuans and 19 others due to a lack of evidence. Acting Philippine Justice Secretary Alberto Agra said that the ruling would not effect the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">rebellion prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of more than 600 members of the Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans remain in custody awaiting trial on <a href="http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=538458&publicationSubCategoryId=63">57 counts of murder</a> [<em>Philippine Star</em> report].<br /><br />The Ampatuans and several of their followers are alleged to have intercepted Mangudadatu&#39;s convoy en route to declare his candidacy for governor at a regional election office, ultimately forcing his convoy to a remote hilltop where the Ampatuans&#39; group killed and buried them. Following the killings, <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended <font style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</font> in Maguindanao. She later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-lifts-martial-law.php">lifted the conditions</a>, following <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/rights-group-urges-philippines.php">international pressure</a> and domestic <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/some-philippines-judges-want-high-court.php">legal challenges</a> [JURIST reports].

Harris Associates</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>] that a shareholder does not have to show that a fund&#39;s investment adviser misled the fund&#39;s directors in order to have a cognizable claim of an excessive fee under &sect; 36(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvCoAct/index.html">Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/LN1FFRSK.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the claim is not cognizable unless the shareholder can show that the adviser misled the fund&#39;s directors who approved the fee. In vacating the decision below, the court adopted the <u>Gartenberg</u> standard, which provides that &quot;to face liability under &sect; 36(b), an investment adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm&#39;s length bargaining. Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<blockquote>By focusing almost entirely on the element of disclosure, the Seventh Circuit panel erred. The <u>Gartenberg</u> standard, which the panel rejected, may lack sharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately reflects the compromise that is embodied in &sect; 36(b), and it has provided a workable standard for nearly three decades. The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel and the dissent from the denial of rehearing regarding today&#39;s mutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the courts.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion.<br /><br />The case was brought by several plaintiffs who own shares in funds advised by <a href="http://www.harrisassoc.com/">Harris Associates</a> [corporate website]. The plaintiffs claimed that the fees were too high in violation of &sect; 36(b).

In televised remarks, Medvedev said: <blockquote>We need to focus on improving legislation aimed at preventing acts of terrorism, on the work of various departments charged with investigating such crimes, and on other procedures related to transportation security and safety of people in crowded places. I think we have reason to revisit issues related to the proper administration of justice under terrorist legislation &#8211; under the &#8216;terrorism&#8217; law and related crimes articles - and to talk about the need to improve such practices. </blockquote> <br /><embed src="http://www.1tv.ru/nvideo/163796" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" quality="high" width="322" height="288" allowScriptAccess="always"></embed><br /><br />Top Russian officials, including Medvedev, <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>], and head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) Aleksandr Bortnikov have <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Moscow_Metro_Rocked_By_Explosion/1996130.html">blamed insurgents from the North Caucasus</a> [RFE/RL report] for the subway bombings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar&#39;s largest opposition party, the <a href="http://www.nldla.net/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [party website], announced Monday that it will not participate in the nation&#39;s first elections in 20 years because of &quot;unjust&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-election-laws.php">election laws</a> [JURIST report]. A spokesperson for the NLD explained that the party had unanimously <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkveLB56JCzxoTWaW84FSrpY-W8QD9EO9BF80">decided not to register</a> [AP report] for the elections because they viewed the nation&#39;s electoral laws as &quot;undemocratic.&quot; Most notably, the Political Parties Registration Law <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">bars</a> [JURIST report] the NLD&#39;s leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] from participating in the election and prevents the NLD from participating if Suu Kyi remains the leader of the party. The NLD&#39;s refusal to take part in the elections could decrease the legitimacy of the elections in light of pressure on the current government to ensure that all groups are involved in the electoral process. <br /><br />Last week, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.15 materials] condemning Myanmar for rights violations and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-resolution-urges-fair-myanmar.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] the ruling junta to conduct fair and free elections. Also last week, the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-high-court-rejects-suu-kyi.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by the NLD to repeal the election laws preventing Suu Kyi from participating. Earlier this month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] said that the election laws <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-election-laws-do-not-meet.php">do not meet international standards</a> [JURIST report] for an inclusive political process, and the laws have also drawn criticism from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/10/burma-election-laws-may-shut-down-opposition-parties">said</a> [press release] &quot;[the new law] continues the sham political process that is aimed at creating the appearance of civilian rule with a military spine.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Gerechtshoven/s-Gravenhage/">The Hague Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Dutch] on Tuesday <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BL8979&u_ljn=BL8979">upheld</a> [judgment, in Dutch; <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Gerechtshoven/s-Gravenhage/Actualiteiten/Mothers+of+Srebrenica+cannot+sue+UN+for+compensatory+damages.htm">press release</a>] the UN&#39;s immunity from prosecution by rejecting claims brought by relatives of victims of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC timeline; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>] during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. The relatives, known as the Mothers of Srebrenica, alleged that the Netherlands should be liable for the deaths because Dutch soldiers operating under the UN flag negligently failed to protect civilians by forcing the victims out of a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/Res/819(1993)">UN-designated &quot;safe area&quot;</a> [resolution materials] and turning them over to Bosnian Serbs, resulting in the death of 8,000 Muslim men and boys. The court found that immunity is essential to the UN&#39;s ability to carry out its duties, and that the Dutch acting as UN peacekeepers could <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/srebrenica-relatives-case-against-un-rejected">not be held responsible</a> [RNW report]. The decision upheld the district court&#39;s 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hague-court-dismisses-srebrenica.php">decision to dismiss the claims</a> [JURIST report]. The Mothers of Srebrenica have vowed to appeal the case to the Netherlands Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice if necessary.<br /><br />Earlier this month, former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>], charged with committing war crimes during the Bosnian conflict, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website] to make his opening statements. Karadzic began by denying any plan to expel Muslims from Serbia, and blaming Muslims and Western countries for triggering the civil war. Karadzic also <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/karadzic-claims-attacks-on-bosnian.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Bosnians of planting corpses and embellishing reports about fatalities, calling the Srebrenica massacre a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/02/radovan-karadzic-siege-sarajevo-myth">farce</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] promulgated by Bosnian Muslims to incite hatred against Serbian forces. Karadzic is defending himself against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 counts</a> [amended indictment, PDF] including genocide and murder, and he faces life in prison if convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Some forms of online piracy in France are on the rise in spite of the recently passed <a href="http://www.senat.fr/dossierleg/pjl07-405.html">anti-piracy law</a> [legislative materials, in French; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=france+internet+piracy">news archive</a>], according to a March <a href="http://recherche.telecom-bretagne.eu/marsouin/IMG/pdf/NoteHadopix.pdf">study</a> [text, PDF; in French] conducted by the <a href="http://www.marsouin.org/">Marsouin Unit</a> [official website, in French] at the <a href="http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/home/">University of Rennes</a> [official website]. While 15 percent of individuals using Peer-to-Peer networking have stopped using such sites, Internet piracy has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/03/piracy-up-in-france-after-tough-three-strikes-law-passed.ars">increased by 3 percent</a> [Ars Technica report] since the law was passed, the study says. Much of the increase may attributable to the use of streaming technology and downloading sites not covered by the law. The new law has yet to take effect.<br /><br />Online piracy has assumed increasing importance in the eyes of legislators across Europe, as many countries, including the UK, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8569750.stm">consider legislation</a> [BBC report] that reflects the law enacted in France. The French bill was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-constitutional-court-approves.php">approved by the Constitutional Court</a> in October after being given final <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-parliament-gives-final-approval.php">approval by the French Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] the previous month. Under the so-called &quot;three strikes&quot; law, the French government could send notices to Internet service providers to terminate an individual&#39;s Internet access for up to one year after a third violation of intellectual property laws for downloading or sharing movies and music. One of the key reasons this version of the law was upheld by the court, after it <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/france-constitutional-court-rejects.php">struck down an earlier version</a> [JURIST report], is the requirement of judicial review prior to denial of Internet service.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The number of countries using the <a href="/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] continued to drop during 2009, according to an annual <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] published Monday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. According to the report, more than 700 people were executed last year in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the US. Regionally, the majority of executions occurred in Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, while the US was the only country in the Americas to execute prisoners last year. AI&#39;s figures <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/death-penalty-report-china-must-end-secrecy-surrounding-sentences-and-execut">exclude the estimated thousands of executions conducted in China</a> [press release], where the government refuses to release death penalty statistics. AI challenged China and other nations to disclose information about executions and condemned all forms of capital punishment:<br /><blockquote><br />Amnesty International believes that the death penalty legitimizes an irreversible act of violence by the state. Research demonstrates that the death penalty is often applied in a discriminatory manner, being used disproportionately against the poor, minorities and members of racial, ethnic and religious communities. The death penalty is often imposed after a grossly unfair trial. But even when trials respect international standards of fairness, the risk of executing the innocent can never be fully eliminated - the death penalty will inevitably claim innocent victims, as has been persistently demonstrated.<br /></blockquote><br />Despite the continued use of the death penalty in some countries, there is a growing movement toward international abolition. For the first time since AI started publishing its report, there were no executions in Europe for the year. Burundi and Togo also eliminated the death penalty last year, bringing the total number of abolitionist countries to 95. More than two-thirds of the world&#39;s countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Taiwanese Justice Minister <a href="http://www.moj.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=124441&CtNode=23409&mp=095">Wang Ching-feng</a> [official profile] resigned in defense of her <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/taiwan-justice-minister-resigns-over.php">position against the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. Though Taiwan has not executed a criminal since 2005, Wang said she would not sign the execution warrants of any of the 44 prisoners still on death row. Last month, a South Korean high court ruled that the death penalty does <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/south-korea-constitutional-court-rules.php">not violate the South Korean constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The court&#39;s decision could lead to a reinstatement of the death penalty in South Korea, which has held an unofficial moratorium on capital punishment since 1998. Earlier this year, Mongolian <a href="http://www.president.mn/eng/president/biography.php">President Elbegdorj Tsakhia</a> [official profile] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/mongolia-president-suspends-death.php">suspend the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] and commute the sentences of all prisoners currently on death row to 30 years in prison. UN Under-Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/ordzhonikidze_bio.asp">Sergei Ordzhonikidze</a> [official profile] has praised the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-official-applauds-states-efforts-to.php">increase in the number of countries</a> [JURIST report] that have suspended or abolished the death penalty. Speaking at the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/4th-World-Congress-Against-the-Death-Penalty">4th World Congress Against the Death Penalty</a> [FIDH backgrounder] in Geneva last month, Ordzhonikidze expressed hope that countries that have not abolished the death penalty would adopt the 2007 <a href="http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/apro/APROweb.nsf/pages/adpan_UNGA_62149">UN Resolution 62/149</a> [text], placing a moratorium on the use of capital punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-3-29-AMPvUSPTO-Opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that patents held on two genes linked to hereditary ovarian and breast cancer are invalid. The ruling was in response to a suit <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-human.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.pubpat.org/">Public Patent Foundation</a> (PUBPAT) [advocacy websites] on behalf of patients and scientists challenging patents held by <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website] on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA">BCRA genes</a> [NCI backgrounder]. Judge Robert Sweet held that, &quot;[b]ecause the claimed isolated DNA is not markedly different from native DNA as it exists in nature, it constitutes unpatentable subject matter.&quot; The complaint also alleged that the patents were unconstitutional under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a>, <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a> [text] of the Constitution, but the court did not address the constitutionality of the patents because the case could be decided under patent law. ACLU staff attorney Chris Hansen <a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech-womens-rights/patents-breast-cancer-genes-ruled-invalid-aclupubpat-case">hailed the ruling</a> [press release] as a &quot;victory for the free flow of ideas in scientific research,&quot; stating:<br /><blockquote><br />The human genome, like the structure of blood, air or water, was discovered, not created. There is an endless amount of information on genes that begs for further discovery, and gene patents put up unacceptable barriers to the free exchange of ideas.<br /></blockquote><br />Opponents of the ruling <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/business/30gene.html?src=me">contend</a> [NYT report] that restricting patents on human genes will actually decrease the amount of genetic research performed by the public sector because it will no longer be profitable for companies to study human genes. They also say the result of the ruling will be to push genetic research into primarily government-funded institutions such as universities. Monday&#39;s ruling is expected to be appealed.<br /><br />If Monday&#39;s ruling stands, it could invalidate patents covering nearly 2,000 human genes. Genetic research companies currently hold patents to approximately 20 percent of the human genetic code. Many of the patented genes are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s and cancer. The holder of a gene patent can prevent others from studying the gene and can also develop testing for specific genetic mutations, which they can then market without direct competition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/Federal-Government/Chancellor/chancellor.html">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official profile] on Monday maintained that Turkey should become a European Union (EU) &quot;preferred partner&quot; rather than continue as a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/eu_turkey_relations_en.htm">candidate</a> [EU materials] country for EU accession. Turkey has only opened 12 of the 35 chapters toward <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">accession to the EU</a> [criteria materials], and continues to face diplomatic challenges that compromise its bid towards accession. In particular, Turkey has yet to resolve its relation to Cyprus, and Merkel <a href="http://www.n-tv.de/politik/Merkel-will-Partnerschaft-erklaeren-article798603.html">urged</a> [N-TV report, in German] Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish] to open Turkey&#39;s ports to vessels from Cyprus and take steps towards a conciliatory solution to the impasse on the island. Merkel also exhorted Turkey to <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=turkey-and-germany-seeking-strategic-partnership-despite-hurdles-2010-03-29">agree</a> [Hurriyet report] to increase sanctions for Iranian nuclear development and toned down prior discussions on teaching Turkish in the German school system. On Friday, after talks with EU officials in Brussels, the Turkish chief negotiator for Turkish accession to the EU, Egemen Bagis, <a href="http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2010/03/28/nb-02">rejected</a> [SETimes report] the German proposal for a &quot;preferred partnership.&quot;<br /><br />Germany is the country with the largest community of Turkish emigres, with an estimated 2.5 million, and Turkey is one of its largest trading partners. Germany is also one of the staunchest opponents among EU members to Turkish EU membership. Turkey has faced several obstacles as it works toward accession. Turkish human rights and foreign relations are reportedly compromising  the country&#39;s efforts toward EU accession, receiving <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/1519&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">mixed reviews</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/turkish-foreign-relations-compromising.php">report</a>] in October in the European Commission&#39;s annual reports on <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2009/strategy_paper_2009_en.pdf">enlargement strategy</a> and candidate <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2009/tr_rapport_2009_en.pdf">progress</a>  [reports, PDF]. Last May, an EU advisory council said that <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">Turkey should do more</a> [JURIST report] in terms of judicial reform, protection of citizens&#39; rights, and various other efforts in order to further its request for accession.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile] signed a bill Monday re-implementing a ban on <a href="/currentawareness/cloning.php">human cloning</a> [JURIST news archive] in Russia, according to the Kremlin Press Service. The bill, which replaces a previous ban on human cloning that expired in 2007, <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100329/158353194.html">prohibits attempts to clone human beings</a> [RIA Novosti report] until the state determines how to regulate the practice. The bill does not prevent embryonic <a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/">stem cell</a> [NIH report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=stem+cell">news archive</a>] research. The <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100310/158146346.html">lower</a> [RIA Novosti report] and <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100317/158224419.html">upper houses</a> [RIA Novosti report] of Russia&#39;s parliament approved the legislation earlier this month.<br /><br />Last year, the US <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institute of Health</a> (NIH) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-announces.php">issued proposed guidelines</a> [JURIST report] for funding human embryonic research, which would allow funding only if the embryos would have otherwise been destroyed and the donor consented to their use for research. The guidelines also state that stem cells cannot be obtained from somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning, and from embryos specifically created for research. In 2007, the <a href="http://www.ias.unu.edu/">UN Institute of Advanced Studies</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-group-calls-for-human-cloning-ban.php">called for a global ban</a> [JURIST report] on cloning. In 2005, the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/un-backs-us-supported-ban-on-human.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a non-binding <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/59/280">resolution</a> [materials] calling for a total ban on human cloning, after negotiations for a binding treaty collapsed. More than 50 countries have enacted domestic bans on human cloning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-29-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-338.pdf">Renico v. Lett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-to-hear-transnational.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether double jeopardy is violated by a new trial after a state trial court declared a mistrial due to the jury&#39;s inability to reach a verdict. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0192n-06.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the decision of the district court that the second trial violated the rights of the defendant, Reginald Lett. The decision overturned a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court, which found that the second trial did not violate the double jeopardy bar. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the Sixth Circuit failed to properly defer to the Michigan court under the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [text, PDF]. Counsel for the respondent, Lett, argued that, &quot;<em>habeas</em> relief was properly granted.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1191.pdf">Morrison v. National Australia Bank</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether foreign investors are entitled to bring fraud-on-the-market claims under Section 10(b) of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities and Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF] when the stock purchased was that of a foreign company on a foreign securities exchange. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82f55fd5-aec6-4bc5-a292-bc7443060f4c/1/doc/07-0583-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/82f55fd5-aec6-4bc5-a292-bc7443060f4c/1/hilite/">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the decision of the district court to dismiss the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. It found that actions outside of the US were more responsible for the fraud than anything that occurred within the US. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the federal court had jurisdiction over the claim. Counsel for the respondents argued, &quot;unlike the rights of action that this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied. Congress didn&#39;t intend for this right of action to exist even domestically, let alone extraterritorially.&quot; Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of respondents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] on Tuesday ordered that alleged Serbian war criminal <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/dragan_vasiljkovic_478.html">Dragan Vasiljkovic</a> [Trial Watch backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Dragan+Vasiljkovic">news archive</a>] be extradited to Croatia to face prosecution. Vasiljkovic, an Australian citizen also known as Daniel Snedden, is accused of war crimes occurring during the 1991-1995 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croatian war of independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The high court&#39;s decision overturns a September ruling by the <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/index.html">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2009/111.html">held</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/australia-court-allows-accused-serb-war.php">report</a>] that Vasiljkovic should not be extradited due to the risk that his political beliefs would subject him to prejudice if he were returned to Croatia.<br /><br />The High Court&#39;s decision comes after a prolonged judicial debate over whether Vasiljkovic should be returned to Croatia to stand trial.  In 2007, an Australian court <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/australia-court-orders-accused-serb-war.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] that Vasiljkovic be handed over to Croatian authorities. Subsequent appeals resulted in conflicting federal court judgments and ultimately led to Tuesday&#39;s high court decision. Vasiljkovic was <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/accused-serb-war-criminal-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> in Australia in 2006 pursuant to an <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/croatia-to-ask-australia-to-extradite.php">extradition request</a> [JURIST reports] from the Croatian government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigerien police arrested a dozen former ministers and officials loyal to ousted president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8181537.stm">Mamadou Tandja</a> [BBC profile] late Sunday. The close aides to Tandja, including former finance minister Lamine Zeine, former justice minister Garba Lompo, and former minister of public works Lamido Oumarou, were detained and questioned on charges of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8592787.stm">plotting and carrying out subversive activities</a> [BBC report] against the military junta. Interior Minister Cisse Ousmane asserted over state television that there would be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62S2K720100329">strict enforcement</a> [Reuters report] against activities that disturb the peace and public order. After last month&#8217;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-military-leaders-suspend.php">coup</a> [JURIST report], acting head of state <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-02/22/c_13183350.htm">Major Salou Djibo</a> [Xinhua profile] pledged to clean up the corruption, and the military junta, which is calling itself the Supreme Council for Restoration of Democracy (CSRD), has promised to turn Niger into a democracy. While the CSRD announced the creation of a task force to draft a new constitution and electoral laws, a constitutional committee, and a court to replace those that were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-military-leaders-suspend.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] following the coup, it has given no time frame for the transition to civilian rule. International observers have urged the junta to hold elections and Niger has since been <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/2010/feb/216psc/Communique%20Niger%20_eng_%20Final%20_2_.pdf">expelled</a> [press release, PDF] from the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a> [official website]. <br /><br />The February coup, which left at least three Nigerien soldiers dead, was in response to a referendum <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">abolishing presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report], allowing Tandja to remain in office for three more years and to run in any subsequent elections. Niger&#39;s opposition parties denounced the referendum, claiming that Tandja inflated poll numbers to support the new constitution&#39;s adoption. After the coup, Nigerien rights group United Front for the Safeguard of Democratic Assets (Fusad), called for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-rights-group-urges-prosecution-of.php">prosecution of Tandja</a> [JURIST report] on treason charges. Allied with the opposition party, Fusad claims that Tandja is guilty of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1T7d7-cyXuGezbtZ7VplwCV2ZiA">corruption violating the constitution</a> [AFP report], and alleges that he gave out contracts to foreign oil and uranium firms. <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ng.html">Niger</a> [CIA World Factbook profile], which is known for its exportation of uranium, has gone through five constitutions and military regimes since it&#39;s founding in 1960.

The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit applied the comparative-disparity test, which calculates the percentage of otherwise eligible jurors from a given group who are excluded from jury service, and <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0352p-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendant&#39;s right was violated. In reversing the decision below, the court declined to adopt an explicit standard. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote:<blockquote>Each test is imperfect. Absolute disparity and comparative disparity measurements, courts have recognized, can be misleading when, as here, &quot;members of the distinctive group comp[ose] [only] a small percentage of those eligible for jury service.&quot; And to our knowledge, &quot;[n]o court ... has accepted [a standard deviation analysis] alone as determinative in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection systems.&quot;</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion.<br /><br />The defendant, Diapolis Smith, is an African-American convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in Kent County, Michigan in 1993. At the time of Smith&#39;s trial, African-Americans constituted 7.28 percent of Kent County&#39;s jury-eligible population, and 6 percent of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal grand jury in the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Monday returned a <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/03/29/stone.pdf">five-count indictment</a> [text, PDF] against nine suspected members of the Hutaree &quot;militia&quot; group accused of plotting to kill police officers. The group members allegedly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hGc00FR9o4OUr36gm80mOpG00ccwD9EOD0600">planned to kill</a> [AP report] Michigan law enforcement officers by, among other methods, making phony 911 calls and ambushing those who responded. The members then planned to attack the funeral processions of the fallen officers. The charges against the nine individuals include seditious conspiracy, attempted use of weapons of mass destruction, teaching the use of explosive materials and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence. The FBI announced that eight of the nine members of the group are <a href="http://detroit.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/de032910.htm">in custody</a> [press release] and had been indicted, and the ninth member is a currently at-large. Andrew Arena, the Special Agent in Charge, commented on the national interest in these arrests, saying, &quot;[t]he FBI takes such extremist groups seriously, especially those who would target innocent citizens and the law enforcement officers who protect the citizens of the United States.&quot; One of the counts of the indictment, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, carries a possible sentence of life in prison. <br /><br />Right-wing nativist and so-called &quot;patriot&quot; anti-government militias such as the Hutaree are on the rise in the US, and a recent report by the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441251">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> [advocacy website] suggests that a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/lack-of-internet-regulations-enables.php">lack of regulation on the Internet</a> [JURIST report] is fueling this increased prevalence. A report by the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website], released last year, noted that these groups are <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/anti-government-militias-growing-in-us.php">making a comeback</a> [JURIST report] after declining in number for a number of years. The SPLC said that such groups are generally anti-tax, anti-immigration, and increasingly racially motivated since the election of the country&#39;s first African-American president, Barack Obama. The SPLC also warned that these groups could soon pose a security risk to the country, quoting one official as saying &#8220;[a]ll it&#39;s lacking is a spark. I think it&#39;s only a matter of time before you see threats and violence.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Turkish ruling party on Tuesday submitted its controversial reform package to parliament, despite warnings from Turkish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6595511.stm">President Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC profile] that the party should take more precautions before amending the constitution. The reform package contains <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=box-box-box---for-revised-reform-package-story-2010-03-30">seven revisions</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report] from the original amendments <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-unveils-proposed.php">unveiled last week</a> [JURIST report], including a highly-disputed reform to the judiciary system that would allow military and government officials to be tried in civilian court. The reform would also make it harder for the government to disband political parties that challenge the country&#39;s nationalist establishment and would ban the prosecution of the 1980 coup leaders. The ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] created the amendments to promote democracy in Turkey and support its bid into the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. The parliamentary vote will take place next week, but will most likely be put to a public referendum as there may not be adequate support between the parties. Opposition parties have spoken out against the reforms, holding that the amendments are not aimed at enhancing democratic principles, but instead to cement AKP&#39;s standing as the ruling party.<br /><br />The proposed amendments have been met with opposition by Turkey&#39;s <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Turkish]. In an interview last week, the president of the court <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/content/view/44/36/">Hasan Gerceker</a> [official profile, in Turkish] declared that the proposed <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/top-turkish-judge-proposed.php">amendments threaten separation of power and judicial independence</a> [JURIST report]. Turkey has faced several obstacles as it works toward membership in the EU, including its human rights record, its stance towards political parties, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=turkish+coup">tension</a>  [JURIST news archive] between the AKP and the military.

Kentucky</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentvi">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] guarantee of effective assistance of counsel requires a criminal defense lawyer to advise a non-citizen client that pleading guilty to an aggravated felony will trigger mandatory, automatic deportation. The Supreme Court of Kentucky <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/padilla-lower-opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a guilty plea induced by bad advice does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel and does not warrant setting aside the guilty plea. In reversing the decision below, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />We granted <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> to decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla&#39;s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that we do not address.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined.<br /><br />Honduras native Jose Padilla has been a lawful permanent resident of the US for more than 40 years. He pleaded guilty to transporting a large amount of marijuana, making him subject to deportation proceedings. Padilla claims that he would not have pleaded guilty had his lawyer informed him that he would risk deportation. Padilla shares the same name as convicted terrorist Jose Padilla, currently serving a 17-year sentence, but is of no relation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Executive secretary of the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) [official website] Yvo de Boer said Wednesday that it is unlikely a new climate change treaty will be concluded until 2011. After the Copenhagen summit (COP15) in December <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/no-legally-binding-agreement-on-climate.php">failed to produce</a> [JURIST report] a binding agreement, de Boer expressed hope that the next annual meeting in November in Cancun, Mexico will get <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304252704575155401087430006.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines">negotiations back on track</a> [AP report]. The UNFCCC <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20100331_pr_cop_report_v2.pdf">announced</a> [press release] that 111 countries and the European Union (EU) have expressed support for the non-binding <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF], which calls for self-imposed limits on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greenhouse+gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Additionally, the UNFCCC received 75 national pledges, from nations that account for more than 80 percent of global emissions from energy use, to cut or limit emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020. De Boer noted these pledges will not suffice to meet the Copenhagen Accord&#39;s goal of <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34255&Cr=climate+change&Cr1=">limiting global temperatures</a> [UN News Centre report] to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. <br /><br />Earlier this month, China and India, among the world&#39;s largest and most quickly growing producers of greenhouse gas emissions, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-india-agree-to-non-binding.php">agreed to endorse</a> [JURIST report] the Copenhagen Accord. The UNFCCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-climate-change-talks-to-resume-in.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in February that another round of formal climate talks will be held April 9-11 in Bonn, Germany, to follow up on the recent Copenhagen conference. While no legally-binding agreement was reached at the conclusion of the COP15 in December, 192 UN member countries agreed to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33305&Cr=Copenhagen&Cr1=">take note</a> [UN News Centre report] of the non-binding accord developed by leaders from the US, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa. In January, more than 50 countries, including the US, China, and EU member states, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/more-than-50-countries-submit-climate.php">submitted plans</a> [JURIST report] to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the UNFCCC. Relative to 2005 levels, the US has pledged to reduce emissions to 17 percent, while China has targeted a 40 to 45 percent reduction per GDP unit. EU members pledged a 20 percent reduction below 1990 levels.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] criticized the government Tuesday for a lack of accountability, despite <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?1994cv1756-522">granting approval</a> [order, PDF; <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?1994cv1756-521">opinion</a>, PDF] to a $3 million settlement agreement in a civil suit brought by former <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/index.htm">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website] agent Richard Horn. The government evoked the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive] to prevent documents from being made public in the case in which Horn accused the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] of spying on him. Despite granting the approval, Chief Judge Royce Lamberth expressed his displeasure with the government for what he believed was a lack of accountability to the taxpayers. He wrote:<blockquote>However, it is not without some misgiving that the Court reaches this decision. Another member of this Court last year approved the settlement of another case (involving the FBI&#39;s investigation of the anthrax mailings in late 2001) which involved payment to an individual plaintiff of almost $6,000,000 by the United States. It does not appear that any government official was ever held accountable this huge loss to the taxpayer.<br /><br />Now this Court is called upon to approve a $3,000,000 payment to an individual plaintiff by the United States, and again it does not appear that any government officials have held accountable for this loss to the taxpayer. This is troubling to the the Court.</blockquote>Lamberth asked <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] if there was an internal investigation regarding who committed the wrong-doing.<br /><br />Horn, a former agent in Myanmar, is <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17530645/Horn-v-Huddle-et-al-Summons-and-Complaint-Document-233">suing</a> [summons and complaint] Franklin Huddle, the Chief of the Mission of the American Embassy in Myanmar, and Arthur Brown, a CIA agent stationed there, for violating his civil rights and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2520.html">anti-wiretapping laws</a> [text] during 1992 and 1993. Huddle and Brown are alleged to have intercepted communications intended for Horn and to have conspired to have him removed from his position. In August, Lamberth ordered the government to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-grants-lawyers-security.php">grant security clearance</a> [JURIST report] to lawyers on both sides of the civil suit. In late July, Lamberth ordered that documents relating to the case be <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-judge-finds-cia-committed-fraud.php">unsealed</a> [JURIST report], and charged that the CIA committed fraud in keeping the documents secret.

		<title>Afghanistan rights abuses leading to poverty: UN report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Corruption, abuse of power, and a focus on short-term security goals in Afghanistan have intensified the issue of poverty, affecting more than two-thirds of the population, according to a Tuesday <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/SPdocs/Countries/AF/PovertyReport_30032010.doc">report</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">press release</a>] from the UN&#39;s <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website]. According to the report 36 percent, or nine million people, live in absolute poverty and cannot meet basic needs. Additionally, 36 percent were found to live just above the poverty line. While the report said that many Afghan leaders shape public policy for their own personal or vested interests, it said that the lack of security, the disparate allocation of resources, and discrimination were also reasons for the extreme poverty. The report focused on the need to address human rights issues in order find a solution to hardships facing the Afghan people:<blockquote>Poverty is neither accidental, nor inevitable in Afghanistan: it is both a cause and consequence of a massive human rights deficit including widespread impunity and inadequate investment in, and attention to, human rights.<br /><br />Understanding the human rights dimension of poverty is critical to the identification of underlying structural problems and processes that, left unaddressed, run the risk of undermining poverty reduction initiatives. A human rights perspective and analysis helps ensure that causes, and not just consequences, inform the design and implementation of programmes geared to the alleviation or elimination of chronic poverty.</blockquote>The information for the report was provided by a survey given to some of the poorest communities in the Afghan provinces, along with interviews of local and national experts.<br /><br />Afghanistan has received much criticism for its human rights record. Earlier this month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] delivered a <a href="http://www.unama-afg.org/docs/_UN-Docs1/UN-HCHR/09march05-Annual-Report-HCHR-%20ENG%205%20MARCH%202009.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-afghanistan.php">report</a>] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] that said Afghanistan&#39;s human rights progress has been thwarted by armed conflict, censorship, abuse of power, and violence against women. In February, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] released its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials], <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">criticizing Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] for its continued use of child labor. In November, Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/10F9676D151A22DCC12574FE0050D0B3?opendocument">urged</a> [press release] Afghan President Hamad Karzai to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-chief-urges-end-to.php">put a stop to executions</a> [JURIST report] and join nations calling for a death penalty moratorium after five prisoners were executed over the course of four days.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> (NAB) [official website] on Wednesday asked Swiss officials to reopen a corruption investigation against Pakistani <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-zardari-swiss-cases-nab-sc-qs-07">request</a> [DAWN report] was made in a letter from the NAB, the country&#39;s chief anti-corruption body, to Swiss officials, but the Swiss <a href="http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home.html">Federal Department of Justice</a> [official website] has not confirmed receipt of the request. Zardari was previously convicted of money laundering in Switzerland in 2003, but that <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2003/11/200849153450576294.html">conviction was later overturned</a> [Al Jazeera report], and subsequent attempts by the Swiss to convict him were <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/swiss-drop-money-laundering-charges.php">unsuccessful</a> [JURIST report]. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by former president Pervez Musharaff. However, Zardari may face attacks on his eligibility to have been elected president in 2008, since prior allegations of corruption may have rendered him ineligible for office. <br /><br />The request by the NAB comes one day after the Supreme Court ordered the bureau to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">reopen all corruption investigations</a> [JURIST report] within 24 hours. That order was accompanied by a contempt of court notice for the bureau&#39;s chairman, Naveed Ahsan. The Supreme Court&#39;s order is likely to increase tensions between the president and the judiciary, which have recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-supreme-court-challenges.php">clashed over court appointments</a> [JURIST report]. The same day as the Supreme Court&#39;s order to the NAB, Pakistani police detained Ahmed Riaz Sheikh, Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency, in the first arrest of a government official since amnesty was rescinded. In December, a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who is accused of corruption.<br /><br />11:00 AM ET - Swiss authorities have <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/swiss-say-legal-immunity-421224.html">refused to reopen the corruption investigation</a> [AP report], claiming Zardari still has legal immunity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Tuesday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-and-dr-jill-biden-signing-health-care-and-education-reconciliatio">signed into law</a> [transcript of remarks] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04872:">Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act</a> [HR 4872 materials], which represents a group of amendments to the recently approved <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">health care legislation</a> [JURIST news archive] and also provides changes to the administration of the federal student loan program. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.03221:">Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act</a> [HR 3221 materials], a rider attached to the main bill, will remove banks and private lenders as providers for federal student loans and place that responsibility with the government. The health care amendments addressed concerns in the original bill raised by Republicans, including provisions to help uninsured Americans pay for coverage, concerns over the effects to Medicare, and lowering the penalty for not buying insurance. In his remarks, Obama lauded the changes made to the student loan program and the final passage of health care reform:<blockquote>[T]he health insurance reform bill I signed won&#39;t fix every problem in our health care system in one fell swoop. But it does represent some of the toughest insurance reforms in history. It represents a major step forward towards giving Americans with insurance - and those without - a sense of security when it comes to their health care. It enshrines the principle that when you get sick, you&#39;ve got a society there, a community, that is going to help you get back on your feet.<br /><br />For a long time, our student loan system has worked for banks and financial institutions. Today, we&#39;re finally making our student loan system work for students and our families. But we&#39;re also doing something more. From the moment I was sworn into office, I&#39;ve spoken about the urgent need for us to lay a new foundation for our economy and for our future. And two pillars of that foundation are health care and education, and each has long suffered from problems that we chose to kick down the road.</blockquote>Republicans have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/us/politics/31obama.html">criticized both bills</a> [NYT report] as harmful to the economy.<br /><br />Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> the original health care bill into law last week after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-passes-health-care-reform.php">passed by the House</a> [JURIST reports] by a vote of 219 - 212. Following that, he signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-acts-consistency-with-longst">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-executive-order-limiting.php">report</a>] continuing a prohibition on the use of federal funds for <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] except in cases of rape or incest or where a woman&#39;s life would be endangered, as part of a compromise with conservative Democrats. The same day that the original bill was signed into law, the attorneys general for 13 states filed suit in federal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">challenging the constitutionality of the new law</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] filed <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Complaint%20-%20with%20electronic%20signature.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-challenges-experimental-prison-units-restrict-communication-and-forbid-p">press release</a>] on Tuesday challenging the strict <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/thp/THX_visit_hours.pdf">visitation and communication restrictions</a> [visiting regulations, PDF] at two experimental federal prison units called &quot;Communications Management Units&quot; (CMUs). The complaint alleges that the prisoners have suffered &quot;severe and unjustifiable emotional distress&quot; as a result of being deprived of fundamental constitutional rights. Prisoners at the CMUs are forbidden from hugging, touching, or embracing their children or spouses during visits. Transfers to the CMUs are not explained and cannot be appealed to a review board. CCR attorneys also claim that the CMUs have perpetuated a &quot;pattern of religious and political discrimination and retaliation&quot; because the vast majority of CMU prisoners are Muslim. CCR Attorney Alexis Agathocleous claims that the CMUs are an &quot;experiment in social isolation&quot; that has dispensed with due process and created a situation &quot;ripe for abuse.&quot; On behalf of the prisoners, CCR is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. If granted, the injunction would place the prisoners in the general population of a less restrictive facility.<br /><br />The CMUs, located in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Marion, Illinois, were secretly opened during the George W. Bush administration. The facilities were created in response to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/24/AR2007022401231_pf.html">criticism</a> [WP report] that the prison bureau had failed to adequately monitor terrorist inmates&#39; communications. The CMUs allow prison officials to closely monitor and control the communications of certain prisoners and to isolate them from other prisoners and the outside world. Concerns about the restraints placed on inmate communication and the racial composition of the inmate population were voiced when the facilities were opened.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc854287.pdf">granted the request</a> [decision, PDF] of chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] to investigate the deadly violence perpetrated after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election">2007 Kenyan presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month, Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-prosecutor-accuses-officials-in.php">submitted the names</a> [JURIST report] of 20 senior political and business leaders who allegedly &quot;bear the gravest responsibility&quot; for the post-election violence. The ICC&#39;s decision to authorize the prosecutor&#39;s investigation means that Kenyan leaders may be called before the court. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/D81AA5AF-CD76-4B3C-A4FC-AA7819569B44.htm">Summarizing the decision</a> [press release], the court explained:<br /><blockquote><br />upon examination of the available information, bearing in mind the nature of the proceedings under article 15 of the Statute, the low threshold applicable at this stage, as well as the object and purpose of this decision, the information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed on Kenyan territory. The majority moreover found that all criteria for the exercise of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction were satisfied, to the standard of proof applicable at this stage. <br /></blockquote><br />The prosecutor will outline the next steps for the investigation in a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6ACA1217-37C5-4F7D-AC5A-F7BA431DE8EE.htm">press conference</a> [press release] on Thursday.  <br /><br />Ocampo provided the list of 20 names after ICC judges requested last month that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-judges-seek-additional-information.php">provide additional information</a> regarding his <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-prosecutor-seeking-formal.php">request to open a formal investigation</a> [JURIST reports] into allegations of crimes against humanity. Ocampo&#39;s submission to investigate the Kenyan situation is historic, in that it is the first time he has used his <span style="font-style: italic;">proprio motu</span> power, which allows him to initiate formal investigations upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] following the 2007 elections led to violence that caused the deaths of more than 1,000 people and displacement of 500,000 others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Indian court on Wednesday heard final arguments in the trial of <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammed Ajmal Kasab</a> [NDTV backgrounder], accused of participating in the November 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terrorist attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+terror+attack">news archive</a>], bringing the yearlong proceedings to a close. The court heard from more than <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/31/AR2010033100762.html">600 prosecution witnesses</a> [WP report] and two members of the <a href="http://india.gov.in/outerwin.php?id=http://nsg.gov.in/">National Security Guard</a> [official website] who responded to the attack. Prosecutors accuse Kasab of being one of the gunmen photographed during the attacks, which were allegedly coordinated by Pakistani militant group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder]. Kasab claims that he confessed to the crimes in February 2009 after being <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/news/national/article253771.ece?homepage=true">tortured</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Hindu</span> report] by police. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304252704575155720699056954.html?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines">praised</a> [WSJ report] the speed with which the trial was conducted. Judge ML Tahiliyani, specially <a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200901131015.htm">appointed</a> [PTI report] in January 2009 to preside over the trial of three suspects detained after the attacks, <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-Kasabs-trial-concludes-verdict-on-May-3/articleshow/5746965.cms">reserved judgment</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times of India</span> report] until May 3.<br /><br />The lawyer for the accused gunman faced several setbacks during the trial, including a failed <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/kasabs-juvenile-plea-falls-flat-in-court/448437/">change of venue to a juvenile court</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Indian Express</span> report] and the introduction of the disputed confession. Kasab&#39;s first defense lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/india-judge-removes-mumbai-terror.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] last year because she had agreed to represent a victim of the attacks in a civil suit. Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/india-court-begins-trial-of-mumbai.php">first appeared </a>[JURIST report] before Tahiliyani in March 2009 via video. In February 2009, Pakistan officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-official-concedes-mumbai.php">conceded</a> [JURIST report] that the attacks were partially planned in their country and that the perpetrators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/world/asia/13pstan.html?_r=1&hp">traveled by ship</a> [NYT report] from southern Pakistan to Mumbai. One scholar had suggested that an <a href="/forumy/2008/12/establishing-international-tribunal-for.php">international tribunal be formed</a> [JURIST op-ed] in order to avoid further complications between Pakistan and India. The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at 10 locations across the city including the landmark Taj Mahal Palace hotel where nine of the 10 gunmen were killed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-31-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Wednesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-60.pdf">Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-to-hear-fourth-amendment.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a person convicted under state law for simple drug possession (a federal law misdemeanor) has been &quot;convicted&quot; of an &quot;aggravated felony&quot; on the theory that he could have been prosecuted for recidivist simple possession (a federal law felony), even though there was no charge or finding of a prior conviction in his prosecution for possession. Under the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [text], a lawful permanent resident who has been &quot;convicted&quot; of an &quot;aggravated felony&quot; is ineligible to seek cancellation of removal. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-61006-CV0.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a state law conviction for simple drug possession could be an &quot;aggravated felony&quot; if the defendant could have been charged with a felony, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals holding that Jose Angel Carachuri-Rosendo is ineligible for cancellation of removal. Counsel for the petitioner, Carachuri-Rosendo argued that, &quot;[i]ndividuals, such as Petitioner, who have been convicted of drug possession but as to whom there has been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled Substances Act rather than a felony.&quot; Counsel for the US government argued that, &quot;Congress&#39;s judgment here was that all aliens who engage in the same serious conduct would be treated the same for immigration purposes.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-6261.pdf">Robertson v. United States ex rel. Watson</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether an action for criminal contempt in a congressionally created court may constitutionally be brought in the name and pursuant to the power of a private person, rather than in the name and pursuant to the power of the US. Counsel for the petitioner, John Robertson, argued:<blockquote>The United States now agrees that the fact that a criminal offense may only be prosecuted by the sovereign is a foundational premise of our Constitution. Because Mr. Robertson was prosecuted for criminal contempt in a private right of action, his prosecution was unconstitutional, a nullity in our view, and his convictions must be vacated.</blockquote>Counsel for US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of respondent that:<blockquote>when a single US Attorney&#39;s Office says that the government will decide to drop a certain set of charges, that US Attorney&#39;s Office we believe is - is speaking for itself, unless there is some indication that it is speaking more widely in such a way that will bind other parts of the government.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/index.asp">Serbian Parliament</a> [official website] adopted a declaration early Wednesday morning condemning the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC timeline; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>], in which 8,000 Muslims were killed. After a day-long debate, <a href="http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/aktivnosti/skupstinske_detalji.asp?Id=1999&t=A">&quot;The Declaration of the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia Condemning the Crime in  Srebrenica&quot;</a> [official summary] was passed by a narrow margin, with <a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_8591/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=qRja0Eda">127 out 250 members</a> [AP report] voting in its favor. The parliament also called upon other former Yugoslavian countries to <a href="http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/vest.php?id=64545">issue similar declarations</a> [press release]. Head of the Deputy Group for European Serbia Nada Kolundzija stated that &quot;passing the declaration is in the Serbian people&#39;s best interest and it is its moral duty to distance itself from the crime.&quot; The declaration was also met with criticism from some members of parliament. MP Dragan Todorovic told Serbia&#39;s Radio Srbija that the <a href="http://glassrbije.org/E/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10430&Itemid=27">declaration should be withdrawn</a> [Radio Srbija report] because of the negative light it will cast on the nation. Other criticisms are that the declaration did not call the massacre a genocide and that the declaration did not condemn all of the crimes that occurred in Yugoslavia from 1991-1995.<br /><br />On Tuesday, The Hague Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">upheld UN immunity</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution in claims brought by relatives of victims of the Srebrenica massacre. The group, known as the Mothers of Srebrenica, alleged that the Netherlands should be held liable for Dutch soldiers negligently failing to protect  civilians during the Bosnian conflict by forcing them out of a UN-designated &quot;safe area.&quot; The court found that immunity is essential to the UN being able to carry out its duties and that the Dutch soldiers could not be held responsible in their capacity as UN peacekeepers. Earlier this month, former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Radovan+Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive] made his <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">opening statement</a> [JURIST report] before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, where he is being tried for war crimes. He is defending himself against 11 counts, including genocide and murder. Karadzic has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/karadzic-claims-attacks-on-bosnian.php">called the massacre a farce</a> [JURIST report] promulgated by Bosnian Muslims to incite hatred against Serbian forces. He could face life in prison if convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-30-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Tuesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-6338.pdf">Dillon v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-takes-student-religious.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">federal sentencing guidelines</a> [materials] are binding when a federal judge imposes a new sentence. Under the Supreme Court&#39;s 2005 ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-104.ZS.html">United States v. Booker</a> [opinion text], the guidelines are advisory only, but the court has never ruled on <u>Booker</u>&#39;s application to a sentence modification proceeding. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/083397np.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <u>Booker</u> should not apply in sentence modification proceedings, upholding Percy Dillon&#39;s modified sentence. Counsel for the petitioner, Dillon, argued:<blockquote>Sentencing commission policy cannot override this Court&#39;s clear and unambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines as advisory in all cases moving forward, and any interpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the commission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not only as matter of statutory <span style="font-style:italic;">stare decisis</span>, but because it would violate the Sixth Amendment.</blockquote>Counsel for the United States argued:<blockquote>The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of sentence. They instead provide a discretionary mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants who have already been sentenced.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-5201.pdf">Barber v. Thomas</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-to-hear-transnational.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3624.html">Sentencing Reform Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 3624(b), text] requires the federal prison system to calculate good time served credits based on the sentence imposed. The federal <a href="http://www.bop.gov/">Bureau of Prisons</a> (BOP) [official website] has been interpreting &quot;term of imprisonment&quot; to mean time served, rather than sentence imposed, as it is interpreted throughout federal sentencing statutes. The BOP&#39;s interpretation has resulted in fewer days of available credit each year of the sentence. Lower courts remain split on the question. Counsel for the petitioners argued that, &quot;[t]he flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is that they do not give credit towards the term of imprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates.&quot; Counsel for the respondent argued in favor of the BOP&#39;s system.

The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/dc149802-ded0-423f-b584-a287fdb0b068/2/doc/07-0141-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/dc149802-ded0-423f-b584-a287fdb0b068/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the state law was substantive and could be applied in federal court, upholding a lower court&#39;s dismissal of the suit. In reversing the decision below, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a divided court:<blockquote>The short of the matter is that a Federal Rule governing procedure is valid whether or not it alters the outcome of the case in a way that induces forum shopping. To hold otherwise would be to &quot;disembowel either the Constitution&#39;s grant of power over federal procedure&quot; or Congress&#39;s exercise of it.</blockquote>Justice John Paul Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito joined.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.shadygroveortho.com/">Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates</a> filed a class action lawsuit against <a href="http://www.allstate.com/">Allstate Insurance Co.</a> [corporate websites] in federal court. The issue was whether a New York state law, which prohibits a lawsuit seeking a statutory penalty from being brought as a class action, is substantive or procedural under the <a href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/e/erie-doctrine/">Erie doctrine</a> [backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] on Tuesday threatened to imprison the head of the country&#39;s corruption agency for failing to meet a 24-hour deadline to reopen several corruption cases. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=204">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Iftikhar+Muhammad+Chaudhry">news archive</a>] gave <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> (NAB) [official website] Chairman  Naveed Ahsan and acting Chairman Irfan Nadeem another day to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD9EOVNDG0">reopen the cases</a> [AP report], including several against <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. Ahsan pledged in writing that the cases would be reopened. The court&#39;s order displays the continuing tension between Pakistan&#39;s government and judiciary. In response to the court&#39;s orders, police <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-47325020100330">detained</a> [Reuters report] Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/msg_dg.htm">Ahmed Riaz Sheikh</a> [official website], who was convicted of corruption eight years ago. Sheikh&#39;s prison sentence was waived in 2002, and he was subsequently promoted within the agency, after former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>] issued amnesty in 2007. <br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s arrest is the first since the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pakistan-high-court-releases-detailed.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text], which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/fr">Council of State</a> [official website, in French] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/media/document/avis/etude_vi_30032010.pdf">advised the French government</a> [report, PDF; in French] that a complete ban on full Islamic veils risks violating the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp">Constitution</a> [text] and the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The government requested that the council, the country&#39;s highest administrative court, review the proposed ban before drawing up legislation. The government has already banned public officials from wearing veils while operating in their official capacity, and also prohibits veils in public schools. The council held that even with the existence of these partial bans, which are based on France&#39;s secular principles, it could find no legal basis for a complete ban on veils in public places. The council held that there could be a legal foundation for the ban in situations that require public security and protections against fraud.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Belgian parliamentary committee voted unanimously Wednesday to ban the Islamic <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and other &quot;full veils&quot; from being worn in public. The <a href="http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=/flwb&language=fr&rightmenu=right&cfm=flwbn.cfm?lang=F&legislat=52&dossierID=2289">proposed legislation</a> [materials, in French] applies to areas &quot;accessible to the public&quot; or areas meant for &quot;public use or to provide public services.&quot; Violators could face a penalty of up to seven days in jail or a fine of 15 to 25 euros. The proposed law does not impose restrictions on traditional Muslim headscarves, and it provides for groups to apply for a <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7083103.ece">temporary exemption</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times Online</span> report] for festivals or other events. The proposed ban has ignited concern among some who view it as an &quot;attack on civil liberties.&quot; If approved by <a href="http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/choose_language.cfm">Parliament</a> [official website, in Dutch], Belgium will be the first European nation to impose a nationwide restriction on traditional face-covering veils. The lower house of parliament is scheduled to vote on the bill on April 22.<br /><br />France has also been pressing for a ban on the burqa. Earlier this week, the French <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/fr">Council of State</a> [official website, in French] <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/cde/media/document/avis/etude_vi_30032010.pdf">advised the French government</a> [report, PDF; in French] that a complete ban on full Islamic veils <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-council-advises-against-full.php">risks violating</a> [JURIST report] the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp">Constitution</a> [text] and the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. Last week, French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicholas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French] announced that the government will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-to-propose-law-banning-full-face.php">introduce legislation</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/les-actualites/conseil-des-ministres/conseil-des-ministres.449.html?lang=fr&mode=view&cat_id=1&press_id=3476">ban traditional Muslim face veils</a> [transcript, in French] in public places. Sarkozy&#39;s announcement came just weeks after a French parliamentary commission charged with investigating whether to enact laws banning the wearing of burqas released its <a href="/pdf/rapportviole.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; in French] calling for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-parliamentary-commission.php">partial ban</a> [JURIST report] that would apply in public facilities, including hospitals, schools, and public transportation, and to any individual attempting to receive public services. Also last week, lawmakers in Quebec introduced a bill that would <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/785036--quebec-niqab-bill-makes-women-unveil-to-get-public-services">ban women wearing full face veils from public services</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Star</span> report], such as receiving care at a hospital or going to a public university.
