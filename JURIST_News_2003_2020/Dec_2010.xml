		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdod.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] on Tuesday released an extensive <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130(secure-hires).pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] concluding that the repeal of the military's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>] policy would only minimally effect military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. The Pentagon found that the repeal of DADT would likely bring about some limited and isolated disruption, but, with proper implementation, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=61899&261899=20101130">risk to overall military readiness is extremely low</a> [press release]. The DOD also released a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport-SPI_FINAL_20101130(secure-hires).pdf">Support Plan for Implementation</a> [text, PDF], laying out the Comprehensive Review Working Group's recommendations to proceed with the repeal in a form similar to a military operations order. If Congress repeals DADT, the plan suggests a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=61896">phase-out of DADT</a> [press release] for the military to follow. Defense Secretary Robert Gates <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=61895">stated</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.pentagonchannel.mil/?pid=E3MQ43400pGCv_357aGsC4qeNYG4q1_d">press briefing video</a>] that he was "determined to see that if the law is repealed," the changes would be implemented in a way to "minimize any negative impact on the morale, cohesion and effectiveness of combat units that are deployed, or about to deploy to the front lines." President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/11/30/president-obama-dod-report-don-t-ask-don-t-tell">endorsed the report</a> [press release] and called on the Senate to repeal the law by the end of this year:<blockquote>Today's report confirms that a strong majority of our military men and women and their families-more than two thirds-are prepared to serve alongside Americans who are openly gay and lesbian. This report also confirms that, by every measure-from unit cohesion to recruitment and retention to family readiness-we can transition to a new policy in a responsible manner that ensures our military strength and national security. And for the first time since this law was enacted 17 years ago today, both the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have publicly endorsed ending this policy.</blockquote>In May, the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official websites] voted to repeal the policy after Obama and Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">agreed to a compromise</a> [JURIST reports] that would prevent the repeal from taking effect until the completion of the review.

<p>Last week, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision ordering her reinstatement. In November, Gates called on the <a href="paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Gates issued a memorandum <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior Department of Defense officials. In September, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a US Air Force officer to be reinstated after being previously discharged under DADT. Also in September, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">rejected a cloture motion</a> [JURIST report] on a defense appropriations bill that would have repealed the policy. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontindonesiaarms.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday urged the Indonesian government to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/94454/section/11">repeal two Sharia laws</a> [report materials; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/29/indonesia-local-sharia-laws-violate-rights-aceh">press release</a>] that the group says violate human rights and international treaties. The laws, local to the Aceh province, require strict Islamic dress in public and prohibit unmarried men and women from being alone together. The report does not criticize all Islamic law: <blockquote>Human Rights Watch takes no position on Sharia law or on provisions that regulate the internal workings of Islam. We are concerned, however, that two of the laws&#8212;one prohibiting unmarried individuals of different sexes from being together in certain circumstances, the other imposing public dress requirements on Muslims&#8212;violate Indonesia's constitutional protections for basic rights as well as international human rights law which Indonesia has accepted as legally binding.</blockquote>HRW claims that the laws are applied unfairly, targeting mainly women and the poor, and impose punishments that are too severe. The group also argues that the laws violate international treaties, such as the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a>, the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a> (CEDAW) [texts] and the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> (CRC) [official website]. 

<p>Human rights groups that have been pushing for reform in Indonesia. In October, the <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/">Indonesian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Bahasa] <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/index.php?page=website.BeritaInternalLengkap&id=4644">overturned</a> [press release, in Bahasa; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/indonesia-court-strikes-down-law-allowing-government-to-ban-books.php">report</a>] a law that has allowed the Indonesian government to ban books it deemed controversial for nearly 50 years. The court <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/14/court-ruling-ends-govt%E2%80%99s-authority-ban-books.html">found</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report] that giving the <a href="http://www.kejaksaan.go.id/">Attorney General</a> [official website, in Bahasa] the authority to ban books violated the Indonesian <a href="http://www.international.ucla.edu/eas/documents/indonesia-const.htm">Constitution</a> [text] by denying basic human rights without due process of the law. In June, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-indonesia-to-respect-free-expression.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to release secession activists and adhere to international standards of free speech. In April, the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/indonesia-constitutional-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial anti-blasphemy law enacted in 1965 by the first Indonesian president. The court rejected the legal challenge raised by a coalition of human rights groups and social activists supporting the Wahid Organization, a civil organization that advocates for religious pluralism in Indonesia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/us/01farmers.html?src=twrhp">settlements include</a> [AP report] $3.4 billion to resolve claims that the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] <a href="http://www.doi.gov/archive/indiantrust.html">mismanaged funds</a> [DOI materials] held in trust for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Indian+Trust+Settlement">American Indian landowners</a> [JURIST news archive], and $1.2 billion for African American farmers claiming they suffered racial discrimination in US <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] loan programs. Elouise Cobell, the lead plaintiff in the Indian Trust class action lawsuit, <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/index.php">praised</a> [press release] Tuesday's vote, saying: <blockquote>By Congress placing a seal of approval on this settlement, a monumental step has been taken to remove a stain on our national honor, and create a better future for Indians as our government begins to make some amends for grave past injustices. This unprecedented Congressional action paves the way for a brighter and better relationship with government. There is still much to be done in trust reform and improving trustee performance by the Department of Interior, but this huge step makes those other steps possible. While the money is not as much as we believe we are entitled to...the settlement will be recognized by Native People as an acknowledgment by the federal government that it wronged them by its mismanagement of Indian money and Indian lands.</blockquote>The House has twice approved the settlements, which have been held up in the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] until being <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/senate-approves-minority-farmer-settlements.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] last week. President Barack Obama has stated his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/19/statement-president-senate-passage-claims-settlement-act-2010">intent to sign the bill into law</a> [press release]. 

<p>In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-extends-deadline-for-congress-to-approve-indian-trust-settlement.php">extended the deadline</a> [JURIST report] for Congress to approve the Indian Trust settlement to January 7, 2011, marking the <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/docs/key_docs.php">seventh time</a> [case materials] an extension had been granted since the settlement was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. The settlements arose from two cases. Cobell originally filed litigation in 1996 related to DOI's alleged mismanagement of the Indian Trust, which was established by Congress in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases to Indian lands. Although it was determined that the US government had not engaged in fraud, it was held that DOI unreasonably delayed accounting of the trust. In 1999, black farmers alleged in <a href="http://www.bfaa-us.org/pigford-v-glickman.html">Pigford v. Glickman</a> [BFAA backgrounder] that they were being denied USDA farm loans or forced to wait longer for loan approval than were non-minority farmers. The USDA and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/usda-reaches-125-billion-settlement-in.php">$1.2 billion settlement</a> [JURIST report] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The seven suspects in Barcelona, six Pakistanis and one Nigerian, are accused of <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/12/01/barcelona/1291160758.html">providing stolen passports</a> [<em>El Mundo</em> report, in Spanish] to the Pakistani militant group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder], which allegedly coordinated the attacks. The men are suspected of stealing passports and other identification documents belonging to male tourists between the ages of 20 and 30, then sending the documents to Thailand where they would be forged and then forwarded to terrorist groups. The Spanish <a href="http://www.policia.es/index.php">National Police</a> [official website, in Spanish] spent over a year investigating the movement of stolen passports from Spain to Thailand and cooperated with international police organizations in uncovering the terrorist cell. 

<p>Suspects connected to the Mumbai terror attacks continue to face arrest and prosecution.

The suit was filed in September by <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> and the <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/">Center for Food Safety</a> [advocacy websites] on behalf of a coalition of farmers, consumers,and conservation groups after the US <a href="http://">Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] revealed that it allowed the crop to be planted without the environmental review required under the  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National 
Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials]. Judge Jeffrey White of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] held that allowing the crop to stay in the ground would cause irreparable harm due to insufficient containment and cross-contamination. The sugar beets in question are one of several "Round-up Ready" crops genetically-engineered by <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [official website] to be resistant to herbicide. The creation of these crops has lead to <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/2010/11/30/federal-court-orders-first-ever-destruction-of-a-gmo-crop-orders-removal-of-genetically-engineered-sugar-beet-seed-crop/">greater use of herbicide</a> [press release] and the creation of herbicide-resistant weeds through cross-contamination. Addressing this issue, White noted that "farmers and consumers would likely suffer harm from cross-contamination" between GE sugar beets and non-GE crops, and, therefore, injunctive relief was required. White delayed implementation of the order until December 7 to allow time for an appeal.

<p>Monsanto <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-injunction-against-genetically-modified-seed.php">escaped an injunction</a> [JURIST report] in a similar case decided in June by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>]. The case arose over an injunction against the planting of Monsanto's "Roundup Ready alfalfa," pending an environmental impact statement (EIS) under NEPA. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/24/07-16458.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that NEPA plaintiffs are specially exempt from the requirement of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to obtain an injunction, affirming the nationwide injunction. Justice Samuel Alito, writing the opinion of the court, reversed the circuit court's ruling, stating that NEPA violations, absent unusual circumstances, are not exempt from the standard four-factor test to determine the availability of injunctive relief. The test requires the plaintiff has suffered an irreparable injury, adequate alternative remedies are not available, a remedy of equity is warranted and it serves the public interest. Alito concluded that the respondent plaintiffs were unable to show that a partial deregulation would pose any appreciable risk of environmental harm if the scope of the regulation is sufficiently limited.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote comes a day after the Illinois <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 62-51 in favor of the bill, which will now go to <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> (D) [official website] for his signature. Quinn is <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/2937844,civil-unions-pass-senate-illinois-120110.article">expected to sign the bill</a> [<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> report]. The legislation, entitled the "Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act," seeks to provide "adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union" as well as to provide "persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses." Additionally, it would allow religious institutions within the state to choose whether to observe or officiate the union. If signed by Quinn, the legislation will take effect in July 2011. Opponents have cited the fear that its passage is one step closer to the legalization of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive], which remains a hotly debated issue throughout the US.

<p>In September, 13 state attorneys general <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/states-file-amicus-brief-against-california-same-sex-marriage-decision.php">joined in an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overturn a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">federal district court decision</a> [JURIST report] striking down California's ban on same-sex marriage. The brief argued that the district court exceeded its authority because a federal court cannot "reorder this foundational legal and social institution." In July, Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov">Governor Linda Lingle</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed same-sex civil unions. In contrast, several jurisdictions in the US have legalized same-sex marriage. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">DC</a> became the sixth US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriages, joining <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, filed by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website], alleged that Congress had exceeded its constitutional powers by mandating that employers provide health insurance or face financial penalties, requiring individuals to purchase health insurance, and that the law violates the university's religious beliefs because the penalties could be used to fund <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Judge Norman Moon, citing a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">similar ruling</a> [JURIST report] in a Michigan federal court, found that the mandate provisions were constitutional under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Concerning the second issue, Moon ruled that the plaintiffs had not raised a plausible claim that the law is a burden to religious practices.<blockquote>[Plaintiffs] fail to allege how any payments required under the Act, whether fines, fees, taxes, or the cost of the policy, would be used to fund abortion. Indeed, the Act contains strict safeguards at multiple levels to prevent federal funds from being used to pay for abortion services beyond those in cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the woman would be endangered. Furthermore, at least one plan that does not cover non-excepted abortion services will be offered for enrollment through each of the state health benefit exchanges, as required by the Act. Moreover, the Act specifically allows plans in the exchanges to decline to cover all abortion services whatsoever, including excepted abortion services.</blockquote>Liberty University will appeal the decision immediately to the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>The health care reform law is the subject of numerous legal challenges across the country. In October, a federal judge in Florida <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text], committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. In August, a federal judge allowed a similar lawsuit filed in Virginia to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/080210healthcareop.pdf">proceed on narrow grounds</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">report</a>], addressing only <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/subject_matter_jurisdiction">subject matter jurisdiction</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the legal sufficiency of the complaint. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Urrutikoetxea is a former member of the Basque regional parliament and led the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/eta.htm">ETA</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eta">news archive</a>] until 2006. He was <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2010/12/01/French-court-sentences-Basque-leader/UPI-65421291214800/">convicted and sentenced <em>in absentia</em></a> [UPI report] by the court after his fingerprints were found in ETA apartments and on a vehicle in France. Urrutikoetxea was <a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/europe/20101201-former-eta-leader-sentenced-prison-france">sentenced to five years</a> [RFI report] in his original trial. The appeals court maintained the warrant for his arrest, and he is to be detained upon entering any French territory. 

<p>Recent news reports form Spain have stated that Urrutikoetxea is seeking to regain his leadership in the ETA in the upcoming weeks. He has stated that he is willing to talk with Spanish authorities and has been in communication with Arnaldo Otegi, a former leader of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>], the political wing of ETA. In March, the Spanish <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-court-sentences-former-basque.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Otegi to two years in prison for promoting terrorism. The court held that comments made by Ortegi in a 2005 speech praised the terrorist acts committed by other ETA members. Otegi compared his imprisoned associates to South African leader <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html">Nelson Mandela</a> [ANC backgrounder]. The court criticized the comparison because, unlike the ETA, which is blamed for more than 800 deaths, Mandela was nonviolent. The court also disqualified Otegi from holding public office for 16 years. Otegi faces additional charges that could result in up to 30 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Department of the Navy</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] on the ability of the government to withhold information under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. The issue is whether 5 USC &#167; 552(b)(2) (Exemption 2), which allows a government agency to keep secret only documents related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency, must be strictly construed to preclude the "High 2" expansion created by some circuits but rejected by others. Petitioner Glen Scott Milner filed two FOIA requests for information about a US Navy magazine near his home, but the Navy withheld certain documents under Exemption 2. The US Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/08/05/07-36056.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the Navy, ruling that Exemption 2 encompasses two exemptions&#8212;the "Low 2" exemption, which covers ordinary employment matters, and the "High 2" exemption, which covers materials whose "disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation." Counsel for the petitioner argued four main points:<blockquote>First, the plain language of Exemption 2 dictates an extremely narrow category of materials, those related solely to internal personnel policies and rules. Second, even if you look beyond the plain language and look to the legislative history, the legislative history is focused, and the additional legislative history from the House is focused, only on law enforcement or investigatory materials, items that were covered through the 1986 amendments to FOIA, making any additional judicial High 2 unnecessary. The third point: Because of FOIA's purpose, if you find that the language, the plain language, is not clear or if you find that the legislative history isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy. And finally, Congress in enacting FOIA conducted the balancing. It reserved for it, itself, the authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3. It did not leave agency discretion available for the agencies to decide what documents they can provide or not.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that "[p]etitioner has asked this Court to disrupt 30 years of FOIA practice by rejecting an interpretation of Exemption 2 that has prevailed and has provided a workable standard for agencies and the courts since the D.C. Circuit's en banc decision in Crooker."

<p>Also Wednesday, the court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-529.pdf">Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-credit-card-notice-issue.php">report</a>] on whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxi">Eleventh Amendment</a> [text] prevents an independent state agency from bringing an action in federal court against state officials to remedy a violation of federal law. The state of Virginia participates in a federal program designed to detect abuse and neglect at state-run medical facilities. The petitioner is the state agency given oversight over the medical facilities and is seeking access to records relevant to the deaths of two individuals who were residents of the state-run facilities. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the suit by the petitioner was barred under the Eleventh Amendment and did not fall within the <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/209/123/case.html">Ex parte Young</a> [opinion text] doctrine.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/policereformandsocialresponsibility.html">Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill</a> [materials, text] would amend the current procedures under which victims of an alleged war crime can receive an arrest warrant under the UK <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=universal+jurisdiction">news archive</a>] laws. The bill would remove the exclusive power of granting arrest warrants from local magistrates, requiring that all such warrants receive approval from the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> (DPP) [official profile]. The amendment is seen as a move by the UK government to improve relations with Israel after several Israeli government officials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-officers-abandon-uk-visit.php">forced to cancel</a> [JURIST report] a trip to the UK earlier this year out of fears of being arrested. The bill states:<blockquote>Where a person who is not a public prosecutor lays an information before a justice of the peace in respect of an offense to which this subsection applies, no warrant shall be issued under this section without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. ... Subsection (4A) applies to (a) a qualifying offense which is alleged to have been committed outside the United Kingdom, or (b) an ancillary offense relating to a qualifying offense where it is alleged that the qualifying offense was, or would have been, committed outside the United Kingdom.</blockquote>Advocacy groups believe that the amendment <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/dec/01/police-reform-bill-amnesty">makes the UK look soft on crime.</a> [<em>Guardian</em>report] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] was particularly critical of the bill, calling it a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19120">dangerous and unnecessary change</a> [press release]. 

<p>UK officials had promised Israel that a change in the law was coming for some time. Former UK attorney general Patricia Janet Scotland gave a speech early this year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, stating that UK officials were <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/cgi-bin/dovrut/dovrut_search_eng.pl?mesge126268782732688760">working to resolve the issue</a> [press release] and protect senior officials traveling to the UK. Last December, former Israeli foreign minister <a href="http://tzipilivni.co.il/">Tzipi Livni</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a UK trip</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on war crimes charges relating to Israel's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">Gaza offensive</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October 2009, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/11/Lieutenant-General%20Moshe%20Ya-alon">Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-cabinet-minister-cancels-uk-trip.php">called off</a> [JURIST report] a scheduled trip to the UK after legal advisers from the Israeli <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] said that he may be arrested over his involvement in a 2002 airstrike that killed a Hamas leader and 14 civilians. In September, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/israel-asks-un-rights-committee-to-cease-probe-into-2008-2009-gaza-conflict.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] investigation into Israeli actions during the 2008-2009 Gaza campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Proposition 8 supporters had sought Reinhardt's disqualification because of his wife's role as executive director of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] for Southern California, which has been involved in the Proposition 8 battle both publicly and in a private consulting capacity. The motion argued that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/455.html">28 USC &#167; 455</a> [text] requires Reinhardt to step down, even if he does not feel or act with a bias. Reinhardt denied the motion, writing, "I am certain that "a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would [not] conclude that [my] impartiality might reasonably be questioned," noting that he has recused himself in other cases "when doing so was warranted by the circumstances." The Proposition 8 supporters do <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120203494.html">not plan to appeal</a> [AP report]. Arguments are scheduled for Monday. 

<p>A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report in August. In October, lawyers representing the city of San Francisco submitted a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/18/10-16696_answering_brief.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] arguing that Proposition 8 is <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/city-of-san-francisco-lawyers-argue-proposition-8-irrational-under-california-law.php">irrational under California state law</a> [JURIST report]. In September, officials in Imperial County, California, also <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-county-commences-appeal-of-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">submitted a brief</a> [JURIST report] appealing the federal court's decision finding Proposition 8 unconstitutional. The appeal came just days after supporters of Proposition 8 <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/proposition-8-supporters-seek-standing-to-appeal.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] seeking standing in order to file the appeal. Earlier in the month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/courtsofappeal/3rdDistrict/">California Court of Appeal, 3rd Appellate District</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-appeals-court-refuses-to-order-state-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that neither <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/about/arnold">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> nor <a target="_blank" href="http://ag.ca.gov/ag/brown.php">Attorney General Jerry Brown</a> [official websites] is required to appeal the decision of the district court. In August, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">issued a stay</a> [JURIST report] of district court's decision, pending appeal. Schwarzenegger, Brown and others <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">filed motions</a> [JURIST report] opposing the stay request. Schwarzenegger and Brown were originally defendants in the lawsuit, and their refusal to oppose the stay left defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law. The remaining defendant-intervenors have indicated they will, if necessary, appeal the case to the US Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed regulations, if adopted by Congress, would be the first open Internet rules in the nation. The proposal would require transparency of Internet broadband networks to help consumers make better decisions about services, preserve open access to all lawful Internet content and protect freedom of speech in the "marketplace of ideas" online. FCC Chairman <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] stressed the potential impact of the plan:<blockquote>This framework, if adopted later this month, would advance a set of core goals: It would ensure that the Internet remains a powerful platform for innovation and job creation; it would empower consumers and entrepreneurs; it would protect free expression; it would increase certainty in the marketplace, and spur investment both at the edge and in the core of our broadband networks.</blockquote>The plans also set a national goal for achieving universal high-speed Internet in the near future. Telecommunications companies may <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/chief+backs+some+rationing+Internet+traffic/3917256/story.html">oppose</a> [Reuters report] the new rules, having previously questioned the scope of the FCC's power in regulating the Internet. The FCC will vote on the proposal on December 21.

<p>The FCC has been trying to exert more control over Internet regulation. In July, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] introduced <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/demint.net.neutrality.bill.072110.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/senators-introduce-legislation-to-block-fcc-broadband-plan.php">report</a>] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] found that the FCC lacks the power to enforce <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">net neutrality</a> [JURIST news archive]. Net neutrality, which is <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">unanimously supported</a> [JURIST report] by the FCC's commissioners, is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. Telecommunications companies <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&#38;T</a> and <a href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites] argue that net neutrality would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Marc Rosenberg issued an extension of the stay requested by lawyers for the federal and Ontario governments to preserve the provisions that were invalidated by the lower court while the appeal process continues. The OSCJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in September that provisions <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:210">&#167; 210</a>, <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:212">&#167; 212</a> and <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:213">&#167; 213</a> of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/">Canadian Criminal Code</a> [texts], which prohibit the keeping of a "common bawdy house," engaging in communications for the purpose of soliciting sex and living "on the avails" of the sex trade, were a violation of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. The government argued that the judgment should be stayed until the court could conduct a full review of the decision, while the party challenging the laws argued that the stay would "perpetuate the law's contribution to violence against a vulnerable population." Rosenberg applied the <span class="casename">RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada</span> test for granting a stay pending appeal, which requires the court to balance convenience and public interest considerations of the issue. He concluded that it is in the public interest that the judgment be stayed for a relatively short period to permit appellate review of the decision.

<p>Although prostitution is legal in Canada, virtually all of the acts ancillary to exchanging sex for money are not. In 2007, the <a href="http://spoc.ca/">Sex Professionals of Canada</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/canada-sex-workers-to-challenge.php">initiated an application with the OSCJ</a> [JURIST report] challenging the three provisions overturned in September's ruling on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the Charter. The challenge came on the heels of the trial of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/pickton/">Robert Pickton</a> [CBC case backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.missingpeople.net/2005/pickton_indictments.htm">accused of murdering 26 women</a> [indictment text], mostly prostitutes, in the Vancouver area in the 1990s. Pickton was <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/archives/article803199.ece">convicted of six counts of murder</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] in late 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stevens <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B10MS20101202">pleaded guilty</a> [Reuters report] to aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon, wrongfully tossing a grenade out of his vehicle, making false statements to military investigators and dereliction of duty. He did not plead guilty to a fifth charge of conspiracy to commit assault. Military prosecutors originally sought a prison term of 18 months, but Stevens stuck a deal with the military prosecutors to testify against other soldiers accused of terrorizing civilians. Stevens stated that he and the other soldiers acted on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-11890392">orders from a squad leader</a> [BBC report]. The charges against Stevens stem from a probe into the 5th Stryker Brigade. Five of the twelve 12 involved in the probe are accused of premeditated murder. Stevens will serve nine months at a military brig on his home base. He will be allowed to stay in the military, but he will be demoted to E-1 private and forfeit his pay while in prison.

<p>The probe into the 5th Stryker Brigade has led to charges against several soldiers. On Monday, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">ordered a court-martial</a> [JURIST report] for Staff Sgt. David Bram. Bram is accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep him from informing about alleged drug abuse within the unit. In June, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-soldier-charged-in-civilian-deaths-in-afghanistan.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Specialist Jeremy Morlock with three counts of premeditated murder and one count of assault in the death of three Afghan civilians. The Army announced in May that its Criminal Investigation Command was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">opening an investigation into the civilian deaths</a> [JURIST report] in Kandahar. The charges are the latest in a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In April, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial. Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">reduced from 15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi civilian. In December 2009, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl. Green was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-sentences-ex-us-soldier.php">sentenced to five consecutive life terms</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a party to the ICC's <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [materials], the country is obligated to execute al-Bashir's arrest warrant. However, reports now indicate that al-Bashir has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/africa/02briefs-Sudan.html?_r=1">canceled his trip to the Central African Republic</a> [NYT report] as well as another scheduled trip to Libya for an African-European summit as a result of the order.

<p>Other African countries that are state parties to the Rome Statute have come under fire for allowing al-Bashir to attend events in their countries without arrest. In August, Kenya welcomed al-Bashir to a celebration for the country's adoption of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">reported Kenya</a> [JURIST report] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute as a result of the country's failure to arrest al-Bashir. Former UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/annan.php">news archive</a>] urged Kenya to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/annan-questions-kenyas-icc-commitment-after-al-bashir-visit.php">reaffirm its commitment to the ICC</a> [JURIST report]. The ICC also <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc931075.pdf">reported Chad</a> [decision, PDF] for failing to arrest al-Bashir when he visited the country in July. Earlier in July, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">news archive</a>].

In a split 5-2 decision, the court held that there is no basis under Ohio law for litigating the issue of whether the lethal injection process is constitutional. The question was referred to the high court by the <a href="http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio</a> [official website] in the case of condemned prisoner Michael Scott. Scott, who was sentenced to death for killing two men in 1999, went before the court to challenge the use of lethal injection for his execution. The court found:<blockquote>Accordingly, until the General Assembly explicitly expands state review of death penalty cases by creating a methodology for reviewing Ohio's lethal-injection protocol, we must answer the certified question as follows: There is no state postconviction relief or other state-law mode of action to litigate the issue of whether a specific lethal-injection protocol is constitutional under Baze v. Rees ... or under Ohio law.</blockquote>The court said it would not hear further cases regarding lethal injection until the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/">Ohio General Assembly</a> [official website] explicitly expanded state review of death penalty cases.

<p>Ohio's newly adopted lethal injection method has faced numerous challenges, with one case reaching the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>]. In March, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate challenging the state's new single-drug execution protocol, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] last November. Ohio conducted its <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new procedure in December. The change in procedure came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> [JURIST report] of its lethal injection practices in September 2009, following the planned execution of inmate Romell Broom failed when a suitable vein for the drugs' administration could not be found. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the first presidential elections in a decade, presidential challenger Alassane Ouattara was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6B10L620101202">named the victor</a> [Reuters report], but incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">President Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] has called the results fraudulent, and the results have now been invalidated by the Constitutional Council. In 2003, the Ivory Coast accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC for crimes committed on its territory. Accordingly, Bensouda stated:<blockquote>I encourage the political leaders to call on their supporters and fellow citizens to show restraint and avoid unrest. I invite the Ivorian authorities to investigate criminal incidents that have already occurred and to do everything possible to deter future ones. All reported acts of violence will be closely scrutinized by the Office.</blockquote>There have been reports of violence in parts of the west and north, and the country has closed its borders and suspended foreign media.

<p>In February, Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the country's parliament and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Prime Minister Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] with creation of new government and new election format. Gbagbo had accused Beugre Mambe, the head of the independent electoral commission, of fraud by attempting to register more than 400,000 whom Gbagbo considers to be foreigners. Opposition parties such as the <a href="http://pdcirda.org/">Ivory Coast Democratic Party</a> (PDCI) [party website, in French] and <a href="http://www.rdrci.org/actu.asp">Republican Gathering Party</a> (RDR) [party website, in French] said that most of those voters are ethnic groups in the north of the country, who would likely have voted against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office through delaying six successive elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that New Mexico's current child custody law provides no legal right for a non-parent to assert custody over a child and applies only to biological and adoptive parents. Accordingly, others, such as the unmarried partner of a parent, cannot seek custody absent a finding that the legal parent is unfit. In the majority opinion, Judge James Wechsler said "[i]t is the Legislature's responsibility to expand the requirements for standing if it wishes to do so." This holding <a href="http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2010/dec/02/bc-nm-court-same-sex-partners1st-ld-writethru/?features&travel">breaks with previous decisions</a> [AP report] in New Mexico that have favored recognizing psychological parenthood relationships.

<p>The custody dispute involved former couple Bani Chatterjee and Taya King. In 2000, the couple adopted a one-year-old girl from Russia but, unsure how Russian adoption agencies would react to a same-sex couple, only King legally adopted the child. King and Chatterjee separated in 2008. Contending she shared in raising the couple's child for nine years and shared a parent-child relationship with King's daughter, Chatterjee filed suit in a state district court asking a judge to declare her a parent and decide custody and visitation. The judge, however, dismissed the case. Other jurisdictions have struggled with similar issues. Last year, a New York state appeals court ruled that a same-sex partner <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-partner.php">lacks standing to assert parental rights</a> [JURIST report] over the biological child of her partner unless she has adopted the child. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In light of escalating post-election violence, the Guinean government <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ICC-prosecutor-condemns-Guinea-post-election-violence.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] last month, just three days after Conde was provisionally declared the winner by the electoral commission. The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE6B215J20101203">confirmation of the election results</a> [Reuters report] by the Supreme Court was to bring the state of emergency to an end. Cellou Dalein Diallo, Conde's presidential rival, also conceded defeat on Friday. 

<p>In November, the deputy prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], Fatou Bensouda, issued a <a href="/paperchase/Guinea%20statement.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ICC-prosecutor-condemns-Guinea-post-election-violence.php">lamenting the killing of seven people</a> [JURIST report] in a post-election violence in Guinea. Bensouda urged security forces to refrain from using excessive force against civilians. The statement asserted that the ICC would evaluate all reported acts of violence resulting from the crackdown. November's election ended two years of military rule under a transitional government formed by military captain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who staged a coup in the wake of the death of former president <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/23/lansana-conte-profile">Lansana Conte</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], the nation's ruler for 24 years.

Bribes amounting to USD $180 million were allegedly given to Nigerian government officials so that KBR could obtain the $6 billion construction contract. Cheney served as Halliburton's <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/26/politics/main575356.shtml?tag=untagged">chief executive officer from 1995 through August 2000</a> [CBS report], while the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101202/pl_afp/nigeriaoilgascorruptionus_20101202233022">bribery is alleged to have occurred from 1995 to 2005</a> [AFP report]. According to Godwin Obla, prosecuting attorney for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2010/12/02/nigeria-to-file-charges-against-dick-cheney-over-bribery/">indictments will be issued within three days</a> [WSJ report]. KBR spilt from Halliburton in 2007. In addition to Halliburton, indictments will also be issued to officials from four other foreign companies. Last year, Halliburton and KBR <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a5SIJHgE3rXA">agreed to paid a $579 million fine</a> [Bloomberg report] to resolve US criminal and regulatory violations stemming from the Bonny Island contract and bribery.  

<p>Halliburton and its subsidiaries and subcontractors have been implicated in a number of law violations. In July 2007, former Eagle Global Logistics (EGL) executive Kevin Andre Smoot <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/halliburton-subcontractor-executive.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to making a false statement and violating the Anti-Kickback Act. In 2006 EGL, a Houston-based company hired by KBR to ship military cargo to Iraq, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/August/06_civ_485.html">paid the government $4 million</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/halliburton-subcontractor-settles-iraq.php">report</a>] to settle potential claims under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sec_31_00003729----000-.html">False Claims Act</a> [text] that it inflated invoices for Iraq military cargo shipments. EGL was accused of charging a "war risk surcharge" on military shipments from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Iraq between November 2003 and July 2004. In November 2006, KBR <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2006/November/06_civ_797.html">settled fraud allegations</a> [DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/halliburton-subsidiary-settles-kosovo.php">report</a>] under the False Claims Act and agreed to pay the US $8 million for allegedly overcharging the Army for logistical support it provided between 1999 and 2000. The DOJ alleged that KBR double-billed the military and delivered non-conforming goods to be used for the construction of Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. According to a report issued in October 2006, KBR <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/halliburton-subsidiary-breaking-iraq.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/">Federal Acquisition Regulation</a> (FAR) [official website] directive on classifying proprietary data by claiming protection for information normally in the public sphere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the statement, the prosecutor will obtain arrest warrants for the individuals behind these threats if they persist. Within the next two weeks, Moreno-Ocampo plans to present two cases against the six individuals involved in the 2007 post-election violence. These six people allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icc-to-present-cases-against-instigators-of-kenya-post-election-violence.php">"bear the greatest responsibility"</a> [JURIST report] for the post-election violence. There has been much speculation about who the six people will be, but it is <a href="http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2010/12/03/icc-reports-witness-intimidation-in-kenya/">anticipated</a> [VOA report] that they will be high-ranking officials in Kenya and influential businessmen. 

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.knchr.org/">Kenya National Commission on Human Rights</a> (KNCHR) [advocacy website], which implicated former Cabinet minster William Ruto of interfering with the ICC investigation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-rights-group-accuses-official-of-interfering-with-icc-election-investigation.php">denied accusations that it had bribed witnesses</a> [JURIST report]. Two witnesses, Ken Braziz Wekesa and William Kepkemboi Rono, <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1051352/-/item/1/-/mvq88b/-/index.html">claimed they were bribed by the KNCHR</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em> report], a government-funded human rights group, to testify to the ICC against Ruto, the former higher education minister. Moreno-Campo said that the court will <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-prosecutor-says-court-will-not-use-testimony-of-allegedly-bribed-kenya-witnesses.php">not use testimony</a> [JURIST report] from three Kenyan witnesses who claim they were bribed to provide false evidence against a high-ranking government official. In September, Kenyan businessman Joseph Gathungu filed a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kenya-businessman-challenges-legality-of-icc-investigation.php">challenging the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of the ICC investigation into the violence following the 2007 Kenyan presidential election. The suit, which was filed in the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Kenya.htm#_The_Judiciary">High Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] in Mombasa, argues that the ICC investigation is illegal under the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">constitution adopted last month</a> [JURIST report]. Violence following the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">2007 Kenyan presidential election</a> [JURIST report] left at least 1,000 people dead and 500,000 displaced after protests erupted from allegations that <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] committed voter fraud.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The settlement was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10851376620769925503#[1]">awarded</a> [ruling] by the <a href="http://www.la4th.org/">Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in order to establish a fund meant to help Louisianans quit smoking. The ruling came after the court found the <a href="/currentawareness/tobacco.php">tobacco</a> [JURIST news archive] companies had "distort[ed] the entire body of public knowledge about the addictive effects of nicotine." The <a href="http://www.lasc.org/">Louisiana Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused to hear an appeal. The tobacco companies argue that the Louisiana court procedure for filing and examining claims in the class-action suit was "unorthodox." Specifically, the parties argue that the court did not require any class member to prove the individual elements of their claims and that the only class members to testify at trial had already quit smoking.

<p><a href="http://www.oyez.org/justices/antonin_scalia">Justice Antonin Scalia</a> [Oyez profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/scalia-stays-louisiana-class-action-ruling-against-tobacco-companies.php">stayed the Louisiana court ruling</a> [JURIST report] in September in his role as Circuit Justice for the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The stay prevented the companies from having to carry out the decision. Scalia indicated that it was likely the Supreme Court would grant <em>certiorari</em>, there was a "significant possibility" of reversal, there was a likelihood of irreparable harm without the stay and the ruling raised due process concerns. Philip Morris has faced other class action litigation related to its sales practices. In 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-decertifies-class.php">overturned class action certification</a> [JURIST report] for a lawsuit brought by "light" cigarette smokers against Philip Morris and other light cigarette makers. The class action, which included anyone who has ever bought light cigarettes since they hit the market in the 1970s, had alleged that tobacco companies used deceptive advertising tactics to mislead smokers in response to growing health concerns over the risks of smoking cigarettes. In September 2006, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-certifies-class-of-light.php">certified the class of 50 million plaintiffs</a> [JURIST report] for the class-action suit. Lawyers estimated that sales of light cigarettes brought tobacco companies between $120 billion and $200 billion in extra sales since 1971.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Commandant of the Marine Corps <a href="http://www.marines.mil/unit/hqmc/cmc/Pages/OfficialBiography.aspx">General James Amos</a> [official profile] urged the Committee to delay the policy's repeal, arguing that ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan would complicate the integration of openly gay service members at this time. Amos' sentiments were echoed by the Chiefs of Staff for the Army and Air Force, Generals <a href="http://www.army.mil/leaders/csa/">George Casey, Jr.</a> and <a href="http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=7077">Norton Schwartz</a> [official profiles], respectively. Chief of Naval Operations <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio_ldr.asp?bioID=253&tid=5">Admiral Gary Roughead</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/flag/docs/cg00.pdf">Admiral Robert Papp, Jr.</a> [official profile, PDF], Commandant of the Coast Guard, however, joined Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/biography.aspx?ID=10">General James Cartwright</a> [official profile] in offering a more optimistic perspective. Acknowledging that difficulties will follow repeal, Cartwright reiterated his belief in the military's inclusivity, saying:<blockquote>Waiting for a more ideal time to decide this question is obviously one option; however, difficult tasks are rarely well served by delay. It is hard to foresee a time when the men and women of the U.S. military will be more focused and disciplined than they are today.  We must be prudent in our approach, but there is little to suggest that the issues associated with a change in the law and [Department of Defense] policy will diminish if we wait on the uncertain promise of a less challenging future.</blockquote>Regardless of their individual views, each emphasized their readiness to implement the repeal if so ordered.

<p>The SASC hearing was the second in as many days to review a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130(secure-hires).pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/dod-concludes-little-negative-impact-to-repealing-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>], released earlier this week, that concluded that repealing DADT would only minimally effect military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. The DOD also released a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport-SPI_FINAL_20101130(secure-hires).pdf">Support Plan for Implementation</a> [text, PDF], laying out the Comprehensive Review Working Group's recommendations to proceed with the repeal in a form similar to a military operations order. Last week, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. In November, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. Gates issued a memorandum in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior DOD officials. In September, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">rejected a cloture motion</a> [JURIST report] on a defense appropriations bill that would have repealed the policy.

Many cables display China's obsession with the threat of the Internet, the government's attempts at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+Internet">censorship</a> [JURIST news archive] and the opportunities hacking provided to obtain secrets of its rivals, namely the US. A cable from earlier this year revealed that China's senior propaganda official <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/leadership/html/9.stm">Li Changchun</a> [BBC profile] directed an attack on Google servers in the US. According to a source with close elite connections, Li and China's top security official <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/leadership/html/10.stm">Zhou Yongkang</a> [BBC profile] personally oversaw the hacking of <a href="http://www.google.cn/">google.cn</a> [search website]. A secret cable from the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] warned employees of hacking attempts by China during the 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=un+climate+change">climate change talks</a> [JURIST report]. The cables also reveal that individuals linked to the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/pla.htm">People's Liberation Army</a> [GlobalSecurity background] conducted a hacking scheme in 2008 that produced more than 50 megabytes of e-mail messages, user names and passwords from an unidentified US government agency. Other cables reveal China's concerns regarding <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">Google Earth</a> [mapping website] satellite mapping and the lack of censorship by Google's search engine.

<p>WikiLeaks is a website which purports to be a not-for-profit media organization that anonymously publishes leaked classified government documents. It has recently come under controversy due to a string of leaked documents. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official websites] said last week they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/doj-announces-wikileaks-criminal-investigation.php">conducting criminal investigations</a> [JURIST report] into WikiLeaks over its release of confidential government communications. Last month, Google urged the international community to <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/trade_free_flow_of_information.pdf&pli=1&chrome=true">ensure the free flow of online information</a> [white paper text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-calls-for-global-trade-rules-to-limit-internet-restrictions.php">report</a>] by establishing new rules to protect against limitations on the Internet. In September, the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China</a> [official website, in Chinese] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-government-cites-human-rights-improvements.php">released a position paper</a> [JURIST report] claiming that it has heightened Internet freedoms and describing how the Internet has become a tool for the Chinese government to promote transparency and consult the public before developing certain policies. While the government said freedom of speech is protected on the Internet, it also attached value to the Internet's role in supervision. In July, a Chinese government official said that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/google-agreed-to-follow-chinese-censorship-laws-official.php">Google had agreed to follow Chinese censorship laws</a> [JURIST report] to gain a license renewal that would still prevent users from accessing sites that threatened national security, while not requiring Google to censor its China or Hong Kong based websites. This <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-to-stop-redirecting-china-users-to-unfiltered-hong-kong-search-engine.php">agreement was reached</a> [JURIST report] in June after a dispute concerning Google's practice of redirecting mainland users to the Hong Kong-based website as a means of working around censorship laws. China responded by <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">reiterating its commitment to open Internet</a> [JURIST report], but stressing that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. In February, the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">announced new regulations</a> [JURIST report] further restricting Internet use by requiring Chinese citizens to submit identity cards and meet with regulars before registering a website, prompting many to register sites overseas to avoid regulation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Conde said on state television that <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6B401T20101205?sp=true">reconciliation was essential to rebuild</a> [Reuters report] the volatile country. The commission will be modeled on South Africa's <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> [official website] created by Nelson Mandela after the fall of apartheid. The commission is likely to be well received by human rights groups. Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that, when responding to violence during the elections last month, Guinea used excessive force and lacked political neutrality. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/29/guinea-witnesses-describe-security-force-excesses">urged the new government</a> [press release], headed by Conde to:<blockquote><ul>
	<li>Bring to justice those responsible for the gross abuses, both in connection with election-related violence, and the killings of more than 150 opposition supporters and rapes of 100 women by security forces in September 2009; ...</li>
	<li>Establish a truth-telling mechanism to uncover the roots of ethnic violence, investigate the historical persecution of particular ethnic groups, explore the dynamics that gave rise to and sustained cycles of successive authoritarian and abusive regimes, and make recommendations to ensure better governance and prevent a repetition of past violations; ... and </li>
	<li>Ensure that those responsible for inciting and carrying out violence are investigated and held accountable, including members of both political parties.</li>
</ul></blockquote>Last week, the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Guinea.htm">Guinea Supreme Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/guinea-high-court-declares-conde-winner-of-presidential-election.php">validated</a> [JURIST report] that Conde won the presidency in the first free election since the country's independence from France. 

<p>After the first presidential election in June, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/guinea-high-court-announces-election-results.php">no candidate received enough votes to claim a majority</a> [JURIST report], and a runoff was held between former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo and Conde. The election came at the conclusion of 18 months of governance by a military junta, which took power in a 2008 coup. The coup followed the death of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7796741.stm">Lansana Conte</a> [BBC profile], who had ruled the West African country since 1984. In May, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) sent a delegation from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) [official websites] to Guinea to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-prosecutors-investigating-2009-military-violence-in-guinea.php">further investigate the killing</a> [JURIST report] of more than <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280603.stm">150 pro-democracy protesters in Conakry</a> [BBC backgrounder] in September 2009. The protesters had rallied against Guinean military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who announced in October that he intended to push elections forward three months and stand for election, breaking a promise not to run made shortly after he took power. An assassination attempt on Camara two months later eventually drove him into exile.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Special Judge of ATC Rana Nisar Ahmed Khan <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010\12\05\story_5-12-2010_pg1_4">issued non-bailable warrants</a> [<em>Daily Times</em> post] for the arrests of former police chief of the city of Rawalpindi, Syed Saud Aziz and one of his deputies, Khurram Shahzad. Special prosecutor Chaudry Zulfiqar Ali had argued that the officers <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=12315995&page=1">failed to adequately provide</a> [Reuters report] for Bhutto's security and ordered the crime scene hosed down. The court will resume hearings on December 11, when it will also charge five others who have already been arrested. 

<p>The Pakistani government and police forces have been criticized before for their part in Bhutto's assassination. In April, the independent UN commission formed to investigate the assassination <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-commission-report-blames-pakistan.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] holding the Pakistani government and police forces responsible for failing to provide adequate security. The report also accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into the assassination. The three-member commission was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/un-names-bhutto-assassination.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009. Members included former Chilean Ambassador to the UN Heraldo Munoz, former attorney general of Indonesia Marzuki Darusman, and Peter Fitzgerald, a former deputy police commissioner in the Irish National Police who has served with the UN in other capacities. Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack in December 2007 that claimed the lives of at least 20 other people. At that time, Bhutto was the head of the opposition <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People's Party</a>, which was challenging then-prime minister Pervez Musharraf's <a href="http://www.pml.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid</a> (PML-Q) [party websites] in the lead-up to parliamentary elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=6624">ruled</a> [<em>The News</em> report] on a petition filed by a citizen, which argued that parliament does not have the right to amend the law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been ignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year.

The court found Hategekimana <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101206/wl_africa_afp/rwandagenocideuncourt">guilty</a> [AFP report] of three counts of genocide stemming from his involvement in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>], specifically in the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the Rwandan town of Butare. Hategekimana was also convicted on one count of crimes against humanity for his role in the murder of several others and one woman's rape, and acquitted of one count of complicity in genocide. The ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/dnpnp-ictr-refuses-suspected-war.php">retained jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over Hategekimana in 2008 when it declined to transfer the trial to Rwandan domestic courts, citing concerns regarding the country's criminal justice system.  

<p>Last month, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ictr-convicts-former-rwanda-businessman-on-genocide-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan businessman Gaspard Kanyarukiga on charges of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced the 65-year-old to 30 years in prison. The ICTR's work has recently been hampered by a lack of resources, leading the tribunal to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-war-crimes-tribunals-ask-general-assembly-for-more-resources.php">ask the UN for assistance</a> [JURIST report] in October. In September, the ICTR opened the trial of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-opens-trial-of-ex-mayor.php">former Kivumu mayor</a> [JURIST report] charged in connection with deaths at a church in that town in April 1994. The tribunal has faced adversity since its creation, including the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ictr-defense-lawyer-shot-dead.php">shooting death</a> [JURIST report] of one of the senior defense lawyers in July. Earlier this year, Joseph Nzirorea, former president of the Rwanda National Assembly and secretary general of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-ex-official-dies-while-facing-genocide-trial-at-ictr.php">died while on trial</a> [JURIST report] for conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> [text].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/12/06/concorde-crash-ruling.html?ref=rss">found</a> [CBC report] that a piece of metal fell off a Continental plane and onto the runway, later causing damage to the Concorde that led to the crash. The court also convicted Continental mechanic John Taylor for improperly maintaining the plane that used the runway prior to the Concorde, sentencing him to a 15-month suspended sentence and a <span class="caps">USD </span>$2,670 fine. Continental was ordered to pay Air France <span class="caps">USD </span>$1.44 million for damage to its reputation and fines of roughly <span class="caps">USD </span>$267,000. Additionally, the court awarded several civil parties <span class="caps">USD </span>$362,000 in damages to be paid by Continental and Taylor. The other defendants, including two former high-ranking Concorde employees and the retired head of the French aviation authority, were acquitted. Continental stated that it intends to appeal the ruling.

<p>The trial, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-begins-concorde-jet-crash.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in February, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1247890/Air-France-Concorde-crash-trial-opens-Paris.html">faced criticism</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] for starting a decade after the accident and after victims' families received settlements in 2001 and the Concorde jet was officially retired by all airlines in 2003.

Dukes</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Brief-09-23-10-093139.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a massive gender discrimination class action lawsuit. The issues are (1) whether claims for monetary relief can be certified under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2)</a> [text] and, if so, under what circumstances; and (2) whether the class certification ordered under rule 23(b)(2) was consistent with rule 23(a). The case was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contend that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wal-mart-appeals-class-action-certification-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court in August after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST reports] in April. The certified class, which in 2001 was estimated to comprise more than 1.5 million women, includes all women employed by Wal-Mart nationwide at any time after December 26, 1998, making this the largest class action lawsuit in US history.

<p>Also Monday, the court agreed to hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-174.htm">American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Pet.10-174.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], regarding whether electric utilities contributed to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=global+warming">global warming</a> [JURIST news archive]. The questions presented are:<ol><li>Whether States and private parties have standing to seek judicially-fashioned emissions caps on five utilities for their alleged contribution to harms claimed to arise from global climate change caused by more than a century of emissions by billions of independent sources.</li><br />
<li>Whether a cause of action to cap carbon dioxide emissions can be implied under federal common law where no statute creates such a cause of action, and the Clean Air Act speaks directly to the same subject matter and assigns federal responsibility for regulating such emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency.</li><br />
<li>Whether claims seeking to cap defendants' carbon dioxide emissions at "reasonable" levels, based on a court's weighing of the potential risks of climate change against the socioeconomic utility of defendants' conduct, would be governed by "judicially discoverable and manageable standards" or could be resolved without "initial policy determination[s] of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion."</li></ol>The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled last year that <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/second-circuit-rules-states-may-sue.php">states can sue power companies for emitting carbon dioxide</a>, reversing a district court <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/environmental-brief-federal-judge.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] that found the plaintiffs' claim was a non-justiciable political question. The lawsuit was brought by eight states&#8212;California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin&#8212;as well as New York City and three land trusts, against coal-burning utilities <a href="http://www.aep.com/">American Electric Power</a>, <a href="http://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a>, <a href="http://www.xcelenergy.com/Company/Pages/Home.aspx">Xcel Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.duke-energy.com/residential.asp">Cinergy Corporation</a> [corporate websites] and the <a href="http://www.tva.gov/">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shinseki</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] on the time limits for seeking judicial review of the denial of a veteran's claim for disability benefits. The issue is whether the time limit in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode38/usc_sec_38_00007266----000-.html">38 USC &#167; 7266(a)</a> [text] constitutes a statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, or whether the time limit is instead jurisdictional and therefore bars application of that doctrine. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-7006.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the decision of the US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which held that the 120-day appeal period set forth in &#167; 7266(a) is not subject to equitable tolling and dismissed veteran David Henderson's claim for benefits. Counsel for Henderson argued that the Federal Circuit erred for three reason:<blockquote>First, the statute contains no clear indication that the deadline is jurisdictional. Rather, the text and structure points away from a jurisdictional reading. Second, the deadline that applies to disabled and largely uncounseled veterans seeking their first day in court is not the type of deadline that Congress would be expected to rank as jurisdictional. And third, a jurisdictional reading would render some of the most disabled of veterans the least likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse off than almost all litigants in our federal system.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that "the judgment of the court of appeals should be therefore be affirmed" under the court's ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-5306.ZS.html">Bowles v. Russell</a> [opinion text].

<p>Also Monday, the court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-6822.pdf">Pepper v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] on whether a federal district judge can consider a defendant's post-sentencing rehabilitation as a permissible factor supporting a downward sentencing variance under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003553----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 3553(a)</a> [text]. The court must also determine whether, when a sentence is vacated on appeal and a new judge is assigned on remand, the new judge must follow the prior district judge's sentencing findings. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/09/07/091191P.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court's 77-month sentence of Jason Pepper for a drug offense. At the <em>certiorari</em> stage, the US government agreed with Pepper that the Eighth Circuit erred  and urged the justices to vacate and remand the case, but the court decided to take the case, leaving <em>amicus curiae</em> to argue in support of respondents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] verified that evaluations will determine if some of the incidents by North Korean forces in South Korea constitute war crimes, giving the ICC jurisdiction over the matter. According to the ICC's press release, the incidents under ICC evaluation include:<blockquote>the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island on the 23 November 2010 which resulted in the killing of South Korean marines and civilians and the injury of many others; and the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, hit by a torpedo allegedly fired from a North Korean submarine on 26 March 2010, which resulted in the death of 46 persons.</blockquote>The <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] mandates the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor to conduct preliminary examinations in order to determine if opening an investigation would meet the Rome Statute's criteria.

<p>Last week, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak called North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong, which killed four, including two civilians, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/south-korea-president-calls-norths-attack-crime-against-humanity.php">crime against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. North Korea's ongoing conflict with the South is not the only human rights issue for which the country has faced criticism. Last month, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/un-committee-condemns-north-korea-rights-violations.php">UN committee condemned</a> [JURIST report] what it called persistent, "grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights" of its own people. In March, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.13 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for grave human rights abuses. Earlier in March, UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea, <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [UN press release] <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/13session/A.HRC.13.13_En.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] to the UNHRC that North Korean human rights situation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/north-korea-rights-situation-continuing.php">continuing to deteriorate</a> [JURIST report]. This report came after Muntarbhorn's previous criticism, in October, 2009, of North Korea's <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">"abysmal"</a> [JURIST report] and ongoing human rights violations, alleging that the authoritarian government was responsible for various abuses, including torture, public executions, extensive surveillance, media censorship, women's rights violations and widespread hunger.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing was divided into two one-hour sessions, with the first section focusing on the issue of standing, and the second focusing on Proposition 8's constitutionality. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down Proposition 8</a> [JURIST report] in August. Lawyers for parties seeking to appeal, including Proposition 8 supporters <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and Imperial County, California, deputy clerk Isabel Vargas argued that their clients had standing to defend the measure, while lawyers for Proposition 8 opponents argued that there was no injury suffered by the appellants. The opponents also argued that there was no constitutional basis for denying same-sex couples the right to marry. The proceedings were televised live on C-SPAN.

<p>In October, lawyers representing the city of San Francisco submitted a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/18/10-16696_answering_brief.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] arguing that Proposition 8 is <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/city-of-san-francisco-lawyers-argue-proposition-8-irrational-under-california-law.php">irrational under California state law</a> [JURIST report]. In September, officials in Imperial County, California, also <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-county-commences-appeal-of-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">submitted a brief</a> [JURIST report] appealing the federal court's decision finding Proposition 8 unconstitutional. The appeal came just days after supporters of Proposition 8 <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/proposition-8-supporters-seek-standing-to-appeal.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] seeking standing in order to file the appeal. Earlier in the month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/courtsofappeal/3rdDistrict/">California Court of Appeal, 3rd Appellate District</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/california-appeals-court-refuses-to-order-state-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that neither <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/about/arnold">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> nor <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/ag/brown.php">Attorney General Jerry Brown</a> [official websites] is required to appeal the decision of the district court. In August, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">issued a stay</a> [JURIST report] of district court's decision, pending appeal. Schwarzenegger, Brown and others <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">filed motions</a> [JURIST report] opposing the stay request. Schwarzenegger and Brown were originally defendants in the lawsuit, and their refusal to oppose the stay left defendant-intervenors Project Marriage and other groups to defend the law. The remaining defendant-intervenors have indicated they will, if necessary, appeal the case to the US Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the "truth commission" violates equal protection by attacking only certain political individuals suspected of corruption. Critics of the court's decision argue that most of the justices were appointed by Arroyo and <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20101207-307610/SC-Ruling-junking-Truth-Commission-based-on-legal-merits-not-politics">may still be loyal</a> [<em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em> report] to the previous regime. Justice Secretary Leila De Lima <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2010/12/08/statement-of-justice-secretary-leila-m-de-lima-on-the-supreme-court-ruling-against-the-truth-commission/">criticized the ruling</a> [press release] as "a setback in the campaign against graft and corruption." The government has 15 days to appeal the decision. 

<p>Aquino <a href="paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-to-create-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">announced plans to create the commission</a> [JURIST report] over the summer, prompting a call for him to issue an executive order to make the commission official and clear up any ambiguity regarding its authority. Arroyo has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. She was elected to the lower house of parliament in April after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">receiving permission to run for the seat</a> [JURIST report] despite protests that her presidency gave her an unfair advantage. In March, Aquino and other presidential candidates criticized as "unjust" a Supreme Court ruling that allowed Arroyo to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">appoint a replacement for the retiring chief justice</a> [JURIST report] who planned to step down a week after the May presidential elections. Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] in December for the first time in 23 years in the wake of a massacre in the Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. In February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">prosecutors charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the massacre. A Manila trial court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-189.php">ordered the arrest of 189 more suspects</a> [JURIST report] in March.

Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy websites] on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain:<blockquote>But "[a] court without jurisdiction is a court without power, no matter how appealing the case for exceptions may be," and hence it is these threshold obstacles to reaching the merits of plaintiff's constitutional and statutory challenges that must be the initial focus of this Court's attention. Because these questions of justiciability require dismissal of this case at the outset, the serious issues regarding the merits of the alleged authorization of the targeted killing of a U.S. citizen overseas must await another day or another (non-judicial) forum.</blockquote>Bates found that Awlaki's father lacked standing and that the case presented a non-justiciable political question. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/court-dismisses-targeted-killing-case-procedural-grounds-without-addressing-merits">criticized the ruling</a> [press release], saying that if it is correct, "the government has unreviewable authority to carry out the targeted killing of any American, anywhere, whom the president deems to be a threat to the nation."

<p>Bates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case last month. The arguments took place on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Awlaki, a suspected member of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is believed to be linked to Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooting suspect, as well as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier in November, Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners. Awlaki is believed to be hiding in Yemen and was charged <em>in absentia</em>. US officials have labeled Awlaki as a terrorist and have placed him on a list to be captured or killed. The Yemeni government has sent forces on a counter-terrorism operation into the Province of Shabwa, where it is believed that Awlaki is hiding. In August, the ACLU and the CCR <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/treasury-department-to-issue-license-for-terror-suspect-defense.php">obtained</a> a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) license that enables them to represent Awlaki, but announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-to-continue-suit-against-terror-suspect-defense-licensing.php">still pursuing a legal challenge</a> [JURIST reports] to the licensing scheme.

The court overruled a previous decision from March that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7921415.stm">sentenced</a> [BBC report] her to three-and-a-half years in prison on charges of receiving stolen funds. All three justices ruled that there was <a href="http://www.lusakatimes.com/2010/12/07/court-acquits-regina-chiluba/">insufficient evidence</a> [<em>Lusaka Times</em> report] to find Regina Chiluba guilty of knowingly keeping the stolen items, which included large amounts of cash, an automobile and a television set, although the court also required her to return some of the property. 

<p>Frederick Chiluba was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/zambia-ex-president-acquitted-of.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] last year of charges of stealing money from the country's treasury while in office from 1991-2001. He and two Zambian businessmen faced a total of 12 counts of theft of public funds for their alleged involvement in taking $488,000 when the treasury deposited payments to two US security firms into a London bank account controlled by the Zambia Security and Intelligence Services (ZSIS). The court found insufficient evidence to convict Chiluba, but the businessmen were found guilty. Chiluba was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/former-zambia-president-to-stand-trial.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the corruption charges in February 2008. In a separate case, Chiluba was ordered by a London court in July 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-zambia-president-challenges-58m.php">to pay $58 million in fines</a> [JURIST report] to Zambia to compensate for other funds stolen during Chiluba's decade in power. The suit was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4354069.stm">brought in Britain</a> [BBC report] by Zambian officials because Chiluba and his associates held the assets in the UK and other European countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECHR found the UK and Scotland in violations of articles 10 and 13 of the <a href = "http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], which provide for the right to free expression and the right to an effective remedy, respectively. Alan Mackay, a now-retired reporter for <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/">BBC Scotland</a> [official website], sought to report on police and prosecutorial misconduct during a 2004 drug case. The judge barred Mackay and BBC Scotland from reporting on the incident during the trial, citing <a href = "http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=40&NavFrom=2&activeTextDocId=1358414&parentActiveTextDocId=1358414&showAllAttributes=0&showProsp=0&suppressWarning=0&hideCommentary=1">section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981</a> [text], and refused to allow appeal on the issue. The ECHR noted:<blockquote>[U]nder the present system, any Scottish court which makes a section 4(2) order is under no obligation to hear representations from the media and, even where it does hear such representations, there is no obligation upon it to do so within a reasonable period of time and in any event prior to the proceedings to which the section 4(2) order relates. ... The Court has repeatedly stated that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that, in that context, the safeguards guaranteed to the press are particularly important. ... When proper consideration is given to what is at stake for the media when section 4(2) orders are imposed, it becomes apparent that current Scottish practice provides too slender a basis for the safeguards which are required in this context.</blockquote>The UK may choose to appeal to the ECHR's Grand Chamber within three months. Mackay and BBC Scotland did not seek, and were not granted, any forms of relief. The <em>Independent</em> <a href = "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/human-rights-court-rules-on-reporting-2153691.html">reports</a> [text] that the Scottish government is "already working with the courts to address the issues raised by this case."

<p>Protection and rights for <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=journalist+protection">journalists</a> [JURIST news archive] continue to be of worldwide concern. In October, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/canada-supreme-court-broadens-journalists-rights-to-protect-sources.php">Canada broadened</a> [JURIST report] journalists' rights to protect sources. In April, Germany announced plans to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/germany-justice-minister-calls-for.php">enact legislation</a> [JURIST report] meant to increase freedom of the press. In February, the <a href = "http://www.althingi.is/vefur/uppla.html">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] began <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/iceland-parliament-considering-new.php">considering measures</a> [JURIST report] aimed at increasing protections for journalists and promoting freedom of speech and transparency in government. Last December, the US <a href = "http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/senate-judiciary-committe-approves.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would protect journalists' abilities to shield sources in federal court proceedings. <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] ranked Finland number one in <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&id_rubrique=1034">press freedom in 2010</a> [2010 rankings], with Iceland second, Canada twenty-first, Germany seventeenth, and the US twentieth.

The regulation was quietly enacted under the 1939 <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90p55_e.htm">Public Works Protection Act</a> (PWPA) [text] and allowed police to require anyone present in certain areas of Toronto to identify themselves or be subjected to a search. In the report, entitled "Caught in the Act," Marin concluded that, "Regulation 233/10 ... should never have been enacted. It was likely unconstitutional." In <a href="http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/media/157564/g20remarks-en.doc">remarks</a> [text, DOC] delivered Tuesday, Marin said:<blockquote>Reviving this dormant piece of legislation, coupled with the adoption of the regulation, created a legal landscape where people were detained by police and compelled to identify themselves, answer questions and submit to warrantless searches&#8212;even if they simply wanted to walk away. Responsible protesters and civil rights groups who took the trouble to educate themselves about their rights prior to the G20 had no way of knowing they were walking into a trap&#8212;they were literally caught in the Act; the Public Works Protection Act and its pernicious regulatory offspring.</blockquote>Marin recommended that the <a href="http://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/default.html">Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services</a> [official website] revise and consider replacing the PWPA, which is unique to Ontario, and that it make sure that any similar regulations are clearly communicated to the public in the future.

<p>Marin <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/canada-government-accountability-officer-to-probe-g-20-security-measures.php">launched the investigation</a> [JURIST report] in July after his office received 22 complaints regarding security measures during the G-20 summit. It was the first time the Ombudsman used social media in conducting an investigation. In September, two individuals detained during the G-20 filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/canada-g-20-protesters-file-class-action-suit-against-ag-and-toronto-police.php">class action suit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of 1,150 individuals detained during the summit. The individuals, Miranda McQuade and Mike Barber, named three defendants in the suit, the <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/">Canadian Attorney General</a>, the <a href="http://www.tpsb.ca/">Toronto Police Services Board</a> and the <a href="http://www.peelpoliceboard.ca/">Regional Municipality of Peel Police Services Board</a> [official websites]. The plaintiffs claim that law enforcement committed numerous intentional torts against those detained between June 25 and June 30. In early July, protesters in Toronto took to the streets and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/protesters-call-for-public-inquiries-into-police-activity-during-toronto-g-20.php">demanded an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into police conduct during the meeting. Soon after the conclusion of the summit, in late June, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into-g-20-security-measures.php">called for an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into police conduct and treatment of protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

First Derivative Traders</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>], a securities fraud case. The question before the court is whether a service provider can be held primarily liable in a private securities fraud suit for aiding and participating in another company's misstatements. Section 10(b) of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_exchange_act_of_1934">Securities and Exchange Act</a> [materials] prohibits any manipulation or deception in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, but it is unclear whether the liability associated with the act extends to service providers that aided in the selling of securities where misinformation was involved. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/071607.P.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court decision and allowed a class action against the petitioner to proceed, holding that a service provider may be liable for securities fraud. There is currently a circuit split on this issue.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-291.pdf">Thompson v. North American Stainless</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-soft-money-ban.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a third party is afforded protection against retaliation when they have made claims about bias in the workplace that were not directly related to their own treatment. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_21_20_VI.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 2000e-3(a) text] prohibits retaliation against a worker who has complained of bias in the workplace, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to a third party associated with the worker complaining of the bias. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0202p-06.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court's ruling and held that the statute only protects workers personally engaging in the protected activity, in this case complaining of workplace bias. The court has also been asked to decide if a civil remedy can be sought by third party, if the court of appeals ruling is upheld. </p>]]></content:encoded>

On remand from the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit found that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00004248----000-.html">Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 4248 text], which allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he or she would otherwise be released, does not violate due process. According to the act, a court would need to prove by "clear and convincing evidence" that the sex offender is still a threat to the public. The plaintiffs in the case, inmates who face civil commitment for sex offenses, argued that the low standard of proof violated due process and should be elevated to "proof beyond a reasonable doubt," the same standard used in criminal cases. However, the court emphasized that such a high standard of proof is unnecessary:<blockquote>Nothing in the Act requires that the finding of past conduct
constitute criminal behavior. By its terms, the Act mandates a finding that a person "has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation." The Act does not define the terms "sexually violent conduct" and "child molestation," which are broad enough to encompass noncriminal conduct such as unlawful, tortious conduct.</blockquote>Although the inmates argued that indefinite detention mirrored criminal imprisonment, the court insisted that, unlike criminal incarceration, the law called for the release of individuals deemed to no longer be threats to society and allowed for third parties to request the release of such individuals every six months. 

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">upheld the act</a> [JURIST report] in May in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1224">United States v. Comstock</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and remanded to the Fourth Circuit. The court said the act was constitutional because the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html">Necessary and Proper Clause</a> [text] granted Congress sufficient authority to pass such laws. A month later, the court made another decision concerning sex offenders in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1301">Carr v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-sex.php">report</a>], ruling that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002250----000-.html">failure to register provision</a> [18 USC &#167; 2250] of the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/sorna.htm">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)</a> [DOJ backgrounder] does <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-sex-offender-registration-law-does-not-apply-retroactively.php">not apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report] to offenses occurring before SORNA's enactment. The court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-adds-10-cases-to-2009.php">agreed to hear the case</a> [JURIST report] in order to reconcile a split in the reading of the statute between the Seventh and Tenth Circuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Porteous was accused of accepting bribes from lawyers while a judge in the <a href="http://sitc.senate.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], making false statements in his bankruptcy declaration and lying to Congress during his confirmation. Porteous's lawyer <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/">Jonathan Turley</a> [personal blog] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judges-impeachment-trial-begins.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that Porteous had shown poor judgment but that his actions were entirely legal. Porteous becomes just the eighth federal judge to be impeached and convicted by Congress.

<p>The US <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-house-votes-to-impeach-federal-judge.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] in March to impeach Porteous.

Porteous' decision in that case, <span class="casename">In re Liljeberg enters v.

BOA has <a href="http://mediaroom.bankofamerica.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=234503&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1505468&highlight=">agreed to pay</a> [press release] $36 million, including interest, to the parties harmed by the scheme, as well as $101 million in penalties to federal and state authorities. The order against BOA alleges that the company put at risk the tax-exempt status of the municipal securities by establishing fraudulent fair market values using "improper bidding practices" between 1998 and 2002. The settlement payments will include investigation fees for attorneys general in all 20 affected states. BOA emphasized that other companies are also under investigation and that it was the only company so far to self-report its fraudulent behavior to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/">Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice</a> [official website].

<p>BOA has been active in reaching settlement agreements with federal agencies. The SEC announced in September that a judge in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-approves-150-millisec-bank-of-america-settlement-fund.php">approved a $150 million fund</a> [JURIST report] set up by BOA in accordance with the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-approves-150-million-sec.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] reached earlier this year. The SEC had <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/sec-charges-bank-of-america-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] BOA with misleading investors regarding billions of dollars paid to <a href="http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_15125">Merrill Lynch</a> [corporate website] executives during the acquisition of the firm. The fund will be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0112024620100901">used for payouts to shareholders</a> [Reuters report] who owned BOA stock as of January 16, 2009. In June, BOA subsidiary Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. reached a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823205/100607countrywideorder.pdf">$108 million settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bank-of-america-subsidiary-reaches-108-million-settlement-with-ftc.php">report</a>] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to resolve charges that the subsidiary collected excessive fees from homeowners facing foreclosure. The agreement allows the FTC to create a fund to provide refunds to borrowers affected by Countrywide's improper fees. The settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing by BOA but required the company to stop the improper practices. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sljivancanin was convicted in 2007 of aiding and abetting the torture of non-Serb prisoners taken from Vukovar Hospital to the farm near Ovcara and sentenced to a term of five years.

Whiting</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>] on whether an Arizona statute imposing sanctions on employers that hire illegal immigrants is preempted by federal law. According to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1324(a)(h)(2)</a> [text], federal law preempts any "[s]tate or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens," except in cases of state licensing laws. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/09-115_ca9.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/ninth-circuit-rejects-challenge-to.php">report</a>] the <a href="http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">Legal Arizona Workers Act</a> [materials] on the basis that the state statute is a licensing law, which exempts it from being preempted by the federal law. Counsel for petitioners argued that:<blockquote>Congress provided for an exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to the attention of Federal authorities, problems and worker authorization, the method by which those matters should be investigated, the method by which they should be adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of Federal, exclusive Federal activity; and indeed the ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal courts of appeals.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondents argued that, "[t]hrough their police powers, States traditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct of employers within their jurisdiction to determine what conduct warrants issuance of a State license and to determine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking such a license." Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the arguments, which could result in a 4-4 split decision. Such a ruling would leave the Ninth Circuit's decision in place but would not be precedential in future cases.

<p>Also Wednesday, the court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-329.pdf">Chase Bank USA v. McCoy</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-credit-card-notice-issue.php">report</a>] on whether a creditor seeking to raise the interest rate on a credit card where the cardholder defaulted must provide the cardholder with a change in terms notice. According to <ahref="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-1400.html">Regulation Z, 12 CFR &#167; 226.9(c)</a> [text], a creditor must provide a cardholder with a change in terms notice when the contractual terms governing the account have changed. The court will determine if a change in the interest rate due to the cardholder's default falls within the terms of the statute. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/03/16/0656278.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that Regulation Z does require the creditor to provide the cardholder with a change in terms notice where the cardholder has defaulted triggering an increase in the interest rate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants are primarily high-ranking military officers, including former defense minister Herman Brady-Roche and Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, Pinochet's chief of secret police. The men are subject to international arrest warrants and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gd06CMd56sM_tNT7zCHyPN49zizQ?docId=CNG.343501a3d8255b32e4db8d6520df8bbc.431">face charges</a> [AFP report] of kidnapping, arbitrary detention and torture. While the defendants are not present in court, it is hoped that the trial will offer some justice to the victims' families. The trial is expected to finish December 17, and if convicted, the men could receive life sentences.

<p>In July, the Chilean Supreme Court released a report <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/chile-high-court-releases-report-detailing-discrepancy-in-pinochet-fortune.php">detailing the secret fortune of Pinochet</a>, estimating it at over $20 million. This report joins another on Pinochet's hidden assets <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/chile-judge-discloses-report-detailing.php">released last September</a> [JURIST report]. That report concluded that Pinochet amassed USD $25,978,602 in accounts held outside of Chile, of which $20,199,753 is suspected to have been embezzled from official funds. The September report also concluded that the <a href="http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/internacional/20090902/chile-juez-precisa-fortuna-de-pinochet_34886_56917.html">funds were accumulated</a> [Los Tiempos report, in Spanish] over the period from 1973 to 2004, when a US Senate sub-committee investigation first <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/senate-report-says-us-banks-helped.php">uncovered the accounts</a> [JURIST report]. Victim advocates say the report supports allegations that Pinochet was the recipient of bribes and had other unlawful sources of income.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a September <em>en banc</em> rehearing, the full <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ninth-circuit-dismisses-cia-rendition-suit-on-state-secrets-grounds.php">affirmed</a> the district court's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against.php">dismiss the suit</a> [JURIST reports] against Boeing subsidiary <a href="http://www.jeppesen.com">Jeppesen Dataplan</a> [corporate website] on the basis of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive]. In its petition for <em>certiorari</em>, the ACLU argued that changes in the way the state secrets privilege has been applied warrant a Supreme Court review.

<p>The plaintiffs, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">Binyam Mohamed</a> [JURIST news archive], Abou Elkassim Britel, Ahmed Agiza, Mohamed Farag Ahmaad Bashmilah and Bisher al-Rawi, alleged that Jeppesen Dataplan knowingly aided in the rendition and subsequent torture of terror suspects by the CIA. Before Jeppesen could file an answer to the original complaint, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/doj-urges-court-to-dismiss-lawsuit.php">intervened</a> [JURIST report] and asserted the state secrets privilege, arguing that fact-finding in the case could jeopardize national security. The district court dismissed the case and a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/ninth-circuit-reinstates-lawsuit.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the ruling on appeal. The DOJ then asked the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case with a full panel, and was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ninth-circuit-to-reconsider-state.php">granted an <em>en banc</em> rehearing</a> [JURIST reports]. The original Ninth Circuit panel ruled that the state secrets privilege can only be invoked in relation to established evidence in the case, not just at the possibility that such evidence may be uncovered should the case proceed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation would block <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and the other accused 9/11 conspirators from being tried in a US civilian court. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced last year that Mohammed would <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">face a civilian trial</a>, drawing intense criticism and leading the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/holder-confirms-no-final-decision-on-trial-venue-for-accused-911-conspirators.php">reconsider the decision</a> [JURIST reports]. The bill must still be approved by the Senate. Holder sent a <a href="/paperchase/AG%20CR%20Letter%2012-9-10.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] Thursday to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urging them not to include the provision in the spending bill. If passed, the ban would remain in place until September 30, the end of the current fiscal year.

<p>In the first civilian trial of an ex-Guantanamo detainee, a federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ex-guantanamo-detainee-acquitted-on-all-but-one-charge.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ahmed_khalfan_ghailani.htm">Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani</a> [GlobalSecurity profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ghailani">news archive</a>] last month on only one of 285 counts of conspiracy, murder and attempted murder for his involvement in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombings of US embassies</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=embassy+kenya+tanzania">news archive</a>] in Tanzania and Kenya. While the Obama administration viewed the conviction and 20-year minimum sentence as a victory, opponents have cited the acquittals as evidence that civilian courts are inadequate venues for trying terror suspects. Several scholars have nevertheless maintained that federal courts are <a href="/forum/2010/11/ghailani-verdict-a-victory-for-american-justice.php">capable of serving justice</a> [JURIST op-ed; JURIST <a href="/forum/2010/11/the-ghailani-trial-justice-served.php">op-ed</a>]. Upon taking office, President Barack Obama pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report] by January 2010, but he has been met with strong opposition to transferring detainees to US soil<br />

The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act, would amend the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ208.104.pdf">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996</a> [text, PDF] to allow certain children of illegal immigrants an opportunity to achieve legal residency. The bill was previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/bill-giving-children-of-illegal.php">defeated in Congress in 2007</a>, but <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/senators-introduce-immigration-reform-bill.php">reintroduced</a> [JURIST reports] in October by US Senators <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/biography/">Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) and <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profiles] as part of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d111:1:./temp/~bdSUpF::|/home/LegislativeData.php|">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2010</a> [legislative materials], which includes several bills that, if passed, would greatly change US <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] law. Rights groups like the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website] have praised the vote, highlighting the need to keep young people in the country to advance ingenuity in high education and service in the military. Thomas Saenz, President and General Counsel for MALDEF, further said that the bill "vindicates longstanding national, constitutional values to embrace newcomers and to reject cross-generational punishment." The Senate was originally scheduled to vote on the bill Thursday, but the vote was canceled, which likely pushed the Senate's consideration of the bill into early next year.

<p>Illegal immigration continues to be a concern for local governments, as the federal government has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Earlier this week, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-mulls-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether an Arizona statute imposing sanctions on employers that hire illegal immigrants is preempted by federal law. Last month, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit heard arguments on another controversial Arizona immigration law, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1070 </a> [materials, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Also in November, the Nebraska Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nebraska-high-court-declines-to-rule-on-local-immigration-ordinance.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] on a local ordinance banning the hiring, harboring or renting of property to illegal immigrants. In September, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that two ordinances passed by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, making it more difficult for illegal immigrants to live or work in the town, are unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The settlements include $3.4 billion to resolve claims that the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] <a href="http://www.doi.gov/archive/indiantrust.html">mismanaged funds</a> [DOI materials] held in trust for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Indian+Trust+Settlement">American Indian landowners</a> [JURIST news archive] and $1.2 billion for African American farmers claiming they suffered racial discrimination in US <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] loan programs. Obama said, "[w]hile I am pleased that this Act reflects important progress, much work remains to be done to address other claims of past discrimination made by women and Hispanic farmers against the Department of Agriculture as well as to address needs of tribal communities." The <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-house-of-representatives-approves-minority-farmer-settlements.php">House of Representatives approved the settlement</a> last week after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/senate-approves-minority-farmer-settlements.php">approved by the September</a> [JURIST reports] in November.

<p>The settlements arose from two cases. <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/index.php">Eloise Cobell</a> [plaintiff website] originally filed litigation in 1996 related to DOI's alleged mismanagement of the Indian Trust, which was established by Congress in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases to Indian lands. Although it was determined that the US government had not engaged in fraud, it was held that DOI unreasonably delayed accounting of the trust. A <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">settlement was reached</a> [JURIST report] last December. In 1999, black farmers alleged in <a href="http://www.bfaa-us.org/pigford-v-glickman.html">Pigford v. Glickman</a> [BFAA backgrounder] that they were being denied USDA farm loans or forced to wait longer for loan approval than were non-minority farmers. The USDA and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/usda-reaches-125-billion-settlement-in.php">$1.2 billion settlement</a> [JURIST report] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group also stressed that it supports many of the health insurance coverage provisions in the new law and only opposes parts of the law they believe <a href="http://www.njphysicians.com/tabid/62/Default.aspx?udt_379_param_detail=61">hurt the health care industry</a> [press release], such as reimbursement methods. However, Judge Susan Wigenton ruled that the law does not cause the alleged harms and does not violate the Constitution. The New Jersey Physicians group intends to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-08/nj-judge-throws-out-suit-challenging-health-law.html">appeal the case</a> [Bloomberg report] to the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>The recently enacted health care reform law has faced numerous lawsuits over the last few months. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a health care lawsuit filed by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website]. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a group of attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the health care law. The <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and joined by <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">20 states</a> [JURIST reports] and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. A week earlier, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was filed by the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, <a href="http://www.bamn.com/">By Any Means Necessary</a> (BAMN) [advocacy website], a group that supports full integration and equality of minorities and marginalized groups into American society. BAMN and other Proposition 209 opponents argued that the ban violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. Plaintiffs had <a href="/paperchase/FINAL%20BRIEF%20OPP%20TO%20DISMISSAL.pdf">cited</a> [brief, PDF] the 2003 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] case <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZS.html">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> [opinion text], which upheld affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law School. In Wednesday's ruling, the judge declined to follow in Michigan's footsteps, noting that the Supreme Court only suggested using race as preference and did not require it, so California may use whatever method it desires. Plaintiffs plan to appeal.

<p>Proposition 209 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-high-court-rules-affirmative-action-ban-constitutional.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] in August. In addition to California, five states have adopted affirmative actions bans. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-amendment-banning-affirmative-action.php">Arizona voters</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/AZ/22333/40707/en/summary.html">approved</a> [results] Proposition 107, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/1r/proposed/h.hcr2019-se-montenegro.pdf">amending the state constitution</a> [HCR 2019 text] to ban affirmative action programs in state government agencies. In November 2008, ballot measures banning affirmative action <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ballot-measure-fails.php">failed in Colorado</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/affirmative-action-ballot-measure-fails.php">passed in Nebraska</a> [JURIST reports].

If the suit had been successful, the Democratic Party would have been dissolved and party leaders, including current <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/en">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website], would have been banned from participating in politics for five years.

According to the report, Virginia Tech officials failed to comply with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/usc_sec_20_00001092----000-.html">Clery Act</a> [20 USC &#167; 1092(f) text], which requires universities to disclose crime statistics and communication information about campus safety. The report found:<blockquote>Virgina Tech failed to comply with the requirements relating to a timely warning ... in response to the shootings on campus on April 16, 2007. There are two aspects to this violation. First, the warnings that were issued by the University were not prepared or disseminated in a manner to give clear and timely notice of the threat to the health and safety of campus community members. Second, Virginia Tech did not follow its own policy for the issuance of timely warnings as published in its annual campus security reports.</blockquote>Education Secretary Arne Duncan <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-us-department-education-arne-duncan-virginia-tech">noted</a> [press release], "[w]hile Virginia Tech failed to adequately warn students that day, we recognize that the University has put far-reaching changes in place since that time to help improve campus safety and better protect its students and community."

<p>Virginia Tech has faced several lawsuits over the shooting incident. Last month, a Virginia circuit court judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/judge-denies-immunity-claim-in-virginia-tech-wrongful-death-lawsuit.php">ruled</a> that a lawsuit by two families whose children were killed in shooting can proceed against school administrators, despite their claims of sovereign immunity. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/families-of-virginia-tech-shooting.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], seeking $10 million in damages, accuses the administrators of gross negligence for failing to warn students of the shootings immediately after the first shooting at 7:15 AM. It is being brought by two families who opted out of an <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/judge-approves-11-million-virginia-tech.php">$11 million dollar settlement</a> [JURIST report] to which 24 of the 32 victims' families agreed in June 2008. The settlement gave each family $100,000 plus medical expenses and provided for meetings with Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech administration and police officials. Many of the families had considered wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits against the state of Virginia after an independent state panel reported that different school policies could have avoided some of the deaths, but the settlement terms required the families to release their claims. In December 2007, Congress <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/congress-passes-bill-closing-gun.php">passed by voice vote</a> an act that closes a <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/virgina-tech-gunman-prohibited-by.php">loophole</a> [JURIST report] that allowed Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho to purchase firearms despite a court order mandating psychiatric treatment. The Virginia Tech shootings left 33 people dead and 25 wounded in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/vatechshootings/?sid=ST2008061701801">deadliest shooting incident in US history</a> [WP backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Senate <a href="http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00270">fell three votes short</a> [roll call vote] of the 60 votes necessary to approve a cloture motion on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN3454:">defense spending bill</a> [S 3454 materials] that would include a provision for repeal. After the vote, Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) and <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/">Susan Collins</a> (R-ME) [official websites] said they <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/public/continue.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=cd687e4f-b8e8-907f-53d6-d408697dc11c&CFID=60174682&CFTOKEN=37944742">plan to introduce a separate piece of legislation</a> [press release] to repeal the ban, but it appears unlikely that such a bill could pass before the end of the current legislative session. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] expressed disappointment with the vote and called on Congress to continue to work toward repealing the ban. The Senate previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] to invoke cloture to repeal DADT in September.

<p>The Obama administration has been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Last week, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-committee-hears-military-chiefs-dont-ask-dont-tell-testimony.php">heard conflicting testimony</a> [JURIST report] from top military leaders on the services' readiness to repeal DADT. The hearing was held to review a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130%28secure-hires%29.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/dod-concludes-little-negative-impact-to-repealing-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>], released earlier that week, which concluded that repealing DADT would only minimally effect military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. Last month, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in November, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. Gates issued a memorandum in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior DOD officials. The policy was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">struck down</a> by a federal court in September, but an appeals court has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stayed that ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is said that France's <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French] ordered the Paris court to <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20101209-jacques-chirac-face-single-trial-corruption-charges-march-paris-france">consolidate the two cases</a> [Fance 24 report] into one trial. Chirac is accused of financing the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], while mayor of Paris by illegally establishing fake city positions for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars. In the other case, he is charged with illegal conflict of interest concerning jobs for people in his conservative party. Chirac has denied any foul play. His trial is set to begin March 7, and, if convicted, Chirac faces up to 10 years in prison and fines that could exceed USD $200,000.

<p>In September, the Paris city council voted to accept a deal in which Chirac will pay the city USD $741,000 in compensation for money he allegedly paid to supporters for whom he created false jobs. In exchange for the compensation, the city <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">agreed to drop out of a corruption suit</a> [JURIST report] against Chirac. Chirac said the payment was not an admission of guilt. Last December, a French judge placed Chirac under <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report]. Chirac was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-judge-orders-chirac-to-stand.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on related charges of embezzlement and misuse of public funds last October. The charges were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/france-judge-opens-formal-probe-into.php">originally filed in 2007</a> [JURIST report] after Chirac's presidency ended and he no longer had judicial immunity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court said that Tanzi and the 14 former executives sentenced with him will have to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gCcqmCSJgY8wScWg4XTc9pD1Oleg?docId=CNG.5d466a6578566e3032488678e79f321f.121">reimburse the company</a> [AFP report], two billion euros. The executives must also compensate 30,000 defrauded investors around 30 million euros. Tanzi is expected to appeal the verdict, and the defense has blamed the banks that sold Parmalat bonds even when they knew that the group was insolvent. A trail examining the responsibility of <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup</a>, <a href="http://www.db.com/index_e.htm">Deutsche Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a> and  <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate websites] is currently underway in Milan.

<p>Last July, BOA announced that it reached a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/parmalat-and-bank-of-america-reach-100.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Parmalat in litigation stemming from its 2003 collapse. Under the terms of the settlement, BOA will pay Pamalat USD $100 million, which includes both cash and non-cash components. The settlement resolves a <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/federal-judge-allows-parmalat-suit.php">$10 million lawsuit</a> filed by Parmalat against BOA in 2004 and a <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/judge-allows-bank-of-america-to-pursue.php">counterclaim</a> [JURIST reports] filed by BOA, alleging the company engaged in fraud and is maliciously suing the bank to shift blame. The two companies filed a <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/BofAParmalatstay.pdf">joint motion to stay proceedings</a> [text, PDF], and further details of the settlement will become available once it has been filed in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. In December 2008, an Italian court in Milan in a separate case concerning stock market manipulation <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/parmalat-founder-sentenced-to-10-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Tanzi to 10 years in prison for his role in the company's collapse. Tanzi was the first executive to be sentenced in connection with the 14 billion euro fraud scheme in 2003 that bankrupted the company. He was convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy and criminal association for allegedly concealing the company's debt. Tanzi was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/italy-judge-indicts-parmalat-founder.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] along with approximately 20 other executives in July 2007. Parmalat filed for insolvency in December 2003 after discovering accounting discrepancies totaling nearly $5 billion in debt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor accused al-Bashir of ordering attacks on civilians and protecting those following his orders. Al-Bashir has been charged with <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">genocide</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST reports], but has thus far avoided arrest.

<p>Several African countries that are state parties to the ICC's <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [materials] have come under fire for allowing al-Bashir to attend events in their countries without arrest. Last week, the ICC asked the Central African Republic to take steps to arrest al-Bashir and transfer him to the court if he should enter the country for its independence celebrations. In August, Kenya welcomed al-Bashir to a celebration for the country's adoption of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report].

The comments come following efforts from the US government and US-based companies to cut ties with the controversial website, responsible for leaking more than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/world/statessecrets.html">250,000 classified diplomatic documents</a> [NYT backgrounder] last month and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/wikileaks-founder-alleges-documents-may-reveal-us-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.php">90,000 related to the Afghan war</a> [JURIST report] in July. After releasing the documents last month, Mastercard, Visa, Amazon.com, PayPal and EveryDNS have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jpOREfixxYu9SSlaOj-Xc6TsNLJA?docId=0520373987214ceebc93acfa7bab8e1f">ended involvement with WikiLeaks</a> [AP report], jeopardizing its ability to raise funds and continue operations. In turn, these companies have been subject to retaliatory cyber attacks, in which WikiLeaks has denied involvement. Pillay, who described the exchange as a cyber war, went on to call for an end to these attacks and actions by governments against WikiLeaks taken through third party companies, instead <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6B81WE20101209">calling for out right prosecution</a> [Reuters report] if illegal acts have been committed. Also Thursday, US Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) and <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/public/continue.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home&IsTextOnly=false&IsSkipSplash=true">Susan Collins</a> (R-ME) [official websites] <a href="http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Press.MajorityNews&ContentRecord_id=cc9076c7-5056-8059-760a-440a2b3ee277">praised the actions of these corporations</a> [press release], describing them as "good corporate citizens."<blockquote>Companies that are cutting off their services to Wikileaks ... are doing the right thing as good corporate citizens and deserve the support of the American people. The Wikileaks data dump has jeopardized U.S. national interests and the lives of intelligence sources around the world. This is no time for business as usual. While corporate entities make decisions based on their obligations to their shareholders, sometimes full consideration of those obligations requires them to act as responsible citizens. We offer our admiration and support to those companies exhibiting courage and patriotism as they face down intimidation from hackers sympathetic to Wikileaks' philosophy of irresponsible information dumps for the sake of damaging global relationships.</blockquote>On Tuesday, US <a href="http://peteking.house.gov/">Representative Pete King</a> (R-NY) [official website] introduced the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/gpoxmlc111/h6506_ih.xml">Securing Human Intelligence and Enforcing Lawful Dissemination Act</a> (SHIELD) [HR 6506 text], which would allow the prosecution of the disclosure of classified information related to intelligence activities. Lieberman introduced similar legislation in the Senate last week.

<p>Shortly after WikiLeaks' release of the classified documents, US Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters that the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Defense (DOD) were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/doj-announces-wikileaks-criminal-investigation.php">conducting a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] of WikiLeaks for the release. Holder condemned WikiLeaks' recent release of government cables, saying that it threatens US national security, specifically by risking the safety of those serving the country and straining important diplomatic relationships. Holder said during a press conference, that "there is an active ongoing criminal investigation that [the DOJ] is conducting with the Department of Defense." He added, "there is a basis to believe crimes have been committed, and we are in the process of investigating those crimes." The day before, the Obama administration issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/28/statement-press-secretary">statement</a> [press release] through Press Secretary Robert Gibbs condemning the releases as "reckless and dangerous." Holder did not say when he expected to announce the investigation's results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It would normally be presented to either the recipient or a close relative, as has been the case with other laureates who were being held in detention at the time, such as Myanmar's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archive], who was the winner in 1991. Liu is currently serving an <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">11-year prison term</a> [JURIST report], and Chinese authorities did not allow Liu's family to attend the ceremony. Presenting the award, Nobel committee chairman Torbjorn Jagland <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/presentation-speech.html">explained</a> [statement] that Liu was chosen because of his "long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China." Jagland continued:<blockquote>There are many dissidents in China, and their opinions differ on many points. The severe punishment imposed on Liu made him more than a central spokesman for human rights. Practically overnight, he became the very symbol, both in China and internationally, of the struggle for such rights in China. ... China's own constitution upholds fundamental human rights. Article 35 of the country's constitution thus lays down that "Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration." Article 41 begins by stating that citizens "have the right to criticise and make suggestions regarding any state organ or functionary." Liu has exercised his civil rights. He has done nothing wrong. He must therefore be released.</blockquote>Also on Friday, <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english2010/">Xinhua</a> [media website], the official press agency of China, published articles criticizing the award and the Nobel committee, one of which <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-12/10/c_13643635.htm">leveled the criticism</a> [Xinhua report] that "the 2009 and 2010 peace prize winners reflect the partisanship of the Nobel Committee&#8212;it cheers politicians from the West and opposes leaders from the East. It praises the United States and blames China." and "does not consider the difference in situations in different countries and different parts of the world" when choosing award recipients. Another commentator cited Liu's <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-12/11/c_13644361.htm">status as a "convicted criminal"</a> [Xinhua report], and the bias of the Nobel committee as reasons to disregard the award.

<p>The Nobel committee announced Xiaobo as the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize</a> [JURIST report] in October. Liu has been one of China's most prominent dissidents. He spent two years in prison following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] uprising, has long challenged China's one-party rule and co-authored <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=89851&item_id=85717">Charter 08</a> [text], a petition calling for political reforms in the country. He is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence in China for inciting subversion. US President Barack Obama, the 2009 award recipient, praised the Nobel Committee's decision and called on China to release Liu. Chinese <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Chinese] spokesperson Jiang Yu <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.cn/chn/gxh/tyb/fyrbt/t759532.htm">denounced the decision</a> [press release, in Chinese], calling it "contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Prize." Chinese authorities have censored the announcement, blocking internet searches and international broadcasts about it and even turning off phones of people who text messaged the news.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdna.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] ruled Thursday that prosecutors can indict a genetic profile in a rape case, even if they do not know the suspect's name. The ruling will allow prosecutors to indict suspects based on a DNA profile so that once the suspect is identified the prosecution will not be barred by the statute of limitations. The ruling came in the case of Jerry Dixon, whose DNA profile was indicted in 2006 to toll the 15-year statute of limitations on rapes that had occurred in 1991. Dixon was identified in 2007 after being required to submit a DNA sample when he was convicted on separate motor vehicle charges. His lawyer argued that allowing prosecutors to indict a genetic profile provides no notice to the person being charged. The court rejected that argument, finding:<blockquote>We have not previously held that the constitutional requirement of notice inside the statute of limitations period must be given at any particular point following the return of an indictment. ... Indeed, our long-standing rules of criminal procedure counsel otherwise, and we have never perceived any conflict with art. 12. ... Moreover, while we have concluded that generic John Doe indictments are not permitted by art. 12, the Legislature has expressly vested in the Commonwealth the authority to indict by "a fictitious name or by any other practicable description." ... Such authority, we have said, "is salutary, to the end that, in so far as art. 12 of the [Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] permits, one who ought to be indicted is prevented from hampering the grand jury in the performance of their duty by screening his name and other identifying characteristics." ... The Commonwealth routinely perfects its constitutionally required notice to the defendant, as required by art. 12, after the issuance date of indictment. It logically follows that where the Commonwealth secures an otherwise valid and timely indictment, but inserts the defendant's proper name in the record outside the relevant limitation period, there is no constitutional or statutory infirmity.</blockquote>Dixon is currently awaiting trial on the rape charges. 

<p>In January, the Supreme Court of California also <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-authorizes-dna.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the use of "John Doe" arrest warrants based on DNA profiles. In May, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-court-upholds-pre-trial-dna.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of mandatory DNA collection for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority. Judge Gregory Hollows of the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] found that although the collection of DNA from those arrested on federal felony, sexual abuse, or violent crime charges does constitute a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, a person arrested based on probable cause "has a diminished expectation of privacy in his own identity." Federal agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-expanding-dna-data-collection-to-all.php">began collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, although they had been authorized to do so since 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mensing</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/09-993_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1039.htm">Actavis v.

Demahy</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Pet.09-1501.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] were consolidated and will receive one hour of oral argument time. In each of the three cases, the drug manufacturers sought review after appellate courts ruled that the plaintiffs' cases could move forward and that federal law did not preempt their state law claims. Both plaintiffs suffered a neurologic side effect, <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000685.htm">tardive dyskinesia</a> [NIH backgrounder], from their use of the generic drug metoclopramide to treat gastric reflux.

<p>These consolidated cases will answer a question that the Supreme Court left open when it <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-rules-state-law-not.php">decided Wyeth v. Levine</a> [JURIST report] in 2009&#8212;namely, is state law preempted in drug labeling cases when the drug is a generic, rather than name-brand medication. In the <span class="casename">Wyeth</span> decision, the court held that manufacturers of name-brand medicines bear primary responsibility for product labeling, and that the silence of the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact1.htm">Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a> [text] on the issue of preemption was sufficient proof that Congress did not contemplate preemption in medication labeling. The court stated that manufacturers may themselves initiate strengthened warning labels to comply with state and federal requirements. The court's decision in <span class="casename">Wyeth</span> upheld a Vermont Supreme Court's affirmance of a $6.7 million jury award for the plaintiff.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was then handed over to the CIA and transported to a secret detention facility in Afghanistan where he was held for four months in allegedly inhumane conditions, interrogated and abused. The German government decided against pursuing El-Masri's claims in 2007 after officials in Washington, DC, stated they would reject any attempts at extradition due to national security issues.

<p>In October, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/europe-rights-court-to-review-macedonia-role-in-cia-extraordinary-rendition.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/national-security/news/el-masri-european-court-20101014">review the involvement</a> [press release] of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in the extraordinary rendition and torture of El-Masri by the CIA. The case against the FYROM is the first in which a government has been called before an international tribunal to explain its involvement in the CIA's extraordinary rendition program. In May, a lawyer from the Spanish National Court Office of the Prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-prosecutor-requests-arrest-warrants-for-cia-rendition-agents.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] judge Ismael Moreno to issue arrest warrants for the 13 CIA agents who allegedly kidnapped El-Masri. The Office of the Prosecutor alleged that the court had jurisdiction to issue the warrants because the agents made a stop in Spanish territory using hidden identities without official Spanish government authorization to do so. In 2008, El-Masri <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/el-masri-petition-iachr">petitioned</a> [ACLU materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/el-masri-asks-oas-rights-court-to.php">report</a>] the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] to open an investigation of human rights violations by the US, alleging that he was tortured by the CIA. In 2007, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/supreme-court-rejects-el-masri.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] without comment El-Masri's petition for <em>certiorari</em>, ostensibly supporting the Bush administration's contention that allowing El-Masri's federal lawsuit to proceed would require the revelation of state secrets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The arrest of former interior ministry official Tomislav Mercep comes just one day after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&lang=e">press release</a>] criticizing Croatia's lack of political will, adequate laws and court system necessary to prosecute alleged war crimes. The report, "Behind a Wall of Silence: Prosecution of War Crimes in Croatia" called on the Croatian government to increase the rate at which war crimes trials are adjudicated in order to provide justice for victims and their families. The report also called for the prosecution of several top-level Croatian officials, including Mercep who has been accused over the past 15 years of ordering military units to kill and torture Serbian citizens during the Serbo-Croatian conflict. The previous allegations had never been fully investigated by any Croatian authority despite what AI called "publicly available evidence" against him. Nicola Duckworth, Europe and Central Asia Programme Director at AI, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012102001&lang=e">praised the arrest</a> [press release] calling it a "welcome development." 

<p>Also on Friday, former Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Austria pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by Croatia. Sanader, who was elected to parliament after he stepped down from the prime minister position in 2009, stands accused of corruption, abuse of power and fraud for taking nearly <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">&#8364;4 million from public firms and state institutions</a> [<em>Croatian Times</em> report]. Croatian officials have been under serious pressure to the tackle the issue of corruption in order to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/croatia/index_en.htm">gain accession</a> [EU materials] to the EU by 2012. The prosecution of individuals for organized crime and war crimes has been one of the major issues faced by Croatia in its accession process. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [JURIST news archive] investigating war crimes in the area.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mladic is one of two high-level targets still at large under the jurisdiction of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for allegedly overseeing the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> and other war crimes violations during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. The men were charged with helping Mladic by renting apartments in Belgrade for him in 2002. Judge Dragan Garic held that some of the charges were <a href="http://www.novinepress.co.rs/sr/vesti/vesti_dana/story/143617/Oslobo%C4%91eni++%22jataci%22+Ratka+Mladi%C4%87a.html">barred by the statute of limitations</a> [Press Online report, in Croatian], which had expired in 2008 and 2009. For the remaining charges, Garic held that there was not enough evidence to  warrant a conviction. Prosecutors have <a href="http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/135/Hronika/808408/Jataci+oslobo%C4%91eni+krivice.html">announced that they will appeal</a> [PTC report, in Croatian] the ruling to the <a href="http://www.bg.ap.sud.rs/">Court of Appeal in Belgrade</a> [official website, in Serbian]. 

<p>In September, ICTY prosecutor <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icty-prosecutor-urges-greater-effort-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">called on Serbia and other governments</a> [JURIST report] to increase efforts to find and arrest Mladic. Brammertz said failure to arrest Mladic would send war criminals the message that if they avoid capture long enough, the world will cease to care about bringing them to justice. Brammertz also emphasized the importance of seeking justice for Mladic's victims. Authorities must work quickly to arrest Mladic, Brammertz noted, since the ICTY is scheduled to be shut down in three years. In May, Mladic's family filed a claim in the Belgrade District Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php">seeking to have him declared officially dead</a> [JURIST report] in order to collect his state pension and sell his property. Earlier that month, the ICTY announced that the Office of the Prosecutor filed a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-amend-mladic-indictment.php">amend the indictment against Mladic</a> [JURIST report] to include 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in order to help speed up court proceedings once Mladic is captured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge, filed with the Sudanese Constitutional Court, alleges that the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6BB03F20101212?sp=true">commission violated the procedures</a> [Reuters report] for the referendum, set out in the <a href="http://saycsd.org/doc/SouthernSudanReferendumActFeb10EnglishVersion.pdf">2009 Southern Sudan Referendum Act</a> [text, PDF] and the Sudanese <a href="http://www.sudan-embassy.de/c_Sudan.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF], in conducting voter registration and in failing to hold to the timetable set out for the vote. The Society Organization Network also accused the commission of placing members of the <a href="http://www.splmtoday.com/">Sudan People's Liberation Movement</a> (SPLM) [party website], a pro-secession party, in senior posts and preventing voters in the north from registering to vote. Members of the SPLM <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-12/12/c_13646200.htm">described the lawsuit as sabotage</a> [Xinhua report] by the National Congress Party (NCP), the dominant political party of the north. In September, a human rights expert told the UN that Sudan is <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-expert-tells-un-sudan-unprepared-for-january-self-determination-referendum.php">not prepared for the referendum</a> [JURIST report]. Mohamed Chande Othman, a Tanzanian judge and independent expert on the Sudan human rights situation, presented a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/15session/A.HRC.15.CRP.1_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] warning that Sudan does not have the necessary infrastructure in place for the January referendum. The report cites major setbacks, including the suppression of free speech and of the press, restrictions on other civil and political rights, and inadequate protection of society due to a lack of well-trained police officers, prosecutors and judges. 

<p>The referendum is meant to be the culmination of the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8306.doc.htm">2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) [UN press release] that ended two decades of civil war. Also in September, the UN Security Council issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc10031.doc.htm">statement</a> [text] calling on the CPA parties to take "urgent action to facilitate peaceful and on-time referenda that reflect the will of the Sudanese people, to respect their results, and to resolve key remaining post-referenda issues." In April, Sudan attempted to have its first democratic multi-party election in almost a quarter of a century, but it was fraught with controversy. Two political parties in eastern Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sudan-opposition-parties-accuse-ruling.php">accused the ruling NCP</a> [JURIST report] of using voter fraud and intimidation in gaining electoral victories in their region of the country during the national elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court decided 2-1 to withdraw its August <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], which found <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&group=00001-01000&file=350-363">California Civil Procedure Code &#167; 354.4</a> [text] unconstitutional because it interfered with foreign relations by recognizing the World War I-era killings of more than one million Armenians by Turkish soldiers as a genocide. The court rejected arguments that the US has an official policy of not recognizing the killings as a genocide. The court pointed to Congress recognizing a day of remembrance for the incident and statements by the executive branch that have described the incident as genocide. The lawsuit was brought by a California citizen of Armenian descent who initiated a class action suit against insurance companies, alleging they had failed to pay benefits. Most <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2010%2F12%2F11%2FBA0E1GP6HA.DTL">historians recognize</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] the incident as a genocide, but Turkey has urged the US not to do so.

<p>The Armenian genocide remains a contentious issue in US law and politics. In August, a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmalaysia.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Anwar+Ibrahim">news archive</a>] on Monday filed a complaint in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. The leaked US diplomatic cable claimed Australia's <a href="http://www.ona.gov.au/">Office of National Assessments</a> [official website] had concluded, in agreement with Singapore's Intelligence Agency, that the sodomy charges against Ibrahim were the result of a set-up, but that he was in fact <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/12/13/nation/7611687&sec=nation">guilty of committing the acts</a> [<em>Malaysian Star</em> report] for which he has been indicted. Anwar is charged with sodomizing his former aide Mohamad Saiful Bukhari Azlan in 2008, and the trial is currently ongoing. His lawyers have called for the Malaysian media sources that have published the claims to be charged with contempt and say the reports are based on hearsay and cannot be trusted. Anwar has continued to describe the charges as a farce aimed at preventing him from taking his seat in parliament following the gains made by his party in the 2008 elections.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected a defamation suit</a> [JURIST report] filed by Anwar against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile]. Anwar filed suit in 2006 after Mahathir allegedly suggested at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. In September, the <a href="http://portal.kehakiman.gov.my/">Malaysian Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/malaysia-appeals-court-rejects-opposition-leaders-bid-to-dismiss-sodomy-charge.php">dismissed</a> Anwar's appeal of the Kuala Lumpur High Court's <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/malaysia-appeals-court-rejects-opposition-leaders-bid-to-dismiss-sodomy-charge.php">refusal to throw out the sodomy charges</a> [JURIST reports] against him based on allegations that his accuser had an affair with the prosecutor. A three-man panel ruled that, under Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/legislation/Court_Of_The_Judicature_Act.shtml#s3">Court of Judicature Act</a> (CJA) [materials, text], the appeals court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the High Court's ruling was not a final decision. Counsel for Anwar was to appeal to Malaysia's highest court, which will further <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/malaysia-court-adjourns-opposition-leaders-trial-after-alleged-prosecutorial-misconduct.php">delay his trial</a> [JURIST report]. This was his second attempt to have the sodomy charge against him <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/malaysia-appeals-court-refuses-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/intervallicensingcomplaint0827.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], which also named <a href="http://www.corp.aol.com/">AOL</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://ir.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/specialLinks.do?file=/companyinfo/companyfacts/index.jsp&amp;template=companyinfo">Office Depot</a>, <a href="http://about.officemax.com/html/officemax_who_we_are.shtml">OfficeMax</a>, <a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/about_us/index.html">Staples</a>, <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/center/us/yahoo/">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/about">YouTube</a> [corporate websites], the companies misappropriated technologies patented by Allen's now defunct Interval Research Corporation and currently held by Interval Licensing, LLC. The suit charged that the 11 defendants infringed on a patent that <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F6757682">recommends like content to users based on real-time viewing data</a>, while all but Facebook violated another that <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F6263507">amalgamates and analyzes audio, video and text data</a> [USPTO materials] to perform a similar function. It further alleged that AOL, Apple, Google and Yahoo violated two additional patents, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F6034652">6,034,652</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PALL&amp;RefSrch=yes&amp;Query=PN%2F6788314">6,788,314</a> [USPTO materials], that identify advertisements, news and videos to display "in a way that occupies [a user's] peripheral attention." Judge Marsha Pechman dismissed Allen's claims, finding that "Plaintiff has failed to identify the infringing products or devices with any specificity." A spokesperson said Allen <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCATRE6BC0NZ20101213">plans to file an amended complaint</a> [Reuters report]

<p>Allen's suit comes as several of the named defendants face unrelated litigation alleging misappropriation of intellectual property. Connecticut company XPRT Ventures LLC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ebay-sued-for-38-billion-in-patent-infringement-case.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] eBay in July claiming the infringement of six patents for online auctions and payment systems. In April, a federal appeals court found that eBay is <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-ebay-has-no.php">not required to actively monitor its website</a> [JURIST report] for the sale of counterfeit goods. The ruling came shortly after a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-rules-ebay-intentionally.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the company to pay <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [official website] damages for paying search engines to direct consumers to counterfeit LVMH products. LVMH previously secured a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">$63 million judgment</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods that infringed on registered designs. Patent holding company NTP <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ntp-sues-apple-for-alleged-patent-infringement.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in July against Apple and Google, among other smart phone makers, related to the use of e-mail systems utilizing technology patented by NTP. The US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-trade-commission-to-probe-apple-for-htc-patent-infringement.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] in June into allegations by <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=0">HTC Corp</a> [corporate website] accusing Apple of patent infringement on certain portable electronic devices. In October 2009, Finnish telecommunications company <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Apple alleging that the company infringed 10 of its patents since the first iPhone was released in 2007. The patents cover wireless data transmission, speech coding and security/encryption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/BUSINESS/12/12/madoff.lawsuit.mount.ft/index.html">influx of litigation</a> [FT report] coincided with the Saturday deadline for seeking compensation. Picard has spent two years investigating, and the various resulting lawsuits have culminated in more than 1,100 subpoenas. The suits implicate institutions such as <a href="http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/">HSBC</a>, <a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan">JPMorgan</a>, <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> and <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup</a> [corporate websites], either for enabling the Ponzi scheme or their failure to recognize it. <a href="http://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/home.htm">UniCredit</a> [corporate website] and Sonja Kohn face the largest lawsuits, and are accused of participating in the scheme. Although Picard's deadline has passed, the US attorney in Manhattan Preet Bharara still has three more years to file criminal charges or a civil forfeiture claim. The institutions and individuals sued by Picard continue to deny the allegations.

<p>Last November, former outside accountant for Madoff, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff.html">David Friehling</a> [case materials], <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff/friehlingdavidpleaagreement.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [plea agreement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-madoff-accountant-pleads-guilty.php">report</a>] to fraud charges in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Despite his guilty plea, Friehling did not admit knowledge of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Friehling, who was <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20959.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sec-charges-madoff-accountant-with.php">report</a>] in March, pleaded guilty on nine counts, including securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, making false filings with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] and obstructing or impeding the enforcement of internal revenue laws. Friehling also agreed to forfeit $3,183,000 in addition to other property obtained through his services to Madoff and promised to cooperate in the government's investigation surrounding the Madoff scandal. Also last year, Madoff's former financial chief Frank DiPascali <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/former-madoff-financial-chief-pleads.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] for his role in Madoff's scheme. In June 2009, Madoff was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">150 years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty to 11 charges of fraud</a> in March 2009 after agreeing to a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">partial judgment from the SEC</a> [JURIST reports] for civil charges stemming from his role in defrauding investors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case presented the question of whether the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000109----000-.html">first-sale doctrine</a> [17 USC &#167; 109(a)], which provides that the owner of any particular copy "lawfully made under this title" may resell that good without the authority of the copyright holder, applies to imported goods manufactured abroad.

Judge Henry Hudson, who had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], found that an individual's decision to purchase health insurance is beyond the reach of Congress and outside the purview of the Commerce, Necessary and Proper, General Welfare and Taxation powers enumerated in the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text]:<blockquote>A thorough survey of pertinent constitutional case law has yielded no reported decisions from any federal appellate courts extending the Commerce Clause or General Welfare Clause to encompass regulation of a person's decision not to purchase a product, notwithstanding its effect on interstate commerce or role in a global regulatory scheme. The unchecked expansion of congressional power to the limits suggested by the Minimum Essential Coverage Provision would invite unbridled exercise of federal police powers. At its core, this dispute is not simply about regulating the business of insurance&#8212;or crafting a scheme of universal health insurance coverage&#8212;it's about an individual's right to choose to participate.</blockquote>Hudson left the rest of the law intact, determining that the minimum coverage provision is severable. Hudson also refused to issue injunctive relief, stating that "the award of declaratory judgment is sufficient to stay the hand of the executive branch pending an appeal." It is anticipated that this challenge will go all the way to the Supreme Court.

<p>Monday's ruling marks the first time a court has struck down part of the health care despite numerous legal challenges. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">granted a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/casedocumentsnewjerseyphysiciansincetalvobamaetal">lawsuit</a> [case materials] brought by a physician organization challenging the law. Earlier in December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a health care challenge filed by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website]. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-allows-florida-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a group of attorneys general challenging the constitutionality of the health care law. The <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and joined by <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">20 states</a> [JURIST reports] and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states. A week earlier, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-urges-calm-following-ivory-coast-election.php">unrest in the country</a> [JURIST report] since elections were held at the beginning of this month. Alassane Ouattara defeated incumbent Laurent Gbagbo, but Gbagbo has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/12/13/general-ivory-coast_8199247.html">refused to concede victory</a> [AP report] to Ouattrara. According to the EU's statement:<blockquote>The Council has considered how to react to the situation in Cote d'Ivoire. It has decided to adopt without delay targeted restrictive measures against those who are obstructing the process of peace and national reconciliation, and in particular who are jeopardising the proper outcome of the electoral process. Those measures will include a visa ban and an assets freeze. They will particularly target those leading figures who have refused to place themselves under the authority of the democratically elected President, of whom an initial list should be adopted rapidly.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37004&Cr=ivoire&Cr1=">UN certified</a> [UN News Centre report] Ouattrara's victory, but both he and Gbagbo have taken oaths of office. Approximately $340 million in aid from the EU <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gzb5km01MF3y2WMau8mjxyfKoDIw?docId=dbf77ed38ed64a14a4c5c8b0027c859c">could also be withheld</a> [AP report] if Gbagbo does not concede victory to Ouattrara.

<p>In February, Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the country's parliament and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] with creation of new government and new election format. Gbagbo had accused Beugre Mambe, the head of the independent electoral commission, of fraud by attempting to register more than 400,000 whom Gbagbo considers to be foreigners. Opposition parties such as the <a href="http://www.rdrci.org/actu.asp">Ivory Coast Democratic Party</a> (PDCI) [party website, in French] and <a href="http://pdcirda.org/">Republican Gathering Party</a> (RDR) [party website, in French] said that most of those voters are ethnic groups in the north of the country, who would likely have voted against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office through delaying six successive elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy:<blockquote>As Myanmar attempts to move forward in its democratic transition and the new Government seeks to establish a new era of peace and prosperity for the people, it is critical that prisoners of conscience be released immediately and unconditionally. These are individuals who were imprisoned for exercising their basic human rights, the freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.</blockquote> The prisoners, most of whom were arrested for peaceful activism, should be released until the government revises national laws to align with international law, Quintana said. Prior to the national elections on November 7, the Myanmar government indicated that it would <a href="http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Myan%20A65%20368.pdf">consider releasing</a> [UN report, PDF] some of the prisoners of conscience, but no prisoners have been released at this time.

<p>Last month, Myanmar's government released pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>], ending her almost eight years under house arrest. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] hailed her release and encouraged the country to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4924">release all political prisoners</a> [press release]. Suu Kyi's release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest. Though the challenge was originally scheduled to be heard in October, the court waited until after the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-elections-denounced-as-unfair-restrictive-of-citizens-rights.php">controversial elections</a> [JURIST report] to issue its ruling. The elections were the first held in the country in 20 years, and have received heavy international criticism. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] in September <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/political-prisoners-myanmar-must-be-freed-2010-09-23">urged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-group-urges-myanmar-to-free-political-prisoners-before-election.php">report</a>] Myanmar's government to release all political prisoners ahead of the nation's November elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In 2007, the Alaska Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/alaska-high-court-strikes-down-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law requiring parental consent before teens under the age of 17 can have an abortion, violates the teens' constitutional right to privacy. The court suggested, however, that a law simply requiring parental notification without consent would probably be valid. More than 30 states require some type of parental involvement before minors can have an abortion&#8212;either notification or consent. In March, an Illinois <a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.net/">Cook County Circuit Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/illinois-judge-upholds-abortion.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2103&amp;ChapAct=750%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A070/&amp;ChapterID=59&amp;ChapterName=FAMILIES&amp;ActName=Parental%20Notice%20of%20Abortion%20Act%20of%201995.">Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995</a> [text] is constitutional. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint against the officials, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">John Yoo</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jay+bybee">Jay Bybee</a>, who authored <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=torture+memos">memos</a> [JURIST news archive] authorizing so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, was originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-judge-weighing-probe-of-us.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009. The groups urged Judge Eloy Velasco to open the investigation because the US government has failed to do so. The groups <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/leading-rights-groups-urge-spanish-court-open-investigation-bush-lawyers-gtm">claim</a> [press release] that recent cables published by Wikileaks demonstrate that the Obama administration has "acted to undermine the legal process through political means and disregarded the independence of the Spanish judiciary." According to the filing:<blockquote>The United States must not be permitted to continue to stall the course of justice, whether domestically or in Spain. The Geneva Conventions and the Torture Statute both mandate that the authors of violations contained therein be brought to justice and subjected to criminal prosecutions. This Court has issued Letters Rogatory pursuant to Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters to ascertain whether the United States is fulfilling its obligations under those treaties through pending criminal investigations in an effort to ensure that it is exercising its jurisdiction efficiently and appropriately. However, with the passage of 19 months and after three formal requests, we respectfully submit that the United States has been afforded more than ample opportunity to make their views known to the Court. It is evident that no investigations or prosecution will be conducted in the United States into the acts contained in the complaint. Rather, a culture of impunity exists in the United States. Without accountability, not only will the authors of the "torture program" profit from (rather than be punished by) confessing their acts, but the acts will likely be repeated.</blockquote>The other officials named in the complaint are David Addington, former counsel to, and chief of staff for, former vice president Dick Cheney, Douglas Feith, former under secretary of defense for policy, former attorney general Alberto Gonzales and former Defense Department general counsel William Haynes.

<p>In February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-concludes-bush-administration.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] the findings of a <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/OPRFinalReport090729.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] concluding that Bybee and Yoo committed professional misconduct when they wrote the memos. Instead, the DOJ said that they were only guilty of "poor judgment" in writing the memos. An internal ethics investigation by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opr/">Office of Professional Responsibility</a> (OPR) [official website] concluded that Yoo had committed "intentional professional misconduct when he violated his duty to exercise independent legal judgment and render thorough, objective and candid legal advice." The report also found that Bybee had committed professional misconduct when he acted in "reckless disregard" of his duty to exercise independent legal advice. However, David Margolis, an associate deputy attorney general, released a separate <a target="_blank" href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/DAGMargolisMemo100105.pdf">memo</a> [text, PDF] overruling the OPR's report, finding its analysis was flawed because it did not have a clear definition of what constitutes professional misconduct.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was filed by <a href="http://www.sldn.org/">Servicemembers Legal Defense Network</a> (SLDN) [advocacy website] on behalf of Michael Almy, Anthony Loverde and Jason Knight in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. All three received numerous military awards and decorations during their respective service and each would have continued to serve had they not been discharged under DADT. Knight, due to a bureaucratic error made on his discharge papers, was eligible for active duty recall and subsequently deployed to Kuwait, where he served as an openly homosexual man for over a year until he was discharged for a second time under the statute. In a <a href="http://www.sldn.org/news/archives/breaking-highly-decorated-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-fi/">statement</a> [press release] made regarding the suit, SLDN's Executive Director Aubrey Sarvis said:<blockquote>This filing is a shot across the bow as we prepare to pursue and sustain an aggressive far reaching litigation strategy if the Senate fails to act this month to repeal the law. This dispute can be resolved by Congress or by the courts. With this filing we put Congress on notice that a cadre of service members and our national legal team stand ready to litigate strategically around the country. The plaintiffs are three service members who want to serve their country again. They represent some of our best and brightest who were fired because of who they are, despite their decorated records.</blockquote> The military policy is highly controversial and its continued enforcement has been attacked on numerous fronts.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-blocks-vote-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">failed to advance a vote on a bill</a> [JURIST report] to repeal DADT. The Senate <a href="http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00270">fell three votes short</a> [roll call vote] of the 60 votes necessary to approve a cloture motion on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN3454:">defense spending bill</a> [S 3454 materials] that would include a provision for repeal. After the vote, Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) and <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/">Susan Collins</a> (R-ME) [official websites] said they <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/public/continue.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=cd687e4f-b8e8-907f-53d6-d408697dc11c&CFID=60174682&CFTOKEN=37944742">plan to introduce a separate piece of legislation</a> [press release] to repeal the ban, but it appears unlikely that such a bill could pass before the end of the current legislative session. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] expressed disappointment with the vote and called on Congress to continue to work toward repealing the ban. The Senate previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cloture-vote-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-fails-senate.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] to invoke cloture to repeal DADT in September.

Lisa Valentine was arrested in December 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-jails-muslim-woman-for.php">ordered to serve 10 days in jail</a> [JURIST report] for contempt of court after she refused to remove her headscarf upon entering a security checkpoint in an Atlanta courtroom. <a href="http://www.ci.douglasville.ga.us/index.asp?NID=134">Douglasville Municipal Court</a> [official website] Judge Keith Rollins found Valentine in contempt for violating a court policy that prohibits wearing headgear in court. Valentine, who also goes by her Islamic name Miedah, was released from jail later in the day after the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] called on the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=25633&amp;&amp;name=n&amp;&amp;currPage">investigate the incident</a> [press release], although jail officials did not confirm their reason for letting her go. The ACLUGA claims that the defendants, the city of Douglasville and the arresting officers, violated Valetine's First and Fourth Amendment rights, as well as the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/housing/housing_rluipa2.php">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> [text]. According to the complaint, "[a]s a result of Defendants' conduct, Mrs. Valentine suffered, and continues to suffer, extreme humiliation, shame, mental anguish, and emotional distress."

<p>The wearing of religious attire in courtrooms and other public places has been a controversial subject. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ninth-circuit-rules-removing-headscarf.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Muslim woman's religious rights were not violated by police officers when she was forced to remove her headscarf while being detained in a holding cell. In April, a judge for the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-over-order.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against a Michigan judge who ordered a Muslim woman to remove her headscarf in court. The <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/29/Scarf%20Suit.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed by CAIR on behalf of Raneen Albaghdady against Judge William Callahan of the Wayne County Circuit Court.

In finding this violation, the court acknowledged that Warshak enjoyed "a reasonable expectation of privacy" in his e-mails by comparing e-mail to more traditional forms of communication, such as telephone conversations, found to be protected in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0389_0347_ZS.html">United States v. Katz</a> [opinion text]. The court stated:<blockquote>Given the fundamental similarities between email and traditional forms of communication, it would defy common sense to afford emails lesser Fourth Amendment protection. Email is the technological scion of tangible mail, and it plays an indispensable part in the Information Age. Over the last decade, email has become 'so pervasive that some persons may consider [it] to be [an] essential means or necessary instrument[] for self-expression, even self-identification.' It follows that email requires strong protection under the Fourth Amendment; otherwise, the Fourth Amendment would prove an ineffective guardian of private communication, an essential purpose it has long been recognized to serve.</blockquote>The case was ultimately remanded for a recalculation of Warshak's prison sentence, but his conviction and $45 million fine were affirmed.</p>

<p>The application of the Fourth Amendment to new technologies has created a number of issues that have recently come before the courts. In late November, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-ruling-against-warrantless-gps-tracking-to-stand.php">declined a request</a> [JURIST report] by the US Department of Justice to rehear a case in which that court found that the government could not use GPS to track suspects without a warrant. In September, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that at times the government might <a href="/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">need a warrant to obtain cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. In June, the US Supreme Court unanimously held that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an employer's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">search of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. Last year, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that police must <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">obtain a warrant before searching data stored in a cell phone</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The six individuals include current Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and several Ministry heads. All six are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of violence. Two summonses were <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc985613.pdf">issued</a> [Ruto, Kosgey, Sang summons, PDF; Muthara, Kenyatta, Ali <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc985621.pdf">summons</a>, PDF], each for three of the individuals in question, pursuant to Article 58 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF], for crimes against humanity. In issuing the summonses, ICC Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] stated:<blockquote>The post election period of 2007-2008 was one of the most violent periods of the nation's history. These were not just crimes against innocent Kenyans. They were crimes against humanity as a whole. By breaking the cycle of impunity for massive crimes, victims and their families can have justice. And Kenyans can pave the way to peaceful elections in 2012.</blockquote>US President Barack Obama has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/12/15/statement-president-obama-international-criminal-court-announcement">called on the Kenyan government to cooperate</a> [press release] fully with the ICC, even as the news of the summonses was <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=68036">met with derision by Kenyan officials</a> [KBC report].</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-kenya-threats-will-not-stop-election-violence-prosecutions.php">rejected the notion</a> [JURIST report] that threats of violence would delay the prosecution of the as-of-that-time unnamed suspects. Last month, the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, which implicated former Cabinet minster William Ruto of interfering with the ICC investigation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-rights-group-accuses-official-of-interfering-with-icc-election-investigation.php">denied accusations that it had bribed witnesses</a> [JURIST report]. Moreno-Campo had also said that the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-prosecutor-says-court-will-not-use-testimony-of-allegedly-bribed-kenya-witnesses.php">will not use testimony</a> [JURIST report] from three Kenyan witnesses who claim they were bribed to provide false evidence against a high-ranking government official.

The new detainee management system, <a href="http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/Smithtpl.cfm?CurrentId=11212">announced</a> [press release] Tuesday by Australian <a href="http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/smith/index.cfm">Minister of Defence Stephen Smith</a> [official website], provides for the systematic transfer of "high risk" detainees to US forces and "low risk" detainees to Afghan forces. According to AI Asia-Pacific director Sam Zarifi, the new policy puts detainees at risk of torture and mistreatment at the hands of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which has been previously linked to human rights abuses. "By handing over detainees to the NDS, where they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment, Australia could be in violation of its international obligations to protect individuals from such treatment," Zarifi said. Until August of this year, any detainees apprehended by the <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/">Australian Defence Force</a> (ADF) [official website] had been the responsibility of Dutch forces that, according to AI, had "safeguards" in place to assure detainees would not be mistreated. In his announcement, Smith stated that the new policies were in compliance with international law:<blockquote>The detainee management framework draws on applicable international standards and advice from international organisations, including the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website]. It is consistent with the Laws of Armed Conflict and the <a href="http://www.mineaction.org/downloads/Emine%20Policy%20Pages/Geneva%20Conventions/Geneva%20Convention%20III.pdf">Geneva Convention</a> [text, PDF]. Australian officials, both ADF and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, continue to monitor detainees'; welfare and conditions while they are in US or Afghan custody, until they are released or sentenced. The monitoring team visit detainees shortly after transfer and around every four weeks after the initial visits. </blockquote>Smith also reported that, since August, only 64 out of 348 detainees have been transferred to US or Afghan custody, with the rest being released. He also stated that both US and Afghan officials have assured that detainees will be treated humanely. According to Zarifi, AI is skeptical of these arrangements, which he says should be "viewed with extreme caution, given the very poor record of the US and Afghan governments when it comes to mistreating detainees." 

<p>An internal military probe in 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/australia-military-probe-clears.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] members of the Australian Defence Force of allegations that they mistreated four Taliban members detained following the death of an Australian soldier in Afghanistan. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/australian-military-investigating.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] also cleared soldiers of any wrongdoing in connection with civilian deaths during the November battle, but said that such deaths were "highly regrettable." Concerns over detainee abuse were first brought to light in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/nato-forces-exposing-detainees-to.php">2007 report</a> [JURIST report] in AI which said that the <a href="http://www.isaf.nato.int/">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) [official website], led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), was exposing terrorism detainees to risks of torture by transferring NATO-held detainees into custody of Afghanistan authorities. AI's report focused on actions by Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK, saying that the forces from those countries have been transferring terror detainees to the NDS, despite numerous reports of torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report alleges that Thaci was the leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Libertarian Army</a> (KLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo+war">news archive</a>] Drenica Group, a criminal network that controlled the heroin trade and the black market trafficking of kidneys of executed Serbian and Albanian war prisoners. The report goes on to accuse Thaci of evading justice by "eliminating or intimidating into silence the majority of the potential and actual witnesses against them" and by "faltering political will on the part of the international community to effectively prosecute the former leaders of the KLA" without which they "would have been convicted of serious crimes and would by now be serving lengthy prison sentences." News of the report's accusations were leaked by The <em>Guardian</em> earlier this week to which the Kosovar government <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,1782">responded</a> [press release] by calling the allegations false and an attempt to harm the reputation of Thaci, whose party won the nation's parliamentary elections earlier this year:<blockquote>The citizens of the Republic of Kosovo and wider international opinion will not believe the ill-intentioned fabrications of those who oppose the independence and sovereignty of our country and in absolutely no way, will they allow hooligans to defile the pure war of the Kosovo Liberation Army and the sacrifice of all the citizens of our country. The Government of the Republic of Kosovo calls on all member states of the Council of Europe to strongly oppose this fabricated and tendentious report and to not join the side of those who at all costs want to obstruct the stability, progress and good governance of the Republic of Kosovo.</blockquote>The draft report <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/europe/16kosovo.html?src=twrhp">will be submitted</a> [NY Times report] to a legal affairs committee on Thursday and will be formally debated in the Parliamentary Assembly on January 25. 

<p>Claims of Kosovo's involvement in human organ trafficking originated in 2008 when former prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=del+ponte">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged in a book</a> [JURIST report] on her time at the tribunal that about 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=organ+trafficking">organ trafficking</a> [JURIST news archive] during the war. That year, Serbian prosecutors condemned Albania's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/albania-prosecutor-refuses-to.php">refusal to initiate</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo. Albanian Prosecutor General Ina Rama refused to cooperate with Serbian war crimes prosecutor <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Vladimir Vukcevic</a> [official website] and said that her country would only pursue the allegations if the ICTY decided to reopen its investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], seeks civil penalties under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/lcwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> and asks the court to declare eight of the defendants liable without limitation under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act</a> [materials] for all removal costs and damages caused by the oil spill, including damages to natural resources. The defendants include BP Exploration and Production Inc.; Anadarko Exploration &#38; Production LP and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko Defendants); MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, Triton Asset Leasing GMBH, Transocean Holdings LLC, Transocean Offshore Deepwater Drilling Inc. and Transocean Deepwater Inc. (Transocean Defendants); and BP's insurer, QBE Underwriting Ltd./Lloyd's Syndicate 1036. Announcing the lawsuit, US Attorney General Eric Holder said:<blockquote>We intend to prove that these defendants are responsible for government removal costs, economic losses, and environmental damages without limitation. Even though the spill has been contained, the Department's focus on investigating this disaster and preventing future devastation has not wavered. Both our civil and criminal investigations continue, and our work to ensure that the American taxpayers are not forced to bear the costs of restoring the gulf area and its economy is moving forward.</blockquote>No dollar amount has been placed on the suit, as damages could take years to calculate, and a DOJ spokesperson said that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704828104576021762008860814.html?mod=WSJ_hp_MIDDLTopStories">additional defendants and claims</a> [WSJ report] could be added later.

<p>The government's lawsuit is one of hundreds filed against BP and other companies in connection with the oil spill. In August, the <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/index.html">US Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/Panel_Orders/Recent_Orders/MDL-2179-Transfer_Order.pdf">selected</a> [order, PDF] <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2808&amp;cid=999&amp;ctype=na&amp;instate=na">Judge Carl Barbier</a> [FJC profile] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/louisiana-district-judge-to-preside-over-oil-spill-lawsuits.php">hear</a> [JURIST report] more than 300 such lawsuits. Also that month, BP and the DOJ announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">completion of negotiations</a> over the implementation of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-to-set-aside-20-million-in-escrow-to-pay-oil-spill-damage-claims.php">$20 billion fund</a> [JURIST reports] to aid victims of the oil spill. In July, a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/072010wunstellsuit.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">report</a>] was filed against BP in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. In June, two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">filed against BP</a> [JURIST report] alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.] statute. The lawsuits allege that BP purposefully defrauded the American public in order to increase company profits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials], a piece of stand-alone legislation, was passed less than a week after the <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-blocks-vote-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">fell three votes short</a> [JURIST report] of the 60 votes necessary to approve a cloture motion on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN3454:">defense spending bill</a> [S 3454 materials] that would have included a provision for repeal. After the vote, Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) and <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/">Susan Collins</a> (R-ME) [official websites] said they <a target="_blank" href="http://collins.senate.gov/public/continue.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=cd687e4f-b8e8-907f-53d6-d408697dc11c&amp;CFID=60174682&amp;CFTOKEN=37944742">plan to introduce a separate piece of legislation</a> [press release] to repeal the ban, but its passage before the end of the current legislative session is uncertain. The House previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-house-approves-defense-spending-bill-containing-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">voted for repeal</a> [JURIST report] in May.

<p>The Obama administration has been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-committee-hears-military-chiefs-dont-ask-dont-tell-testimony.php">heard conflicting testimony</a> [JURIST report] from top military leaders on the services' readiness to repeal DADT. The hearing was held to review a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130%28secure-hires%29.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/dod-concludes-little-negative-impact-to-repealing-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>], released earlier that week, which concluded that repealing DADT would only minimally effect military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. Last month, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in November, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">112th Congress to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. Gates issued a memorandum in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior DOD officials. The policy was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">struck down</a> by a federal court in September, but an appeals court has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stayed that ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Security Council <a href="http://usun.state.gov/documents/organization/153129.pdf">approved three resolutions</a> [fact sheet, PDF] that eliminated the Development Fund for Iraq, lifted sanctions prohibiting civil nuclear projects and ended the controversial <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/">Oil-for-Food program</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/oilforfood.php">news archive</a>]. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=1037">praised the decision</a> [statement] as a "milestone" and said that the Council "recognize[d] how far the country has come in key aspects of its journey to normalize its status in the community of nations," particularly Iraq's participation in international anti-nuclear proliferation treaties. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice-president-biden">Vice President Joe Biden</a> [official profile] chaired the meeting and <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=S/PRST/2010/27&Lang=E&Area=UNDOC">commended</a> [statement] the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/default.asp">UN Assistance Mission in Iraq</a> (UNAMI) [official website] for its work in providing relief to the Iraqi people, a job that will likely continue as the US plans to withdraw troops from the country. The US will hold the Security Council presidency for the month of December. 

<p>The most recent UN Security Council resolutions mark a turning point for Iraq and an end to the UN oil-for-food program that generated international scandals. In July, <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric Co.</a> (GE) [corporate website] agreed to a <a href="http://www.genewscenter.com/Press-Releases/GE-Announces-Settlement-of-Oil-for-Food-Matter-29b8.aspx">$23.5 million settlement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ge-agrees-to-settle-sec-complaint-in-oil-for-food-scandal.php">report</a>] after the US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] filed a <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21602.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] accusing GE of bribing Iraqi officials to receive contracts under the oil-for-food program. The SEC claimed that, between 2000 and 2003, four of GE's subsidiaries gave millions of dollars worth of computer equipment, medical supplies and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry in exchange for contract deals. In April, a Paris judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-oil-company-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] French oil company <a href="http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html">Total</a> [corporate website] with bribery and complicity in connection with the scandal.

In a decision announced Tuesday, the court found that the law, which shielded military officials from prosecution, was incompatible with the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/b-32.html">American Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The court ordered the Brazilian government to conduct a criminal investigation into an anti-guerrilla military operation in the Araguaia region between 1972 and 1974. The court also ruled that 42 direct relatives of the victims should receive USD $45,000 each in compensation for their suffering and that 28 indirect relatives should receive $15,000 each. The ruled that all 70 relatives should also receive $3,000 each for medical and psychological treatment. Brazil's president-elect Dilma Rousseff, who takes office on January 1, has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/world/americas/16brazil.html">pledged to bring human rights violators to justice</a> [NYT report] and will be responsible for implementing the court's decision.

<p>Other Latin American countries have recently taken steps to end amnesties for their military dictatorships. In March, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-el-salvador-to.php">urged government officials in El Salvador</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/el-salvador-urged-repeal-amnesty-law-2010-03-23">repeal</a> [press release] a 1993 amnesty law that <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/el-salvador-defends-amnesty-laws.php">prevents any investigation</a> [JURIST report] into killings committed during the country's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], including the killing of respected Catholic Archbishop <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4376733.stm">Oscar Romero</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=oscar+romero">news archive</a>].

A federal grand jury charged Abdulmutallab Wednesday on two new counts of conspiracy and firearm possession, in addition to the six previous <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. Federal Judge Nancy Edmunds granted Abdulmutallab's request to represent himself, but also appointed a standby lawyer who will have access to discovery materials, saying that the appointment was necessary because of Abdulmutallab's <a href="http://thenewsnetwork.us/?tag=anthony-chambers">lack of training in US law</a> [TNN report]. Edmunds scheduled the next pretrial hearing for January 12 and set a deadline of February 26 for pretrial motions.

<p>Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/accused-plane-bomber-fires-lawyers-inquires-about-possible-guilty-plea.php">fired his court-appointed lawyers</a> [JURIST report] in September, accusing them of not serving his best interest and saying that he preferred to represent himself. Edmunds cautioned Abdulmutallab about proceeding without representation and questioned him for approximately 30 minutes regarding his knowledge of the law and criminal procedure. She ultimately allowed Abdulmutallab to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers, although she indicated that she believed the decision was not wise. In June, Edmunds <a href="paperchase/2010/06/federal-judges-refuses-to-allow-nigeria-to-observe-plane-bombing-trial.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed on behalf of the Nigerian government seeking to formally observe Abdulmutallab's trial, stating that the court record is already open to the public. The government <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-21/nigeria-asks-u-s-court-for-permission-to-enter-christmas-plane-bomb-case.html">sought to observe the proceedings</a> [Bloomberg report] in order to guarantee that Nigerian-born Abdulmutallab received a fair trial and that the reputation of Nigeria was protected, but the lawyer for the government later asked to withdraw the motion. In February, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-defends-decision-to-try.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to try the accused bomber in federal court rather than a military tribunal. Abdulmutallab has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges against him for allegedly attempting to set off an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 bound from Amsterdam to Detroit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A third conspirator, Abdel Nur, pleaded guilty in June to supporting the plot and faces a sentence of up to 15 years. A fourth member of the plot, Kareem Ibrahim, faces trial on the same charges as Kadir. US Attorney Loretta Lynch said, "'[t]he sentence imposed on Abdul Kadir sends a powerful and clear message. We will bring to justice those who plot to attack the United States of America."

<p>According to the original <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2007/Defreitas.complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plot was intended to "cause greater destruction than in the Sept. 11 attacks," according to one of the suspects. The plot could have destroyed parts of New York's <a href="http://www.queensbp.org/">borough of Queens</a> [official website], where an underground fuel pipeline serving the airport runs. Authorities were tracking the plot for more than a year before making the arrests. Defreitas had said he formed the plot more than a decade ago when he worked as a cargo handler. He said he chose the airport because its destruction would put "the whole country in mourning."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ireland has some of the most conservative abortion laws in Europe, prohibiting abortions except where there is a real and substantial <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/world/europe/17ireland.html?src=mv">risk to the life of the mother</a> [NYT report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/europe-rights-court-hears-ireland.php">case came before the court</a> [JURIST report] after three women filed suit alleging their rights were violated when they were forced to travel abroad for an abortion in 2005. Since a 1983 referendum, unborn children are afforded <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/16/ireland-urged-reform-abortion-legislation">equal constitutional rights as mothers</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. In 1992, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/HomeEN?OpenPage">Ireland Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that abortion was legal in Ireland when the mother's life was at risk, but the ECHR noted that doctors are loathe to counsel patients on the matter because they run the risk of "criminal conviction and imprisonment" if a doctor's medical opinion is subsequently overruled by another opinion. The ECHR stopped short of holding that abortion was an unlimited right, stating:<blockquote>The Court has also previously found, citing with approval the case-law of the former Commission, that legislation regulating the interruption of pregnancy touches upon the sphere of the private life of the woman, the Court emphasising [sic] that Article 8 cannot be interpreted as meaning that pregnancy and its termination pertain uniquely to the woman's private life as, whenever a woman is pregnant, her private life becomes closely connected with the developing foetus. The woman's right to respect for her private life must be weighed against other competing rights and freedoms invoked including those of the unborn child.</blockquote>The ECHR ruling is binding on Ireland, and Health Minister Mary Harvey acknowledged that new legislation will be necessary to <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2010/12/16/european-human-rights-court-faults-ireland-on-abortion-ban/">give effect to the ruling</a> [Reuters report], indicating it will take some time because of its <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/1216/breaking34.html">complex and sensitive nature</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report]. That burden may fall on the incoming government following elections in March. Both pro-life and pro-choice groups have claimed the ECHR ruling as a victory.

<p>Abortion has long been a hotly contested issue domestically and internationally. On Tuesday, an Alaska Superior Court judge refused to block a law requiring <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/alaska-judge-upholds-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">parental notification for women under the age of 18</a> [JURIST report] to have an abortion. Last Month, Colorado voters struck down a <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/LCS/Initiative%20Referendum/0910InitRefr.nsf/0/ed0d797d3ffe6fb0872576f5005c1efd/$FILE/Amendment%2062%20FinalDraftCombined.pdf">ballot initiative</a> [text, PDF] that would have amended the state's <a href="http://law.justia.com/colorado/constitution/index.html">constitution</a> [text] to extend rights to fetuses and would have <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">effectively outlawed abortion</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this year, reform to Spain's abortion laws sparked <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thousands-protest-spain-abortion-law.php">widespread protests</a> and elicited a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/spain-high-court-to-hear-constitutional-challenge-to-new-abortion-law.php">constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST reports] from Spain's conservative Popular Party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 2003 <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/darbenin-adi-balyoz.htm">Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [<em>Taraf</em> report, in Turkish; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">backgrounder</a>], or <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sledgehammer">"Sledgehammer" plot</a> [JURIST news archive], which included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane in order to undermine the government, was revealed by the <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/"><em>Taraf</em></a> [media website] newspaper in January. The military has maintained that the plot was a war game exercise. If convicted, the 196 defendants face up to 20 years in prison. The trial could take years to complete.

<p>In June, the trial of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">33 retired and active naval officers began</a> [JURIST report]. The officers were accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule in another plot planned by a group called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>].

Prosecutors in the case will attempt to link the 33 defendants to a plan to detonate a bomb in an Istanbul museum and the deaths of a Catholic priest, Protestant missionaries and journalist Hrant Dink. The investigations have strained relations between the religiously-inclined government and the secular military, which has been responsible for four coups in the last 50 years. Since the founding of the modern republic in 1923, the military has regarded itself as the defender of the secular legacy of founder <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [<em>Turkish News</em> profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The declaration, <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/un-adopts-treaty-supporting-rights-of.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, is a non-binding treaty outlining the global human rights of approximately 370 million indigenous people and banning discrimination against them. The US was one of four member states that originally opposed adopting the treaty, citing concerns that its text conflicted with their countries' own laws, among other contentions. At Thursday's press conference, however, Obama specifically expressed support for the Tribal Nations within the United States and the ways in which the government was committed to executing strategies to help meet the challenges of the Native American communities:<blockquote>Our strategy begins with the number one concern for all Americans right now -- and that's improving the economy and creating jobs. ... So to help spur the economy, we've boosted investment in roads throughout the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Reservation Road Program, and we've offered new loans to reach reservations with broadband. ... Another important part of our strategy is health care. We know that Native Americans die of illnesses like diabetes, pneumonia, flu -- even tuberculosis -- at far higher rates than the rest of the population. ... We're [also] rebuilding schools on tribal lands while helping to ensure that tribes play a bigger role in determining what their children learn. ... We're also working to improve the programs available to students at tribal colleges. And I'm confident that if we keep up our efforts, that if we continue to work together, that we will live up to the simple motto and we will achieve a brighter future for the First Americans and for all Americans.</blockquote>In addition, the US plans to implement strategies to attack the increasingly high crime rates that plague the Tribal Nation communities, to put more land in the hands of tribes and to upset the long-term history of government mistreatment of the Native American communities. 

<p>The US is the last member state of those in opposition to sign the declaration. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/canada-endorses-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">Canada endorsed</a> [JURIST report] the declaration <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/indig-autoch/un_declaration_nov2010_onu.aspx?lang=eng">citing</a> [statement] encouragement from community leaders and other countries' experiences in reversing its position on the document. The Canadian government described the move as one intended to strengthen relationships with indigenous communities. In April, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hbAWKRaeXVh9Xa6u2AMYKA8ci2EQ">New Zealand endorsed</a> [AFP report] the declaration, as did <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/australia-endorses-un-declaration-on.php">Australia</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pinochet himself was implicated in the disappearances, but he died in 2006 without ever facing trial. In July, the Chilean Supreme Court released a report <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/chile-high-court-releases-report-detailing-discrepancy-in-pinochet-fortune.php">detailing the secret fortune of Pinochet</a>, estimating it at over $20 million. This report joins another on Pinochet's hidden assets <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/chile-judge-discloses-report-detailing.php">released last September</a> [JURIST report]. That report concluded that Pinochet amassed USD $25,978,602 in accounts held outside of Chile, of which $20,199,753 is suspected to have been embezzled from official funds. The September report also concluded that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/internacional/20090902/chile-juez-precisa-fortuna-de-pinochet_34886_56917.html">funds were accumulated</a> [<em>Los Tiempos</em> report, in Spanish] over the period from 1973 to 2004, when a US Senate sub-committee investigation first <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/senate-report-says-us-banks-helped.php">uncovered the accounts</a> [JURIST report]. Victim advocates say the report supports allegations that Pinochet was the recipient of bribes and had other unlawful sources of income.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The provisions are envisaged under <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/docs/ab32text.pdf">Assembly Bill 32</a> (AB 32) [text, PDF; official <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cleanenergy/cleanenergy.htm">backgrounder</a>] and include a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101217/ap_on_bi_ge/us_california_greenhouse_gases">permit system</a> [AP report] in which companies are allotted a quota of greenhouse emissions. If a company does not use all of its quota, it can sell to a company that is going to exceed its quota. Companies that exceed their quota can purchase "offsets" from companies involved in activities that lessen greenhouse emissions, like forestry. The program is reportedly the first of this type in the country. Supporters of the bill in California say they felt compelled to enact AB 32 after Congress failed to approve greenhouse gas reduction legislation. They hope they other states will follow suit.

<p>In June, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] defeated a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.Res.26:">resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">report</a>] aimed at limiting the ability of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> [materials]. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] affirmed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions under the Clear Air Act in its 2007 ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/05-1120">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">report</a>]. In its ruling, the court held that if the EPA could show a link between greenhouse gas emissions and public health and welfare, then the act gives it the power to regulate emissions. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">announced last December</a> [JURIST report] that it had found that greenhouse gases "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. The EPA first announced its <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/epa-announces-proposed-findings-for.php">proposed finding</a> [JURIST report] in April before undertaking a 60-day public comment period. Some have suggested that the EPA findings have allowed Congress to avoid the <a href="/hotline/2009/04/epa-greenhouse-gas-finding-allows.php">political fallout</a> [JURIST comment] that could come from passing tough climate legislation. AB 32 was first <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/schwarzenegger-signs-first-us-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In October, a three-judge panel <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&amp;shofile=07-4080_052.pdf">upheld two</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-2-of-4-conrad-black-convictions.php">report</a>] of Black's four convictions, one for fraud and one for obstruction of justice. The court held that the other two fraud charges must be dismissed after the US Supreme Court upheld the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">"honest service" doctrine</a> [18 USC &#167; 1346 text] and ruled that it <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">applied</a> [JURIST report] to Black's case. On Friday, the court declined Black's request for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing to reconsider the two charges that were affirmed.

<p>Black originally faced 17 counts of fraud, obstruction of justice, racketeering and tax evasion. He was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/indict/2005/us_v_black.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] by the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/media-mogul-conrad-black-stands-trial.php">diverting more than $80 million from Hollinger International and its shareholders</a> [JURIST report] during Hollinger's $2.1 billion sale of several hundred Canadian newspapers. In July 2007, Black was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice and sentenced to 78 months in prison. The court of appeals initially rejected Black's appeal, holding that &#167; 1346 may be applied in a private setting regardless of whether the defendant's conduct risked any foreseeable economic harm to the victim. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> last year to determine the scope of the "honest services" clause, and held that Black had properly objected to the jury instructions at trial concerning the honest service doctrine and remanded the case to the circuit court for an opinion consistent with the judgment in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-enron-ex-ceo-appeal.php">Skilling v. United States</a> [JURIST report]. Black is also currently facing charges before the US Tax Court for <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-20/conrad-black-granted-bail-while-appealing-u-s-fraud-conviction.html">failure to pay nearly $71 million in taxes</a> [Bloomberg report]. He denies being obligated to pay the taxes because he is not a US citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the <a href="http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/dec/2010/BofAComplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [complaint; PDF] alleges that BOA violated a 2009 consent agreement, in which it agreed to develop and implement loan modification programs, by continuing to engage in widespread consumer fraud by misrepresenting to Arizona customers whether they were eligible for modifications of their mortgage loans. Additionally, Goddard alleges that BOA is also in violation of the <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/44/01522.htm&Title=44&DocType=ARS">Arizona Consumer Fraud Act</a> [text] by failing to offer loan modifications in a timely and promised manner and deceiving customers about the details surrounding load modification requests. As one of the states most impacted by the foreclosure crisis, Goddard expressed the urgency for immediate loan relief in Arizona:<blockquote>Bank of America has been the slowest of all the servicers to ramp up loss mitigation efforts in response to the housing crisis. It has shown callous disregard for the devastating effects its servicing practices have had on individual borrowers and on the economy as a whole...I am filing this lawsuit today because, after years of delay and broken promises, Arizonans should not have to wait any longer to seek redress. Our homeowners and communities need and deserve relief. Bank of America must be held accountable for its deceptive conduct and failed commitments.</blockquote>As a result of the alleged deceptive practices, many Arizona homeowners claimed they have lost their homes, dwindled their savings, or now owe more on their homes than before, all while continuing to make their mortgage payments. Nevada, which has faced more foreclosures than Arizona, subsequently filed suit against Bank of America for similar practices.

<p>Bank of America has recently been the target of other lawsuits alleging fraud. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] reached a $137 million <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-239.htm">settlement agreement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/bank-of-america-reaches-137-million-settlement-with-sec.php">report</a>] with BOA over <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/34-63451.pdf">fraud charges</a> [order, PDF] in a lawsuit that claimed BOA used anti-competitive bidding processes with 20 state municipalities. In June, BOA subsidiary Countrywide Home Loans, Inc <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bank-of-america-subsidiary-reaches-108-million-settlement-with-ftc.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0823205/100607countrywideorder.pdf">$108 million settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] in response to a lawsuit that charged it with collecting excessive fees from homeowners facing foreclosure. In February, the Attorney General of New York brought a suit against BOA for <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/new-york-ag-sues-bank-of-america-for.php">misleading shareholders</a> [JURIST report] by not disclosing to share holders their loss profits.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials), a piece of stand-alone legislation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">was passed</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday by the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website]. Last week, the Senate fell <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-blocks-vote-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">three votes short</a> [JURIST report] of the 60 votes necessary to approve a cloture motion on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN3454:">defense spending bill</a> [S 3454 materials] that whould have included a provision for repeal. The legislation will now go to President Obama, who is expected to sign it early next week. The president, secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff must then <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704368004576027630255811672.html">certify</a> [WSJ report] that the necessary policies and procedures are in place within the military. After receiving certification, the full repeal must take effect within 60 days. 

<p>The Obama administration has been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-committee-hears-military-chiefs-dont-ask-dont-tell-testimony.php">heard conflicting testimony</a> [JURIST report] from top military leaders on the services' readiness to repeal DADT. The hearing was held to review a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_gatesdadt/DADTReport_FINAL_20101130%28secure-hires%29.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/dod-concludes-little-negative-impact-to-repealing-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>], released earlier that week, which concluded that repealing DADT would only minimally effect military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. Last month, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in November, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called on the 112th Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/gates-calls-for-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell-before-seating-of-new-congress.php">to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report]. Gates issued a memorandum in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/defense-secretary-issues-memo-requiring-greater-authority-for-discharges-made-under-dont-ask-dont-te.php">limiting the authority to discharge openly gay service members</a> [JURIST report] to five senior DOD officials. The policy was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">struck down</a> by a federal court in September, but an appeals court has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stayed that ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2008, voters in Eureka and Arcata each passed the <a href="http://www.stoprecruitingkids.org/?q=node/2">Youth Protection Act</a> [text], identical ballot measures which prohibited the military recruitment of children under the age of 18. The Coalition to <a href="http://www.stoprecruitingkids.org/">Stop Recruiting Kids!</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.stoprecruitingkids.org/?q=node/5">accused</a> [materials] recruiters of ignoring the dangers of military service while exaggerating the benefits. The cities argued that the ordinances prohibit conduct already forbidden by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict</a> [text], which the US ratified in 2002, and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. The appeals court rejected the arguments because the ordinances impose greater restrictions on military recruitment than federal law and the regulation of federal military recruitment policies is not a power reserved to the states. The appeals court concluded that the ordinances were unconstitutional under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, first descrobed in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0017_0316_ZO.html">McCulloch v. Maryland</a> [opinion, text], because they expressly and directly regulate and discriminate against the federal government's recruitment policies and the conduct of federal agents.

<p>Military recruitment policies recently became an issue in the June <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sessions-questions-kagain-on-judicial-philosophy-solomon-act-as-hearings-continue.php">confirmation hearings</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=elena+kagan">Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan</a> [JURIST news archive]. During her deanship at <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/index.html">Harvard Law School</a> [academic website], Kagan reinstated a prohibition against military recruiters because the military's<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html"> "Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>] policy violated the school nondiscrimination code. In 2006, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the 1996 <a href="http://www.yalerotc.org/Solomon.html">Solomon Amendment</a> [text, Georgetown <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/solomon/solomon.html">backgrounder</a>], which blocks federal funding for schools refusing to allow military recruitment on campus. The military's DADT policy was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] on Saturday. After September 11th, US military branches have <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-military-accepting-more-recruits.php">increased recruiting waivers</a> and continue to <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-army-enlisting-more-recruits-with.php">enlist a greater number of recruits with criminal records</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/home-secretary/">Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12022613">attempted to sidestep Parliament</a> [BBC report] in enacting the temporary cap ahead of a permanent cap set to take effect next April. Judges ruled that May's attempt to circumvent parliamentary review violated the <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1578007">1971 Immigration Act</a> [text]. The government will have an opportunity to introduce the measure before Parliament in January.  <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/damian-green/">Immigration Minister Damian Green</a> [official profile] said the government <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6BG4WV20101217">might appeal the ruling</a> [Reuters report], but does not believe that this decision on the temporary cap will affect the permanent cap.

Officials argue that the temporary cap is necessary to avoid a flood of applications from immigrants seeking to enter the UK before the permanent cap goes into effect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko, whose government was dissolved in March after she narrowly lost the presidential election to <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6BJ1K520101220">accused</a> [Reuters report] of misusing money raised by selling carbon emission rights. Tymoshenko claims that the investigation is politically motivated and maintains her innocence. She has <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_20_12_7">pledged to appear for questioning</a> [press release, in Ukrainian], stating, "I fear nothing."

<p>In May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. The probe was initiated in May 2004 and then <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/ukraine-prosecutors-close-criminal.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in June 2005. In February, Tymoshenko <a href="paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-challenging.php">withdrew</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-files-lawsuit-challenging.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] filed in the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine claiming that the country's presidential election was corrupt. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election. The opposition leader has a history of being at the center of controversial political moments in Ukraine. In March 2009, she <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/ukraine-pm-calls-for-constitutional.php">called for constitutional changes</a> [JURIST report] to provide more separation between parliamentary and presidential powers. In October 2008, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-against.php">withdrew a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] she had brought against then-president <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko+">Victor Yushchenko</a> [JURIST news archive] after he suspended a plan to hold early elections following the collapse of the country's coalition government. Before suspending the plan, Yushchenko had issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ukraine-president-dissolves-kiev-court.php">abolishing a Kiev court</a> after it <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ukraine-court-blocks-election-decree.php">tried to block</a> [JURIST reports] his order dissolving parliament.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision represents a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government under <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. Instead, Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. The LLRC's credibility, however, has been contested by several human rights organizations, which say the <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lanka-allows-un-panel-to-visit-colombo/137842-2.html">commission lacks objectivity</a> [PTI report]. The change in position follows economic sanctions including the withdrawal of trade concessions worth $150 million per year with the EU. The government has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces violated international law during the conflict. Skeptics have already questioned whether the UN panelists will be given free access to investigate. The three-person panel, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-sg-appoints-panel-to-investigate-sri-lanka-civil-war-rights-abuses.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile], has not set a date to travel to Sri Lanka.

<p>In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/sri-lanka-government-defends-war-crimes-commission.php">Sri Lankan government defended the LLRC</a> [JURIST report] after international human rights groups <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW), <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and the <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/">International Crisis Group</a> (ICG) [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/10/13/joint-letter-llrc">publicly declined an invitation</a> [joint letter; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-groups-reject-invitation-to-testify-in-sri-lanka-civil-war-probe.php">report</a>] to testify, stating that they would welcome the opportunity to appear before the commission if they felt it was a genuine and credible effort to pursue accountability and reconciliation. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-war-crimes-commission-begins-public-hearings.php">LLRC began public hearings</a> [JURIST report] in August with an appearance by <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Sri Lanka Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-defense-minister-defends-government-conduct-during-civil-war.php">defended the actions of the government</a> [JURIST report] during the conflict. The LLRC was <a href="http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20100605_05">appointed</a> [press release] in May amid repeated <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/report-reveals-porential-war-crimes-by-sri-lanka-security-forces.php">claims of war crimes by human rights groups</a> after president Rajapksha initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sri-lanka-president-rejects-proposed-un.php">rejected the UN panel</a> [JURIST reports] in March.<br />

According to the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/preliminary-crime-in-the-us-2009">Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report of 2010</a> [text], the number of reported violent crimes between January and June decreased 6.2 percent when compared to statistics from the same period in 2009. Specifically, the number of murders dropped by 7.1 percent, robberies dropped by 10.7 percent, aggravated assaults dropped by 3.9 percent and forcible rapes dropped 6.2 percent. Additionally, property crime has continued to decrease for the eighth year in a row by 2.8 percent, specifically with 9.7 percent fewer motor vehicle thefts, 2.3 percent fewer larceny thefts, and 1.4 percent fewer burglaries. The FBI compiled the data from crime statistics from more than 12,000 city, county, university and college, state, tribal, and federal agencies nationwide.

<p>In September, the FBI released its <a href="http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/index.html">Crime in the United States 2009</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/fbi-report-shows-decrease-in-us-violent-crime-for-third-straight-year.php">report</a>] report disclosing that violent crime in the nation decreased 5.3 percent and property crime decreased 4.6 percent, when compared to data from 2008. The drop in 2009 follows a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/fbi-report-shows-decrease-in-us-violent.php">1.9 percent decrease</a> for 2008 and a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-report-shows-decrease-in-us-violent.php">0.7 percent decrease</a> [JURIST reports] for 2007.

We are especially concerned over excessive use of force by the authorities, including the beating and detention of several presidential candidates and violence against journalists and civil society activists. ... We call on the Government of Belarus to exercise restraint during the remainder of the electoral process, which should be free of further intimidation and violence.</blockquote><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for the immediate release of those arrested for peaceful participation.

<p>Hundreds of <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports].While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] has historically <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136021.htm">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [2009 report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">report</a>].

The groups announced in August that they would <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-to-continue-suit-against-terror-suspect-defense-licensing.php">pursue a legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the scheme despite being issued a license to represent <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/anwar_al_Awlaki/index.html">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>], a US citizen who was labeled an SDGT in July. The SDGT designation is issued by the Treasury Department <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/">Office of Foreign Assets Control</a> (OFAC) [official website] under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_35.html">federal law</a> [50 USC &#167; 1701 <em>et seq.</em> text], freezing the assets of the individual and preventing the provision of legal services without a license from the government. As of December 7, the policy was changed so that uncompensated lawyers may represent SDGT individuals in any US court or agency without first seeking a license from the government. ACLU legal fellow Jonathan Manes <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/government-changes-attorney-licensing-regulations-response-lawsuit-filed-ccr-and-a">welcomed the new policy</a> [press release], saying, "OFAC's regulations infringed both the free speech rights of attorneys and the due process rights of Americans, but the changes that OFAC has made in response to our lawsuit bring the regulations in line with the Constitution."

<p>Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2010cv1469-31">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">report</a>] a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in al-Awlaki's case. Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the ACLU and the CCR on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain. Bates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case last month on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Awlaki, a suspected member of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is believed to be linked to Major Nidal Hasan, the Fort Hood shooting suspect, as well as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier in November, Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners. Awlaki is believed to be hiding in Yemen and was charged <em>in absentia</em>. US officials have labeled Awlaki as a terrorist and have placed him on a list to be captured or killed. The Yemeni government has sent forces on a counter-terrorism operation into the Province of Shabwa, where it is believed that Awlaki is hiding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There were 46 executions in 2010, compared to 52 in 2009. The report also notes that the number of new death sentences for 2010 is projected to be 114&#8212;close to 2009's figure of 112, which represented the lowest number of new death sentences since the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] reinstated the death penalty in 1976. DPIC attributes the decrease in executions to several factors, including controversy over <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">lethal injections</a> [JURIST news archive] and evidence of mistakes in Texas:<blockquote>The carrying out of executions remained controversial and cumbersome in 2010. Over 40 execution dates were stayed, many because of continuing problems with the process of lethal injections. ... Evidence of critical errors made in cases where an execution has occurred continued to mount in Texas. ... Such examples have caused deep concerns about the death penalty not only in Texas but across the country.</blockquote>The report also states that a recent poll shows 61 percent of Americans would choose various alternative sentences over the death penalty as the proper punishment for murder.

<p>The trends are similar to those observed in the DPIC's <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/2009YearEndReport.pdf">2009 report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-execution-rate-now-half-that-of.php">report</a>]. While the report did show that the number of executions increased from 37 in <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/2008YearEnd.pdf">2008</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-sees-drop-in-executions-death.php">report</a>], it attributed those numbers to a backlog of cases resulting from a de facto <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty. Executions resumed in the US in April 2008 after the Supreme Court lifted an effective ban on the death penalty by <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">upholding the constitutionality of lethal injection</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://asia.news.yahoo.com/afp/20101221/ttc-venezuela-media-law-internet-0de2eff.html">law expands 2004 restrictions</a> [AFP report] on television, radio and print media to Internet and electronic subscription services content. The National Assembly announced that the law <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=28686:an-continua-discusion-de-reforma-de-ley-de-responsabilidad-en-radio-television-y-medios-electronicos&Itemid=50&lang=es">aims to promote Venezuelan values</a> [press release, in Spanish], guarantee freedom of expression and diffuse information that "contributes to the formation of a social conscience" of the population. Media organizations that violate the new measure face increased fines, as well as the possible revocation of media licenses for repeat offenders. The law moved through the unicameral National Assembly in less than a week by the ruling party led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1925236.stm">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hugo+chavez">news archive</a>]. Opposition leaders disapprove of the new law, arguing that it restricts freedom of speech and violates constitutionally granted rights.

<p>The Venezuelan government has faced criticism for repeatedly restricting freedom of expression. In June, the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] sent a letter to the Venezuelan government expressing concern over the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/relatoria/showarticle.asp?artID=800&lID=1">increasing threat to freedom of expression</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-commission-concerned-over-freedom-of-expression-in-venezuela.php">report</a>] in the country. In July 2009, Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22726&Itemid=27">proposed legislation</a> [press release, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/venezuela-ag-proposes-law-limiting.php">report</a>] to limit the media's freedom of expression in certain circumstances, citing the importance of national security. Under the proposed law, journalists would face up to four years in prison for "threatening the social peace, security and independence of the nation, public order, stability of state institutions, mental health, and public morals and for generating a climate of impunity or insecurity. Prior to the proposed legislation, the <a href="http://www.uscirf.gov/">US Commission on International Religious Freedom</a> (USCIRF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-religious-freedom-report-adds-iraq.php">added Venezuela to its "watch list"</a> [JURIST report] of countries that limit religious freedom in May 2009. In February 2009, the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">criticized Venezuela</a> [JURIST report] for press restrictions in its 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court sentenced Dusan Jankovic to 27 years, Zoran Babic and Milorad Skrbic to 22 years, and Zeljko Stojnic to 15 years in prison. A fifth suspect, Milorad Radakovic, was acquitted for lack of evidence. The defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bosnia-prosecutor-indicts-8-bosnian.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] last January, accused of taking part in the August 21, 1992, massacre of at least 150 Muslims and Croat civilians as part of an ethnic cleansing on Mount Vlasic. The prisoners, who were told they were being released, were taken to the woods and forced to kneel at the edge of a ravine where they were then shot. Three other defendants were previously jailed in connection with the massacre after pleading guilty. In 2004, the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mrda/tjug/en/sj-040331.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF] former Bosnian Serb "Intervention Squad" officer <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mrda/cis/en/cis_mrdja_en.pdf">Darko Mrdja</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF] to 17 years in prison for his role in the killings.

<p>The BiH war crimes court was established in 2005 to assist with the ICTY caseload. Last month, a suspected war criminal was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> during the end of the Bosnian civil war. The <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?jezik=e">Prosecutors Office for BiH</a> [official website] announced that Dragan Crnogorac was arrested on suspicion for having committed genocide under Article 171 of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/criminal-code-of-bih.pdf">BiH criminal code</a> [text, PDF]. In August, Spanish officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/spain-extradites-montenegrin-war-crimes-suspect-to-bosnia.php">extradited accused Montenegrin war criminal</a> [JURIST report] Veselin Vlahovic, known as the "monster of Grbavica," to Sarajevo. He is wanted on three international arrest warrants, including one for the rape, torture and murder of more than 100 women and children and is expected to face genocide charges before the country's war war crimes court. Also in August, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bosnia-court-indicts-military-officers-for-genocide-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">issued genocide charges</a> [JURIST report] against four former Bosnian Serb soldiers in connection with the Srebrenica massacr, alleging that they were all members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment in the army of Republika Srpska. They are accused of participating in the murder of more than 800 Bosnian Muslims during the massacre. In April, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-31-years-for.php">convicted two men of genocide</a> [JURIST report], Radomir Vukovic and Zoran Tomic, for their roles in the Srebrenica massacre and sentenced each to 31 years imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The fines stem from two investigations conducted by the <a href = "http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. The first, a fine of $16.375 million, concerned nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals entrapped by floor mats, which caused at least one fatal accident in California. The second, a fine of $16.050 million, resulted from Toyota's failure to notify the NHTSA of a safety defect in several Toyota models' steering relay rods. In that situation, Toyota had already recalled the faulty products in Japan in 2004, but delayed recall in the US until 2005. In a <a href = "http://www.nhtsa.gov/PR/DOT-216-10">press release</a> [text], NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said, "NHTSA acknowledges Toyota's efforts to make improvements to its safety culture, and our agency will continue to hold all automakers accountable for defects to protect consumers' safety." Toyota also announced news of the settlement in a <a href = "http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota-issues-statement-regarding-189535.aspx">press release</a> [text], stating that they were "pleased to have resolved these legacy issues related to the timeliness of prior recalls dating back to 2005." The total fines against Toyota amount to $48.8 million and will be paid into the Treasury Department's General Fund. Although the NHTSA investigations have been satisfied, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/california-judge-combines-state-court-claims-against-toyota.php">consumer-fraud class action and personal injury lawsuits</a> stemming from the same safety defects remain open in California as well as in <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-sets-date-for-toyota.php">federal court</a> [JURIST reports].

<p>In April, Toyota accepted a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/done-us-dot-imposes-record-16-million.php">record civil penalty of $16.375 million</a> [JURIST report], imposed by the NHTSA for a four-month delay in notifying the agency about a problem with "sticky" and "slow to return pedal" gas pedals in various car models. A week earlier, the <a href = "http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/">US Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation</a> (MDL) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/us-federal-panel-consolidates-lawsuits.php">consolidated</a> [JURIST report] more than 150 pending lawsuits against Toyota and transferred them to the <a href = "http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website]. In March, the NHTSA enlisted the help of the <a href = "http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) and <a href = "http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> [official websites] to conduct a 15-month investigation into the sources of recent safety defects. Toyota has been under federal scrutiny since December 2009, and has conducted several recalls. Toyota's product recalls have been analyzed by Forum guest columnist Bruce Aronson of Creighton University School of Law in the op-ed <a href = "/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">Learning from Toyota's Troubles - Where's the Board?</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to a spokesperson for the South Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC), the court <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-s-SSRC-working-on-response,37354">ordered the group to respond to one of the suits</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> report] by December 26. Some <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6BJ0FI20101220?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">claim the lawsuits are frivolous</a> [Reuters report] and that groups are filing them to delay the vote in which the south is expected to choose to break off from the north. One suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sudan-civil-society-group-challenges-southern-referendum.php">filed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] accused the SSRC of failing to adhere to proper procedures in voter registration and of improperly appointing pro-secession advocates to important posts in the SSRC. The referendum is scheduled to begin January 9, but it may be delayed if the pending lawsuits are not resolved by then.

<p>The referendum is meant to be the culmination of the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8306.doc.htm">2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) [UN press release] that ended two decades of civil war. In September, the UN Security Council issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc10031.doc.htm">statement</a> [text] calling on the CPA parties to take "urgent action to facilitate peaceful and on-time referenda that reflect the will of the Sudanese people, to respect their results, and to resolve key remaining post-referenda issues." In April, Sudan attempted to have its first democratic multi-party election in almost a quarter of a century, but it was fraught with controversy. Two political parties in eastern Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sudan-opposition-parties-accuse-ruling.php">accused the ruling NCP</a> [JURIST report] of using voter fraud and intimidation in gaining electoral victories in their region of the country during the national elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The so-called <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">net neutrality</a> [JURIST news archive] rules, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-proposes-new-rules-for-internet-regulation.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] by FCC Chairman <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] earlier this month, would prevent Internet providers from selectively blocking web access. The regulations would require transparency of Internet broadband networks to help consumers make better decisions about services, preserve open access to all lawful Internet content and protect freedom of speech in the "marketplace of ideas" online. Genachowski <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db1220/DOC-303713A1.pdf">said</a> [press release, PDF]:<blockquote>The open Internet is a crucial American marketplace, and I believe that it is appropriate
for the FCC to safeguard it by adopting an Order that will establish clear rules to protect consumers' access. The Commission has worked tirelessly to offer a set of guidelines that, while not as strong as they could be, will nonetheless protect consumers as they explore, learn, and innovate online.</blockquote>Supporters of net neutrality have argued the rules do not go far enough, while opponents have called them unnecessary. The regulations may be blocked by Congress, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703581204576033513990668654.html">legal challenges are expected</a> [WSJ report].

<p>The FCC has long been trying to exert more control over Internet regulation. In July, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] introduced <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/demint.net.neutrality.bill.072110.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/senators-introduce-legislation-to-block-fcc-broadband-plan.php">report</a>] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] found that the FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. Telecommunications companies <a target="_blank" href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/">AT&#38;T</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites] argue that net neutrality would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/">Public Interest Lawyers</a> (PIL) [law firm website], the group representing a group of more than140 Iraqis, appealed to the High Court after <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/People/Ministers/SecretaryOfStateForDefence.htm">Defence Secretary Liam Fox</a> [official website] refused to open a single public inquiry into allegations of UK military abuse. The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] argued that a public inquiry would be unnecessary since public inquiries into the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/uk-announces-public-inquiry-into-2003.php">Baha Mousa</a> [JURIST report] and the Al Sweady cases were already under way by the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT). In the appeal, PIL contended that IHAT was not sufficiently independent as required by <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text]. Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Silber ruled that IHAT met the requirements of article 3, stating:<blockquote>we do not accept any of the grounds on which the claimant contends that IHAT lacks the requisite independence for the purposes of an article 3 compliant investigation. Any problem arising out of personal involvement by members of the RMP in the events under investigation can be dealt with appropriately and will have to be so dealt with in order to avoid jeopardising the compliance of the process with article 3.</blockquote>Richards and Sibler did not rule out that the IHAT investigations may give rise to systemic issues that may require public inquiries in the future. PIL issued a statement on Tuesday <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/news_details.php?id=42">expressing their disappointment</a> [press release] and announcing their plan to take the case to the Court of Appeals.  

<p>The hearings into Fox's refusal to open public inquiries <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-court-begins-iraq-detainee-abuse-hearings.php">began in November</a> [JURIST report]. The PIL submitted videos to support claims that UK soldiers and interrogators abused Iraqi detainees in British internment facilities. In September, an MOD report found that the UK's treatment of detainees <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/uk-defense-ministry-report-finds-little-wrong-with-detainee-treatment.php">complies with domestic and international law</a> [JURIST report]. In July, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">create a panel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate claims that British government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas. The investigation stems from a civil action, brought by 12 ex-detainees who allege that British agents participated in their abuse while they were held in prisons in Pakistan, Morocco and other countries. The UK will ask them to drop their lawsuits in exchange for possible compensation and a promise that the impending inquiry will fully investigate their claims. In June, the UK government indicated that it will issue a new set of regulations regarding the use of information <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">obtained via torture</a> [JURIST report] as claims of complicity in torture were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">report</a> [materials] released the same day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Vaughn Walker found in March that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] warrantless wiretapping program violated the rights of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haramain">Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation</a> [JURIST news archive] under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text], granting the foundation's motion for summary judgment despite refusing to admit a confidential NSA document into evidence. While Walker ordered the government to pay attorney's fees and damages Tuesday, he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/us/22charity.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">declined to order punitive damages</a> [NYT report], concluding that the government had not shown "reckless or callous indifference" to the plaintiffs' rights. Walker also declined to make a "declaration that defendants' warrantless electronic surveillance was unlawful as a violation of FISA," or to "order that any information obtained by means of the defendants' unlawful surveillance shall not be used by the United States government in any proceeding and shall be expunged from defendants' files and records."

<p>Al-Haramain <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/islamic-charity-seeks-summary-judgment.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] for partial summary judgment in July 2009. In February 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-denies-government-appeal.php">affirmed</a> the district court's <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-revives-islamic-charity.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] denying a government appeal to keep the NSA call log secret, despite its accidental release to Al-Haramain in 2004. The call log had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-rules-against.php">deemed a state secret</a> [JURIST report], but the decision required the government to allow the foundation to view the document. JURIST contributor Victor Comras said that Walker had done a "truly remarkable job" balancing <a href="/hotline/2009/03/judge-finds-proper-balance-between-due.php">national security and due process</a> [JURIST comment] in the case. Walker had previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-rules-executive-privilege.php">dismissed the suit</a> [JURIST report], finding that Al-Haramain lacked a cause of action because the state secrets privilege trumped procedural requirements under FISA</p>]]></content:encoded>

After receiving certification, the full repeal must take effect within 60 days.

<p>The Obama administration had been pushing Congress to repeal DADT as courts have also been weighing in on the issue. Last week, three former service members discharged under DADT filed a complaint against the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/former-service-members-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-file-suit-seeking-reinstatement.php">seeking reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] and the declaration that their discharges under the statute, and the statute itself, are unconstitutional. Last month, US Air Force Major Margaret Witt, who was discharged under DADT, became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-officer-discharged-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-to-be-reinstated-as-doj-appeals.php">first openly gay person to serve in the US military</a> after the Obama administration did not pursue a stay of a previous federal court decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-rejects-dont-ask-dont-tell-discharge.php">ordering her reinstatement</a> [JURIST reports]. The policy was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-strikes-down-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">struck down</a> by a federal court in September, but an appeals court has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stayed that ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its <a href="http://www.ottawasun.com/news/canada/2010/12/22/16642851.html">advisory opinion</a> [<em>Ottawa Sun</em> report], the divided court held that the power to regulate the clinics and doctors conducting fertility treatments and embryonic research, previously delegated to the federal government by the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/A/A-13.4.pdf">Assisted Human Reproduction Act</a> [text, PDF], rightly belongs to the provinces, which have jurisdiction over hospitals and other important local matters. The case was originally brought by the <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/ministre/biographie-a.htm">Attorney General of Quebec</a> [official profile], who challenged the constitutionality of certain sections on the basis that they were not valid criminal law, limited only to prohibiting wrongful acts, but that they instead sought to regulate medical practice and research. In 2008, the <a href="http://dev.tribunaux.qc.ca/mjq_en/c-appel/index-ca.html">Court of Appeal of Quebec</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canadian-reproductive-regulation-ruled.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the challenged sections did constitute an attempt by Parliament to regulate hospitals and medical research and declared them unconstitutional. The <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/mag-mpg/index.html">Attorney General of Canada</a> [official profile] appealed to the Supreme Court. While the court did concede that those sections fall outside of the scope of the federal government, much of the Act remains intact. In her reasoning, the Chief Justice stated:<blockquote>The text of the Act suggests that its dominant purpose is to prohibit inappropriate practices, rather than to promote beneficial ones. It is true that the Act establishes a scheme to control assisted reproduction on a national level, and this initiative necessarily touches on provincial jurisdiction over medical research and practice. However, the dominant thrust of the Act is prohibitory, and the aspects that concern the provision of health services do not rise to the level of pith and substance. As s. 2 of the Act explains, the purpose of the Act is to safeguard against practices that may offend fundamental values and rights and harm human health, safety and dignity. The emphasis is on preventing practices that offend these values and produce this harm. The Act accomplishes its purpose of prohibiting reprehensible conduct by imposing sanctions. The Act is essentially a series of prohibitions, followed by a set of subsidiary provisions for their administration. </blockquote>While Quebec has already passed legislation regulating the issues of fertility and reproduction, other provinces that have not yet done so would be required to enact their own.

<p>Canada's ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=human+cloning">human cloning</a> [JURIST news archive] was first <a href="/paperchase/2003/10/canada-set-to-ban-human-cloning.htm">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in 2003, and the Assisted Human Reproduction Act has been <a href="http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=335">praised</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.ias.unu.edu/">Center for Genetics and Society</a> [advocacy website], a group seeking comprehensive regulation of embryonic use. In 2007, the UN University Institute for Advanced Studies [official website] called for a universal <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-group-calls-for-human-cloning-ban.php">ban on human cloning</a>, but numerous <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/australia-ends-ban-on-stem-cell.php">countries</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/missouri-narrowly-approves-stem-cell.php">US states</a> [JURIST reports] have increasingly liberalized non-cloning use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=embryonic">human embryos</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation would block <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and the other accused 9/11 conspirators from being tried in a US civilian court. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-approves-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">approved by the House</a> [JURIST report] last week, prompting US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] to send a <a href="/paperchase/AG%20CR%20Letter%2012-9-10.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urging them not to include the provision in the spending bill. If signed into law, the ban will remain in place until September 30, the end of the current fiscal year. Also this week, reports have indicated that the Obama administration is considering implementing a periodic review process for detainees being held indefinitely at Guantanamo.

<p>In the first civilian trial of an ex-Guantanamo detainee, a federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ex-guantanamo-detainee-acquitted-on-all-but-one-charge.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ahmed_khalfan_ghailani.htm">Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani</a> [GlobalSecurity profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ghailani">news archive</a>] last month on only one of 285 counts of conspiracy, murder and attempted murder for his involvement in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombings of US embassies</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=embassy+kenya+tanzania">news archive</a>] in Tanzania and Kenya. While the Obama administration viewed the conviction and 20-year minimum sentence as a victory, opponents have cited the acquittals as evidence that civilian courts are inadequate venues for trying terror suspects. Several scholars have nevertheless maintained that federal courts are <a href="/forum/2010/11/ghailani-verdict-a-victory-for-american-justice.php">capable of serving justice</a> [JURIST op-ed; JURIST <a href="/forum/2010/11/the-ghailani-trial-justice-served.php">op-ed</a>]. Upon taking office, President Barack Obama pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report] by January 2010, but he has been met with strong congressional opposition to transferring detainees to US soil</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new START treaty replaces the expired <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START I treaty) [materials], with Russia and the US each pledging to reduce their countries' nuclear warheads by about 30 percent. Under the terms of the treaty and its protocol, both countries would only be allowed to deploy 1,550 strategic warheads, a decrease from the 2,200 currently permitted. Senator <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/">John Kerry</a> (D-MA), head of the <a href="http://foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official websites], praised the ratification, saying:<blockquote>This historic Senate vote makes our country safer and moves the world further away from the danger of nuclear disaster. The winners are not defined by party or ideology. The winners are the American people, who are safer with fewer Russian missiles aimed at them, and who benefit knowing that our cooperation with Russia in curbing Iran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions and supplying our troops in Afghanistan can be strengthened.</blockquote>The treaty needed at least 67 votes to be ratified.

<p>US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> and Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague in April. The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration.

The <a href="http://www.justiciacordoba.gov.ar/site/default.asp">Federal Court of Cordoba</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1335940">found Videla guilty</a> [<em>La Nacion</em> report, in Spanish] of human rights violations when he served as military chief of Argentina from 1976 to 1981. Many of the two dozen former military and police officials, including retired general <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/tort/ejercito/menendez/">Luciano Benjamin Menendez</a> [Project Disappeared profile, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=luciano+menendez">news archive</a>], were tried and sentenced to life prison terms along with Videla. Videla accepted responsibility for his actions during the dictatorship, but denied that he had committed human rights violations. In 1985, Videla was convicted and sentenced of similar crimes, but served only five years of the life sentence before being granted amnesty by former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1376100.stm">Carlos Menem</a> [BBC profile]. Videla will serve his sentence in a civilian prison.

<p>Videla's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/former-argentina-dictator-goes-on-trial-for-dirty-war-rights-violations.php">trial commenced</a> in July after he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/argentina-ex-military-leader-facing-additional-murder-charges.php">charged with an additional 49 counts</a> [JURIST reports] of murder, kidnapping and torture in May following the identification of 40 bodies in Buenos Aires last year. In 2006, a federal judge ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/argentina-judge-rules-dirty-war-pardon.php">presidential pardon was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], allowing criminal charges to be brought against the former dictator. Videla, who is now 85, is also facing charges in <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/italy-seeks-extradition-of-139-in-south.php">Italy</a>, Spain, France and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-videla.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports] involving the deaths of their citizens during the Dirty War. Videla has been in prison since 2008 while an investigation is underway for his role in the abduction of children born to political prisoners and forced disappearance victims during the Dirty War. A court revoked the house arrest conditions he had been granted in 1998 when the investigation began. During the period Videla was head of the military junta, an estimated 90,000 civilians were killed or disappeared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday that he had <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/EB76851B-C125-4E70-8271-D781C54E2A65.htm">not yet opened an investigation</a> [statement] but that he would do so if crimes were committed in his jurisdiction.

In February, Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the country's parliament and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections, the first in a decade. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged Soro with creation of new government and new election format. Gbagbo had accused Beugre Mambe, the head of the independent electoral commission, of fraud by attempting to register more than 400,000 whom Gbagbo considers to be foreigners. Opposition parties such as the <a href="http://www.rdrci.org/actu.asp">Ivory Coast Democratic Party</a> (PDCI) and <a href="http://pdcirda.org/">Republican Gathering Party</a> (RDR) [party websites, in French] said that most of those voters are ethnic groups in the north of the country, who would likely have voted against Gbagbo. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office through delaying six successive elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The individuals being prosecuted include senior politicians and civil servants. Kenyan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7068055.stm">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [BBC profile] announced Thursday his opposition to leaving the ICC, stating that the trials will take take place at The Hague.

<p>Earlier this month, the ICC prosecutor announced that Kenya's threats would <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-kenya-threats-will-not-stop-election-violence-prosecutions.php">not prevent the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of the six suspects responsible for Kenya's 2007 post-election violence.

Miller claimed that errors in the counting of election ballots and voter registration led to the write-in victory of his rival Senator <a href="http://lisamurkowski.com/main/">Lisa Murkowski</a> [campaign website]. Affirming a lower court decision, the Supreme Court held that abbreviations, misspellings or other variations in the write-in candidate's name is allowed as long as the voter's intention can be ascertained:
<blockquote>Joe Miller seeks an interpretation of election statute AS 15.15.360 that would disqualify any write-in votes that misspell the candidate's name. We do not interpret the statute to require perfection in the manner that the candidate's name is written on the ballot. Our prior decisions clearly hold that a voter's intention is paramount.</blockquote> The Supreme Court gave Miller until Monday to decide on whether he will back Murkowski or pursue the claim in federal court. Members of Congress will be sworn in when the new term begins January 5.

<p>The lawsuit follows the close 2010 midterm election results between Senate incumbent Lisa Murkowski and Republican candidate Joe Miller. According to the <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/">State of Alaska Division of Elections</a> [official website], Murkowski <a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/10GENR/data/results.pdf">leads</a> [unofficial results] with over 100,000 write-in votes in comparison to 90,740 votes for Miller. Earlier this month, Superior Court Judge William B. Carey upheld the division of election's actions, striking down Miller's challenge to the election results. In November, a federal judge <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/west/view/20101213joe_miller_appeals_decision_in_alaska_senate_race/">halted certification</a> [AP report] of the election results pending the Supreme Court's decision.<br />

Freedom House commended U.S. <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> and <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showpage.aspx?id=1847&lang=en">European High Representative Catherine Ashton</a> [official websites] for their <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/12/153661.htm">joint statement</a> [text] calling on Belarusian authorities to release imprisoned presidential candidates and election protesters, and condemning all violence in the aftermath of last week's elections. Freedom House Executive Director David J. Kramer urged further action, stating that<blockquote>[w]hile today's strong statement from foreign policy leaders in the United States and Europe is encouraging, both should be prepared to take further concrete action should conditions in Minsk not change dramatically and immediately. ... If the government of Belarus fails to take fully restorative action in the next two weeks, the European Union should renew full sanctions against the Lukashenka regime, which had been suspended in 2008.  The current situation is much worse than that in 2006, when the E.U. and U.S. together imposed sanctions against the regime.</blockquote> Freedom House is pressing for trans-Atlantic solidarity in taking action for this week's post-election controversy in Belarus.

<p>Last week, Belarus conducted a presidential election that critics allege did not meet international standards. On Monday, Belarusian police <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">arrested hundreds of demonstrators</a> [JURIST report], including seven of the nine presidential candidates, who were protesting the results of Sunday's presidential election. The official results declared incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>] the winner of the presidency for a fourth term. Hundreds of <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] has historically <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136021.htm">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [2009 report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">report</a>].

After six years of investigation, Swiss federal magistrate Andreas Mueller <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swiss-men-with-cia-links-face-nuclear-secrets-trial-2168248.html">recommended</a> [<em>The Independent</em> report] that the three engineers be tried for providing weapons-related technology to a Pakistani smuggling ring run by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3343621.stm">Abdul Qadeer Khan</a> [BBC profile]. Brothers Urs and Marco Tinner, along with their father Friedrich, were arrested in 2004 on suspicion of smuggling, but were eventually released. The Tinners said that had been informants for the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">CIA</a> [official website] since 2003. Khan has confessed to giving nuclear technology to Iran and Libya.

<p>In September, an American scientist and his wife were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-scientist-charged-with-conspiracy-to-sell-nuclear-data-to-venezuela.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] for conspiring to sell nuclear weapons information to an individual they believed worked for the Venezuelan government. Pedro Leonardo Mascheroni and his wife, Marjorie Mascheroni, were arrested by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> [official website] and appeared before the US District Court for the District of New Mexico. The defendants used to work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and possessed classified nuclear weapons knowledge. According to the indictment, between March 2008 and August 2009, Pedro Mascheroni, who is a naturalized US citizen, negotiated a deal with an undercover FBI agent he believed to be a Venezuelan official in which he would help the country develop a nuclear weapon in exchange for over $700,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The New START treaty replaces the expired <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> [materials], with Russia and the US each pledging to reduce their countries' nuclear warheads by about 30 percent. Under the terms of the treaty and its protocol, both countries would only be allowed to deploy 1,550 strategic warheads, a decrease from the 2,200 currently permitted. Russian experts call the treaty <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-mem-fg-russia-new-start-m,0,4604947.story">the most significant development in modern US-Russian relations</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report]. The government will likely approve treaty in full this January.

<p>On Wednesday, the US <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-ratifies-russia-nuclear-arms-treaty.php">voted 71-26</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the treaty. US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague in April. The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sen was convicted under the <a href="http://cpjc.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/cspsa_english.pdf">Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act of 2005</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/the_unlawful_activities__amendord2004.htm">Unlawful Activities Prevention Act of 2004</a> [text] for involvement with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12773/terror_groups_in_india.html#p4">Naxalite Maoist rebellion</a> [CFR backgrounder].

Verma, both of which are punishable by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive]. The two other defendants were Piyush Guha and Narayan Sanyal, whom prosecutors said aided Sen. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called the charges <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/indian-doctor-binayak-sens-conviction-and-life-sentence-mock-justice-2010-12-25">"politically motivated"</a> [press release] and called for them to be immediately dropped, saying<blockquote>Life in prison is an unusually harsh sentence for anyone, much less for an internationally recognized human rights defender who has never been charged with any act of violence. ... Dr Sen, who is considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, was convicted under laws that are impermissibly vague and fall well short of international standards for criminal prosecution. ... [A]uthorities in Chhattisgarh should be acting to protect the people of the region from the abuses committed by the Maoists, as well as state security forces and militias.</blockquote>AI also criticized the conduct of the trial, which lasted over three years due to repeated delays. Sen, who had been free on bail since May 2009, was <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Amnesty-International-slams-Binayak-Sens-life-term/articleshow/7162267.cms">taken into custody</a> [TOI report] following the ruling.

<p>The Indian government has faced both international and domestic criticism for its anti-terror laws. In 2008, AI urged Indian <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/press_releases2008.html">President Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/rights-group-urges-india-president-to.php">reject</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://164.100.47.4/Bios_Search/Bill_texts_pre.aspx?Bill_ID=3230&House=Lok%20Sabha">Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment of 2008</a> (UAPA) [legislative materials], which allows the government to hold terrorism suspects for up to 180 days.

In 2006, the opposition <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP) [party website], alleged that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm">Mumbai train bombings</a> [BBC report] were <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-government-urged-to-revive.php">"a fallout of repealing"</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/POTA.htm">Prevention of Terrorism Act</a> (POTA) [text], set aside by the incumbent United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in 2004. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] on Friday urged incumbent Ivory Coast president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] to step down, threatening the use of force if he attempts to maintain power. Gbagbo has refused to cede power to president-elect <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Alassance Ouattara</a> [BBC profile], who won the November 28 runoff electio,n according to international observers. Gbagbo's supporters have allegedly been engaging in violence and intimidation against opponents, which has <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-council-condemns-ivory-coast-post-election-violence.php">resulted in more that 170 deaths</a> [JURIST report], hundreds of arrests and the use of torture, ill treatment and forced disappearances, according to UN human rights officials. Gbagbo has faced multiple threats and sanctions levied by both the regional and international communities, including travel bans and freezes on financial assets, in addition to personal pleas from neighboring heads of state. Despite this, Gbagbo has refused to step down, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12077298">describing actions against his government as illegal</a> [BBC report] and rejecting the possibility of a power sharing agreement modeled on those created after the disputed elections in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election">Kenya</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+election">Zimbabwe</a> [JURIST news archives]. ECOWAS is also <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/West+African+bloc+sending+three+presidents+Coast/4025446/story.html">expected to send a delegation</a> [<em>Montreal Gazette</em> report] of the presidents of Benin, Sierra Leone and Cape Verde to meet with Gbagbo hoping to convince him to make a peaceful exit so as not to have to depend on forced removal. 

<p>On Thursday, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted a resolution condemning the post-election violence. Also Thursday, Ouattara's prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] called on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to launch an investigation into possible crimes being committed by Gbagbo's supporters. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.aspx?id=&lang=en">Council of the EU</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/eu-adopts-sanctions-against-ivory-coast-over-non-compliance-with-election-results.php">adopted a decision instituting sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against the Ivory Coast. There has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-urges-calm-following-ivory-coast-election.php">unrest in the country</a> [JURIST report] since elections were held at the beginning of this month. The UN certified Ouattrara's victory, despite a ruling by the Ivorian Constitutional Council in Gbagbo's favor. Both have taken oaths of office. Approximately $340 million in aid from the EU could also be withheld if Gbagbo does not concede victory to Ouattrara.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During the post-election violence in the Ivory Coast hundreds have been arrested and dozens have been subjected to torture, ill treatment and forced disappearances. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Alassane Ouattara</a> defeated incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profiles] in a November 28 runoff election, but Gbagbo has refused to concede victory, and his supporters have been engaging in a campaign of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/23/AR2010122302954.html">violence and intimidation</a> [WP report].

Latifi, a law student, was arrested in 2007 and sentenced to death by hanging for his role in an attack on a police station and an attempted assassination of a prosecutor on behalf of the <a href="http://pjak.org/english.php">Kurdish Independent Life Party</a> (PJAK) [official website]. Latifi was charged with the national security-related charge of mohareb, translated as being "enemies of God." On Friday, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called on Iran to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/clemency-call-kurdish-law-student-facing-execution-iran-2010-12-24)">halt the execution</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/12/24/iran-rescind-execution-order-kurdish-student">release</a> [press releases] Latifi. In its statement, HRW called Latifi&#8217;s conviction unfair and criticized the charges against him:<blockquote>Latifi is one of at least 16 Kurds facing execution on various national security-related charges including moharebeh. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases where Iranian security forces have used physical and psychological coercion including torture to secure confessions in security-related cases, and courts have convicted defendants of moharebeh in trials where prosecutors failed to provide any convincing evidence establishing the defendant's guilt.</blockquote>The Iranian government has not officially commented on the status of Latifi&#8217;s execution.

<p>The <a href="http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/accueil/">World Coalition Against the Death Penalty</a> in October marked the 8th World Day against the <a href="http://www.worldcoalition.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=389">Death Penalty</a> [advocacy websites], specifically urging the US, Iran and China to end the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/international-protests-urge-abolishment-of-the-death-penalty.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. Despite the continued use of the death penalty in some countries, there is a growing movement toward international abolition. Earlier this year AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] the number of countries using the death penalty <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">dropped</a> [report, PDF] in 2009. According to the report, more than 700 people were executed last year in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the US. More than two-thirds of the world's countries have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three judge panel of the appeals court <a href="http://www.dailylocal.com/articles/2010/12/25/news/srv0000010387985.txt">allowed the admission</a> [<em>Daily Local News</em> report] of evidence that could bring four more alleged burglaries to light. In 2008, GPS tracking devices had been placed in SUVs thought to be used in the commission of several burglaries around Philadelphia. The GPS devices later showed the SUVs at or near the scene of further crimes. Chester County Judge Thomas Gavin originally upheld the movement to suppress the evidence obtained by GPS citing a lack of case history and unease with the invasion of privacy such technology allowed.

<p>The use of GPS technology by police has been a controversial issue in the US recently. In November, the US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-ruling-against-warrantless-gps-tracking-to-stand.php">declined to rehear en banc</a> [JURIST report] a bid by the US Department of Justice to overturn a decision that prevents the government from using GPS technology to track suspects without a warrant. However, courts have struggled with how to apply Fourth Amendment protections to modern technology.  In September, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that at times the government might <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">need a warrant to obtain cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. In June, the US Supreme Court unanimously <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an employer's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">search of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Khodorkovsky, the former owner of Yukos oil, and Lebedev were charged and convicted of embezzling 218 million tons of oil from Yukos between 1998 and 2003 and <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101227/wl_afp/russiapoliticstrialrights">laundering over $27 billion</a> [AFP report] in proceeds. Defense counsel pointed out inconsistent facts found at trial and criticized the ruling in a <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">statement</a> [text]:<blockquote>[T]he judge blocked [defense] lawyers from introducing exculpatory documentary evidence and refused to hear many witnesses and experts. An illusion of adversarial nature and legitimacy was created by allowing the defense to file motions and objections to serious procedural violations, however [they were] routinely quashed. ... [T]he court ... openly ignore[d] applicable procedural and substantive laws as well as basic notions of fairness. This is testament to the power of those corrupt officials who zealously seek to justify their seizure, control and ownership of Yukos assets and to isolate Khodorkovsky and Lebedev from Russia's business and public spheres - and to keep them in jail as long as possible to achieve these goals.</blockquote>Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are currently serving eight-year prison sentences after being <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">convicted on fraud and tax evasion charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 stemming from attempts to embezzle valuable assets from Yukos. Prosecutors are seeking a six-year prison term for Khodorkovsky, but a <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/khodorkovsky-found-guilty/427879.html">sentence will not be handed down</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] until Judge Viktor Danilkin finishes reading the 250-page verdict.

<p>The trial has not proceeded without considerable political conflict. In May, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href=""/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky's opposition to Putin. In March, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement comes almost one year after the Obama administration missed its <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">self-imposed January 2010 deadline</a> [JURIST report] to close the facility. Gibbs also stated that in addition to the use of civilian courts and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive], some detainees would have to be indefinitely detained:<blockquote>[T]here are prohibitions legislatively on the transfer of some of the prisoners that are there into some part of this country, some would be tried in federal courts as we've seen done in the past, some would be tried in military commissions, likely spending the rest of their lives in a maximum security prison that nobody, including terrorists, have ever escaped from and some regrettably will have to be indefinitely detained, I say regrettably not because it's a bad thing necessarily for them in terms of the fact that they're very dangerous people and we have to make sure that even if we can't prosecute them, we're not putting them back out on the battlefield.</blockquote>Gibbs emphasized that the future of Guantanamo Bay hinges on Republican cooperation to close the prison, which would be in the interests of national security, according to Gibbs, due to the facility's use as a recruiting tool by <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9126/alqaeda_aka_alqaida_alqaida.html">al Qaeda</a> [CFR backgrounder].

<p>The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including strong opposition from members of Congress. Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-approves-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">voted 212-206 in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.03082:">defense spending bill</a> [HR 3082 materials] including a provision preventing Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for trial.

The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101227/ap_on_re_eu/eu_britain_terror;_ylt=A0wNdPm38xhNG_4AMj534T0D">charges come after</a> [AP report] British authorities had apprehended 12 men on December 21 as part of raids to capture suspected terrorists. Four of the men charged are from Stoke-on-Trent, three are from Cardiff, and two more are from London. Three were released uncharged. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12081828">men are being charged</a> [BBC report] with conspiring to cause an explosion and for engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts under <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2321013">5(1) of the British Terrorism Act of 2006</a> [text].

British Security officials stated that the plots were not planned for over the holidays and were not connected to any larger European terror plots. The men will appear before England's <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/HMCSCourtFinder/Search.do;jsessionid=14A3FBA8C74A8E568313A7F7BF214680">Central Criminal Court</a> [official website] in London on January 14.

The tribunal brings doubt over the legitimacy of the elections which have already been tainted by irregularities that forced authorities to invalidate a significant number of votes and disqualify candidates. The decision comes less than a month before the 249-seat parliament is set to convene on January 20 but officials say Karzai is committed to inaugurating the parliament by then. The Supreme Court had initially suggested the tribunal after receiving a flood of complaints passed on by the <a href="http://www.ago.gov.af/">Attorney General Office</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website], however, claims that no one has the authority to overturn the results of the election once it has certified them. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BQ0W420101227">tribunal will consist</a> [Reuters report] of a five-judge panel that will review all issues with the election including allegations of criminal fraud and intimidation at the polls.  

<p>The September parliamentary elections irregularities raise doubt over the ability of the Afghanistan government to lead. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website]<a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php"> disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the IEC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures. The 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] of Karzai was also marred by fraud allegations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

AI claimed that prosecutors failed to provide due process for Khodorkovsky by refusing to allow Khodorkovsky to cross-examine witnesses, harassing and pressuring former colleagues to testify against Khodorkovsky and failing to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense team. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/index.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] also <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">criticized the process</a> [press release], saying that Monday's verdict "raises serious questions about selective prosecution -- and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations. This and similar cases have a negative impact on Russia's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate." German <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/AAmt/Leitung/BM-Westerwelle_node.html">Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle</a> [official profile] also criticized the verdict, <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Meldungen/2010/101227-Chodorowskij.html">stating</a> [press release]: <blockquote>I am greatly concerned that Mikhail Khordorkovsky and Platon Lebedev have once again been found guilty. The circumstances of the trial were most unsatisfactory and a setback for the modernization to which the country aspires. It is in the interest of our Russian partners to take these concerns seriously and firmly uphold the rule of law, democracy and human rights.</blockquote>  A spokesperson for Russia's <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">rebuffed criticism from foreign governments</a> [press release, in Russian; <em>RIA Novosti</em> <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20101228/161965413.html">report</a>], declaring "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable." Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are currently serving eight-year prison sentences after being <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">convicted on fraud and tax evasion charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 stemming from attempts to embezzle valuable assets from Yukos. Prosecutors are seeking a six-year prison term for Khodorkovsky, but a sentence <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/khodorkovsky-found-guilty/427879.html">will not be handed down</a> [Moscow Times report] until Judge Viktor Danilkin finishes reading the 250-page verdict.

<p>The trial has not proceeded without considerable political conflict. In May, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky's opposition to Putin. In March, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The company will pay $92 million as part of a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the criminal charges filed today by the DOJ in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website]. The charges consist of one count of "violating the internal control provisions" of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a> (FCPA) [materials] and one count of "violating the books and records provisions" of the FCPA. Additionally, the DOJ filed charges against three of the company's subsidiaries for "conspiring to violate the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions" of the FCPA. The subsidiaries have agreed to plead guilty to these charges.  According to the DOJ statement, the company and its subsidiaries made improper payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain contracts for business in Costa Rica, Honduras, Malaysia and Taiwan and also violated FCPA regulations by hiring third-party sales and marketing agents. The company profited more than $48 million dollars from these transactions. As part of the settlement, Alcatel-Lucent agreed to enhance their compliance procedures, retain an independent compliance monitor for three years, and submit yearly reports to the DOJ. In a separate settlement with the SEC, the company consented to a permanent injunction against FCPA violations and agreed to pay more than $45 million to resolve the matter. Alcatel-Lucent <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4x3tXDUL8h2VAQAURh_Yw!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_2010/News_Article_002305.xml">released a statement</a> [text] welcoming the settlements and announcing procedures to prevent such violations from occurring in the future.

<p>Alcatel committed these violations prior to merging with Lucent Technologies in December 2006. Lucent has fought its own legal battles relating to patent infringement. In 2003, Lucent filed 15 patent claims alleging that PC makers violated patents governing digit music technology developed by its research and development organization, <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Laboratories</a> [corporate website].  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate website] joined the litigation as an intervenor and counter-claimant, due to its wide circulation of Windows Media Player through its Windows operating system. Claims were also filed against <a href="http://www.gateway.com/">Gateway</a> and <a href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> [corporate websites].  In February 2007, a federal jury in California found that Microsoft violated two patents and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-jury-orders-microsoft-to-pay.php">awarded Alcatel-Lucent $1.52 billion in damages</a> [JURIST report]. One week later, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/judge-dismisses-second-microsoft-patent.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Alcatel-Lucent's second patent infringement suit filed against Microsoft concerning patents related to speech recognition technology.  In August 2007, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-judge-overturns-152b-verdict.php">overturned the $1.52 billion jury decision</a> [JURIST report], ruling that the verdict "was against the clear weight of the evidence." The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-circuit-rules-against-lucent-in.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the decision in 2008.<br />

The SEC's complaint, filed last week in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], alleges that the <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-12-27/business/bs-bz-martek-sec-trading-20101227_1_martek-suspicious-trading-scott-friestad">investors bought 2,615 Martek call options</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] between December 10 and 15 and sold the options on December 21, the day on which the previously non-disclosed deal was announced. DSM paid a 35 percent premium over Martek's December 20 closing price in the deal, allowing the investors to make $1.2 million according to the SEC. To prevail on the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm">insider trading</a> [SEC backgrounder] claims, the SEC must show that the defendants purchased the call options on the basis of material nonpublic information. The court <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-28/sec-accuses-martek-investors-of-insider-trading.html">agreed to freeze assets from the sale</a> [AP report] on December 23 and scheduled a hearing for January 6.

<p>Recent years have seen an increase in insider trading cases. Last week it was announced that Karl Motey, a cooperating witness in a large insider trading probe, had <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-23/consultant-motey-to-plead-guilty-detail-marvell-tips-in-u-s-insider-case.html">pleaded guilty</a> [Bloomberg report] earlier in the month to conspiracy and securities fraud. Earlier this month authorities arrested executives from <a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, <a href="http://www.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDHomePage.aspx">Advanced Micro Devices</a> (AMD), <a href="http://www.flextronics.com/">Flextronics</a> and <a href="http://www.tsmc.com/english/default.htm">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</a> [corporate websites] on <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374445,00.asp">insider trading charges</a> [<em>PC Mag</em> report] in part of the same probe that snared Motey. The probe <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1623594620101216">involves expert networks</a> [Reuters report] that facilitate conversations between insiders and investors and whether or not these conversations led to the disclosure of confidential information. In September, a judge sentenced former <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> [corporate website] senior vice president Robert Moffat to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the largest insider trading trading case in US history. Moffat's conviction was part of the government's investigation into Galleon Group hedge fund founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive], who <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges last December. Prosecutors claim that Rajaratnam and others at Galleon Group solicited nonpublic information from insiders at other companies. Former Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/ex-qwest-ceo-nacchio-begins-serving.php">began serving a 6-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] for insider trading in April 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling was a landmark decision in immigration proceedings as, unlike criminal courts, immigration courts are not required to provide defense attorneys to indigent defendants. Judge Dolly Gee of the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] held last week that the men are entitled to representation, but stated that the representative <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_16933454?nclick_check=1">does not have to be an attorney</a> [Mercury News report].  The decision stemmed from a <a href="http://www.aclu-sc.org/releases/view/103016">lawsuit</a> [materials] filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu-sc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California</a> [advocacy website] arguing that the two men, Jose Franco-Gonzales and Guillermo Gomez-Sanchez, were deprived of their right to due process when they were declared unfit to face immigration proceedings and detained by immigration officials rather than released to their families until the situation was resolved.  Although the action was originally filed on behalf of the two men, the court granted a petition to <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/us-must-provide-disabled-illegal-immigrants-with-lawyers-judge-rules.html">transform it into a class-action suit</a> [LA Times report].  Franco-Gonzalez suffers from severe cognitive disabilities and Gomez-Sanchez was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Judge Gee released the two men on bail in April, but they are still facing possible deportation.

<p>In October, the ICE and the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">US Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] announced that US government has <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-announces-record-number-of-deportations-in-2010.php">deported a record number of illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST report] in 2010.  The agencies reported that more than 390,000 illegal immigrants were deported and that half of those deported allegedly had criminal records.  In July, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-immigration-caseloads-spike-amid-government-crackdown.php">a study released by Syracuse University</a> [JURIST report] indicated that backlogs at US immigration courts had increased by more than 30 percent in the previous 18 months.  This rise has been attributed to the Obama Administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-government-increasing-enforcement-of-immigration-laws-report.php">increasing enforcement of immigration laws</a> [JURIST report].  Federal authorities have indicated that the workload would continue to grow if Arizona's recent <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] is implemented. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. The constitutionality of the law has been widely disputed, and the legislation is now facing several lawsuits, including a suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed by the US Department of Justice</a> [JURIST report].  In October, a judge for the<a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/"> US District Court in the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-suit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report]  motions to dismiss a class action lawsuit challenging the law's constitutionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report recognizes that corruption remains a concern and states the aims of the Chinese government are to build a perfect system of punishment and prevention of corruption with more resolutions and powerful measures aimed at winning the people's confidence.  The ruling party of China, the <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [official website], has also issued codes of conduct prohibiting party members from using their powers to seek illegitimate gains.  Supervisory and auditing authorities will play a critical role in China's plans to tackle corruption, with the report stating that:
<blockquote>By promoting the principle of transparency in power exercise and the system of supervisors for building a clean government, the personnel for law and discipline enforcement have been encouraged to foster the sense of conscientious acceptance of supervision from all quarters, so as to constantly improve their capabilities and levels in law and discipline enforcement, thus providing the organizational guarantee for China's endeavor to combat corruption and build a clean government.</blockquote>
The report highlights regulations which require party officials to disclose their incomes and investments and require officials to register gifts they have received.  In addition, the report touts revision of the country's criminal laws to include embezzlement, bribery, dereliction of duty and holding property with an unidentified source. The report favorably recognizes the role of news media and the Internet in uncovering corruption in China and increasing transparency.  Anti-corruption education is also identified as a critical tool in building a cleaner government.  

<p>The report is a continuation of the Chinese government's on-going battle against what is perceived to be  <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">pervasive corruption</a> [JURIST news archive] in official channels.  In July, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed a top judicial official</a> [JURIST report] after a corruption probe in the southwestern city of Chongquing revealed he had taken nearly $2 million in bribes and had been protecting a number of organized crime gangs. In March, the Hebei Province People's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld a life sentence</a> for the former vice president of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC), Huang Songyou, who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, SPC president Wang Shengjun <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">called for increased efforts to fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country's court system. In January, the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">announced new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/microsoft-co-founder-sues-11-major-web-companies-over-patents.php">original lawsuit </a> was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-microsoft-co-founders-patent-suit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this month for vagueness by a judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website]. The amended complaint <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20026733-38.html">identifies over 40 products and devices</a> [CNet Report], such as Google Desktop, Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [corporate websites] alerts, that allegedly infringe upon Allen's four patents. The eight other corporations named in the complaint include <a href="http://www.corp.aol.com/">AOL</a>, Facebook, <a href="http://ir.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, <a href="http://www.officedepot.com/specialLinks.do?file=/companyinfo/companyfacts/index.jsp&template=companyinfo">Office Depot</a>, <a href="http://about.officemax.com/html/officemax_who_we_are.shtml">Office Max</a>, <a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/about_us/index.html">Staples</a>, <a href="http://info.yahoo.com/center/us/yahoo/">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/about">YouTube</a> [corporate websites]. The suit alleges that the defendants infringed on a patent that <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F6757682">recommends like content to users based on real-time viewing data</a>, while all but Facebook violated another that <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F6263507">amalgamates and analyzes audio, video and text data</a> [USPTO materials] to perform a similar function.

<p>Allen's suit comes as several of the named defendants face unrelated litigation alleging misappropriation of intellectual property. Connecticut company XPRT Ventures LLC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ebay-sued-for-38-billion-in-patent-infringement-case.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] eBay in July claiming the infringement of six patents for online auctions and payment systems. In April, a federal appeals court found that eBay is <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-ebay-has-no.php">not required to actively monitor its website</a> [JURIST report] for the sale of counterfeit goods. The ruling came shortly after a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-rules-ebay-intentionally.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the company to pay <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [official website] damages for paying search engines to direct consumers to counterfeit LVMH products. LVMH previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">secured a $63 million judgment</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods that infringed on registered designs. Patent holding company NTP <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ntp-sues-apple-for-alleged-patent-infringement.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in July against Apple and Google, among other smart phone makers, related to the use of e-mail systems utilizing technology patented by NTP. The US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] launched an investigation in June into allegations by <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=0">HTC Corp</a> [corporate website] accusing Apple of patent infringement on certain portable electronic devices. In October 2009, Finnish telecommunications company <a href="http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/nokia-sues-apple-alleging-iphone-patent.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Apple alleging that the company infringed 10 of its patents since the first iPhone was released in 2007. The patents cover wireless data transmission, speech coding and security/encryption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nazarbayev's current term is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hC0UZaZYP61Wl02Dqvs2siKnjthA?docId=CNG.c0a719d0daf7352ff943520a2d71d930.a1">set to expire in 2012</a> [AP report]. If he continues to rule until 2020, Nazarbayev will have been in power in the country for 30 years. Supporters of the referendum <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=expert_opinions&news_id=248">maintain that it is necessary</a> [Interfax report] in order to ensure that Nazarbayev can continue to address issues facing the country. They also indicated that continuity of government is necessary for the country's continued growth. Opposition parties to the referendum claim Nazarbayev's political party is attempting to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE6BS0B120101229?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">eliminate any political competition</a> [Reuters report]. The referendum will reportedly take place <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=expert_opinions&news_id=250">as early as March 2011</a>.

<p>In June, Nazarbayev announced during a local TV broadcast that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kazakhstan-president-declines-to-sign-bill-extending-powers.php">would not sign a controversial law</a> [JURIST report] that would grant him several presidential powers for life, even if he stepped down from office. Nazarbayev's supporters believed that the president has earned such protections due to his ability as a nation builder. Opponents had urged the president not to sign the bill. The draft law moved quickly through Kazakhstan's parliament in May, with the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kazakhstan-approves-constitutional-amendments-to-increase-presidential-powers.php">upper</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kazakhstan-lower-house-approves-bill-to-increase-presidents-power.php">lower houses</a> [JURIST reports] approving the bill in under a week. The amendment has been criticized both internationally and domestically with opponents accusing Nazarbayev's supporters of trying to install a constitutional monarchy. In 2007, Nazarbayev <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/kazakhstan-president-approves.php">approved a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] removing term limits on his own presidency, effectively allowing him to remain president for life. Under the amendment, subsequent presidents will have to abide by the law limiting them to two terms in office. The amendment also reduced presidential terms from 7 years to 5. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the letter sent by Polish prosecutors to the Helsinki Foundation, the US government <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j59Y9-IxED2Ahs88K04UXfGsnM9w?docId=CNG.2e713223f5495d096b581fa47878429b.301">denied the March 2009 request</a> [AFP report] on the basis of a bilateral agreement on the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101228/ap_on_re_eu/eu_poland_cia_prison#">protection of state interests</a> [AP report]. Polish prosecutors granted al-Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/poland-prosecutors-grant-terror-suspect-victim-status.php">victim status</a> [JURIST report] in October, recognizing validity of his claims that he was mistreated by interrogators.  Al-Nashiri remains a detainee at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], despite an announcement last month by the Obama administration that charges against him are <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-administration-not-bringing-charges-against-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-wp.php">not pending</a> [JURIST report] or being considered. The Pentagon <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/military-commissions-overseer-orders.php">formally dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against al-Nashiri in February 2009, effectively ending his prosecution under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF].

<p>Polish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">opened an investigation</a> into the alleged mistreatment of al-Nashiri in September in response to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/lawyers-for-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-request-investigation-into-detention-in-poland.php">request</a> [JURIST reports] filed by human rights group <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] and al-Nashiri's lawyers. OSJI stated that the filing represents the first attempt by an <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] victim to pursue a legal remedy within the Polish court system. The commencement of the investigation came one week after former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge</a> [JURIST report] of a secret CIA prison in Poland and indicated that he would not discuss allegations of torture until the Polish government's investigation is complete. Earlier this month, lawyers for Guantanamo detainee Abu Zubaydah <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/guantanamo-detainee-asks-poland-to-probe-alleged-cia-secret-prison.php">asked Polish prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate claims that Zubaydah was abused in the secret CIA prison, hoping Zubaydah's investigation would be done in conjunction with al-Nashiri's investigation. Allegations against Poland were first raised in a June 2007 <a href="http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11302.htm">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/cia-operated-secret-prisons-in-poland.php">report</a>] to the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] by Swiss Senator Dick Marty. The report concluded that numerous European governments had cooperated with the CIA secret prison program. In February 2007, the European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/eu-parliament-condemns-member-states.php">condemned more than a dozen European states</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the program. Several nations have been accused of obstructing European probes into the secret prison allegations, <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/europe-lawmaker-accuses-poland-of.php">including Poland</a> [JURIST report], which allegedly housed the <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/poland-had-main-cia-prison-in-europe.php">largest CIA detention facility in Europe</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former Israeli <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6054502.stm">President Moshe Katsav</a> [BBC profile] was convicted of two rape charges on Thursday, following his decision to rescind an earlier plea bargain. A Tel Aviv court found him guilty of assaulting a female employee of the Tourism Ministry during his time as Minister, and two women at the President's Residence during his time as President. Katsav resigned his position as President in 2007 due to the sexual assault allegations. The <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/heb/cv/fe_html_out/courts/details/310.htm">Tel Aviv District Court</a> [official website, in Hebrew] found that Katsav's defense was "<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/katsav-lied-manipulated-and-withheld-information-1.334311">riddled with lies</a>" [Haaretz report], including edited tapes of the women's testimony and falsely prepared datebooks. Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] said that the ruling sent <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/12/30/israel.katsav.verdict/index.html?hpt=T2">two clear messages</a> [CNN report] "about the equality of all before the law and about a woman's right concerning her own body." The conviction ends a four-year legal battle that has Katsav facing between 4 and 16 years in prison. Lead attorney Avigdor Feldman said that Katsav <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4006782,00.html">plans to appeal</a> [Ynet report] the ruling to the <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website, in Hebrew]. 

<p>Katsav was initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-indicted-on-rape.php">indicted on rape charges </a>[JURIST report] in 2009 for allegedly assaulting female employees in the 1990's.

The imposition of the maximum possible sentence has <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14744106,00.html">stoked international criticism</a> [<em>Deutsche Welle</em> report] of what has been viewed by many as a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/russia-must-overturn-unfair-conviction-businessman-2010-12-27">politically-motivated abuse of the law</a> [AI report] orchestrated by the men's enemies in the Kremlin.  <a href="http://www.state.gov">U.S. State Department</a> [official website] representative Mark Toner expressed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWBT01430920101230">continued concern</a> [Reuters report] over apparent abuses of due process in Khodorkovsky's trial, particularly in light of the severity of the verdict. Russian human rights activist Lev Ponomarev, head of the <a href="http://zaprava.ru">All Russia Movement for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website, in Russian], <a href="http://zaprava.ru/201012302643/glavnyie-novosti-dnya/novogodnee-pozdravlenie-lva-ponomareva-edinomyshlennikam">called</a> [press release, in Russian] the sentence "monstrous and farcical ... shatter[ing] faith in judicial reform and the possibility of an evolutionary transition to the rule of law."  Critics have characterized the entire trial as <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] retaliation for Khodorkovsky's opposition to Russian prime minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>].

<p>Khodorkovsky, the former owner of Yukos oil, and Lebedev, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101227/wl_afp/russiapoliticstrialrights">embezzling more than $27 billion</a> [AFP report] from the company.  Their defense counsel staunchly criticized the ruling, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission.  The verdict drew vehement <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official biograpy], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution."  The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable."  The men are currently serving eight-year prison sentences for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], to which they were sentenced in 2005 for the same money laundering from Yukos.  In May, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. In March, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">the fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Deng called allegations that the homes of Gbagbo's political opponents have been marked with their occupants' ethnicity "extremely worrying." Also on Thursday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said that he was <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sgsm13334.doc.htm">deeply alarmed</a> [press release] by reports that one of Gbagbo's supporters has ordered a sympathetic youth political movement, the <a href="http://www.cojep.info/">Young Patriots</a> [advocacy website, in French] to attack the hotel where <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/">UN Ivory Coast Operation</a> (UNOCI) [official website] peacekeepers are guarding president-elect Ouattara, on January 1.  A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Office of the Secretary General</a> [official website], Martin Nesirky, affirmed the UNOCI's willingness to "use all necessary means" to enforce international law:<blockquote>The Secretary General remains very concerned about the deteriorating situation in the Ivory Coast.... The Secretary General wishes to warn that any attack against peacekeepers constitutes a crime under international law, for which the perpetrators and those who instigate them will be held accountable.  Any attack on the Golf Hotel could provoke widespread violence that could reignite civil war. The Secretary General calls on all those who may be contemplating participation in the attack to refrain from such dangerous and irresponsible action.</blockquote>
Youssoufou Bamba, Ouattara's newly appointed ambassador to the UN characterized the West African nation as being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BT14U20101230">on the brink of genocide</a> [Reuters report].

<p>During the post-election violence in the Ivory Coast, hundreds have been arrested and dozens have allegedly been subjected to torture, ill treatment and forced disappearances.  Last week, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/4d1634909.html">expressed concern</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-agency-reports-thousands-of-ivory-coast-refugees-fleeing-to-liberia.php">report</a>] over the humanitarian needs of nearly 14,000 Ivory Coast refugees who have fled to Liberia over the past month due to post-election political instability and violence.  The UNHCR warned that food supplies and housing are running short as refugees are increasingly arriving malnourished and fighting disease. Ouattara defeated Gbagbo in a November 28 runoff election, but Gbagbo has refused to concede victory, his supporters have responded to his loss in the election with a campaign of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/23/AR2010122302954.html">violence and intimidation</a> [WP report].

Zeng Jinchun, a chief inspector for the ruling <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [official website] in the central province of Hunan, accepted bribes in return for mining contracts and job promotions over a decade, ending in 2006. In addition to his conviction on charges of bribery, Zeng was also found guilty of not being able to account for some of his assets. Zeng was <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-12/30/c_13671251.htm">sentenced to death</a> [Xinhua report] by the Intermediate People's Court of Changsha City in 2008 and he was executed by firing squad after an appeals court rejected his appeal and the <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People's Court</a> (SPC) [official website] approved the execution.  Zeng's execution came one day after Beijing officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-releases-anti-corruption-report.php">pledged to crack down on corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country.

<p>This execution  is a continuation of the Chinese government's on-going battle against what is perceived to be <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">pervasive corruption</a> [JURIST news archive] in official channels. In September, a member of the <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/">National People's Congress</a> [official website] announced that the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-not-considering-eliminating-death-penalty-for-corruption.php">never considered removing the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] as a punishment for corruption during the consideration of an amendment to the criminal code. In July, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed a top judicial official</a> [JURIST report] after a corruption probe in the southwestern city of Chongquing revealed he had taken nearly 2 million USD in bribes and had been protecting a number of organized crime gangs. In March, the Hebei Province People's High Court upheld a life sentence for former vice president of the SPC, Huang Songyou, who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, the SPC president called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">increased efforts to fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country's court system. In January, the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">announced new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new regulation effectively <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703909904576052133143777012.html">transfers licensing power</a> [WSJ report] from the state of Texas to the EPA. The petition argues: <blockquote>The Partial [State Implementation Plan] Disapproval is contrary to both the Clean Air Act and the fundamental principles of administrative law. Recognizing the proper role of the States, the Clean Air Act declares pollution prevention to be "the primary responsibility of States and local governments," and not the federal government. EPA rejects that approach and seeks to deprive Texas of its right to manage its air resources. The Partial SIP Disapproval is particularly pernicious because it unlawfully attempts to partially disapprove Texas' environmental laws in the face of the State's admirable track record of reducing pollution and improving air quality in the State. Instead, EPA seeks to federalize that power by imposing federal control and commandeering critical portions of Texas' emissions permitting program.</blockquote> Texas asked the court to <a href="https://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2010/123010motion_for_stay.pdf">stay implementation of the rule</a> [motion for stay, PDF] pending review of the rule. Texas is the only state that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/23emit.html?scp=1&sq=texas%20emissions&st=cse">has not agreed to implement</a> [NYT report] new greenhouse gas emissions rules. Also on Thursday, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/default.aspx">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7359770.html">denied a request by Texas</a> [AP report] to stay the implementation of the new rules regulating emissions.

<p>Earlier this month, California's <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">Air Resources Board</a> [official website] approved measures that will <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/california-regulators-approve-incentives-for-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions.php">provide incentives</a> [JURIST report] to companies and factories that decrease their greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov">Senate</a> [official website] defeated a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.Res.26:">resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">report</a>] aimed at limiting the ability of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] affirmed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act in its 2007 ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/05-1120">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">report</a>]. In its ruling, the court held that if the EPA could show a link between greenhouse gas emissions and public health and welfare, then the act gives it the power to regulate emissions. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">announced last December</a> [JURIST report] that it had found that greenhouse gases "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. The EPA first <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/epa-announces-proposed-findings-for.php">announced its proposed finding</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009 before undertaking a 60-day public comment period. Some have suggested that the EPA findings have allowed Congress to <a href="/hotline/2009/04/epa-greenhouse-gas-finding-allows.php">avoid the political fallout</a> [JURIST comment] that could come from passing tough climate legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1101973/1/.html">convictions</a> [<em>Channel News Asia</em> report] are among the first handed down to yellow shirts, though prosecutors did not charge any party leaders. Those convicted were involved in a <a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=5924">2008 attack</a> [TNA report] on the government-owned <a href="http://nbttv.prd.go.th/">National Broadcasting Service of Thailand</a> (NBT) [media website, in Thai] where they threatened employees and shut the station down for a few hours. The yellow shirts attacked the station as part of their protests against then-prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile], an ally former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">deposed in a 2006 coup</a> [JURIST report]. Yellow shirt opponents <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12092906">have criticized the government</a> [BBC report] for not prosecuting more yellow shirts for violence during the 2008 demonstrations. Last week, Thailand <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12047207">lifted a state of emergency</a> [BBC report] that had been in effect for eight months following protests by members of the <a href="http://www.uddthailand.com/">United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship</a> [party website, in Thai], known as red shirts, last spring.

<p>In September, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/thailand-court-convicts-yellow-shirts-of-slandering-ex-pm.php">convicted two former yellow shirt television personalities</a> [JURIST report] of defaming Thaksin by accusing him of insulting the monarchy. In August, red shirt leaders <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/thailand-anti-government-leaders-plead-not-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to inciting violence and threatening government officials during a week of violence in May. In June, the Thai government indicated it would study the possibility of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/thailand-court-charges-11-red-shirt-protest-leaders-with-terrorism.php">extending amnesty to red shirt protesters</a> [JURIST report] convicted of minor offenses in order to facilitate reconciliation within the country. The offer of amnesty would not be given to the protesters charged with terrorism but could be extended to the 27 red shirt protesters who were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-court-sentences-protesters-to-six-months-in-prison.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] for violating the emergency decree prohibiting political gatherings of more than five people. The protests <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-government-imposes-curfew-in-bangkok.php">came to an end</a> [JURIST report] in May when red shirt leaders surrendered to police, which led to rioting, arson and the imposition of a curfew to protect citizens of Bangkok and its surrounding areas. The red shirts are supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin. The yellow shirts <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/thailand-court-disbands-ruling-party.php">ended their protests in 2008</a> and released <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/thailand-pm-demotes-police-chief-as.php">two airports they had taken over</a> [JURIST reports] after Thailand's Constitutional Court ordered a dissolution of the ruling government and removed prime minister Somchai Wongsawat.</p>]]></content:encoded>
