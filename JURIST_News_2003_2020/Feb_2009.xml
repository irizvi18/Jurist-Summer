		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/HOME/tabid/53/Default.aspx">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/sierraleone.php">news archive</a>] prosecutor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/ABOUT/CourtOrganization/Prosecution/tabid/90/Default.aspx">Stephen Rapp</a>&nbsp;[official profile] said&nbsp;Monday that a verdict in the war crimes case against <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/CharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">former Liberian President Charles Taylor</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>] is expected in early 2010. Rapp said that the last of the prosecution&#39;s 91 witnesses was called last Friday and that the trial will likely remain in recess until April, when the defense will begin calling witnesses. Taylor has pleaded not guilty to all <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">11 counts</a> [indictment, PDF] of crimes against humanity, violations of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [materials], and other violations of international humanitarian law.<br /><br />Taylor is generally deemed responsible for leading and funding civil wars in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone. He has previously complained that his single court-appointed defense lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/taylor-boycotts-opening-arguments-in.php">unfairly outnumbered</a> [JURIST report] by the prosecution team. The criticism prompted the SCSL to add four people to Taylor&#39;s defense team and <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/taylor-allocated-100000-monthly-for.php">increase funding available to Taylor</a> [JURIST report] to approximately $100,000 per month, despite a UN report that concluded Taylor <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/taylor-not-indigent-defendant-un.php">may control millions of dollars</a> [JURIST report] held in bank accounts worldwide. It was later determined that Taylor held <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/taylor-held-5b-in-us-banks-during.php">$5 billion in two US banks</a> [JURIST report] during his presidency. His trial began in Sierra Leone, but has been <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/taylor-flown-to-hague-for-sierra-leone.php">moved to The Hague</a> [JURIST report] for security reasons. Last month, Taylor&#39;s son <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/son-of-liberia-ex-leader-taylor.php">was sentenced to 97 years</a> [JURIST report] in a US prison for committing torture in Liberia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australia&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSC/2009/21.html">sentenced</a> Algerian cleric [sentencing remarks] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4416712.stm">Abdul Nacer Benbrika</a> [BBC profile], also known as Abu Bakr, to at least 12 years in prison for his role in plotting large-scale terror attacks aimed at sporting venues and railway stations in Australia. Benrika received a prison sentence of 12 to 15 years after being <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/australia-cleric-convicted-of-terrorism.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24347558-661,00.html">charges</a> [charge list] of directing the activities of a terrorist organization, being a member of a terrorist organization, and possessing a compact disc connected with the preparation of a terrorist attack. In dismissing defense counsel&#39;s argument that Benbrika&#39;s leadership was tenuous, Justice Bernard Bongiorno wrote:<blockquote>His leadership may have been less than what would have been expected had he been a trained soldier or even a trained terrorist, and his and his followers&#8217; capacity to carry out a terrorist act may have been less than professional. They may never have got to the point of carrying out a terrorist act. But all of these considerations are of little moment. By its existence, its nature and its activities the organisation fostered and encouraged its members to engage in violent jihad &#8212; to perform a terrorist act. By its collection and circulation of terrorist material it prepared, however indirectly, the doing of a terrorist act. These constitute the substance of the criminality in this case.</blockquote>Six other men also <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/terror-cell-leader-jailed-for-15-years-20090203-7wuv.html">received prison sentences</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Age</font> report] of between four-and-a-half and seven-and-a-half years on Monday for their roles in the plot.<br /><br />Benbrika was one of six men convicted on terrorism charges in September 2008. Benbrika and 12 others were arrested after the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/">Australian Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/australian-senate-passes-amendment-to.php">passed emergency anti-terror legislation</a> [JURIST report] allowing authorities to prosecute suspects without connecting them to a specific threat. Opponents have criticized the expanded prosecutorial powers included in the legislation, arguing that they <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/10/12/australia-anti-terrorism-proposal-threatens-civil-liberties">threaten civil liberties</a> [HRW press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An official from the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] said Friday that the <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater Worldwide</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater+">news archive</a>] contract to protect American diplomats in Iraq will not be renewed when it expires in May. The State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/mideastdigest/115558.htm">has yet to make an official statement</a> [press briefing] but is expected to do so soon. The decision not to renew the contract was made after the Iraqi government invoked its rights last week under the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [full text; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">materials</a>] by <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/iraq-not-renewing-blackwater-operating.php">refusing to renew</a> [JURIST report] Blackwater&#39;s operating license. <br /><br />The decision by the Iraqi government was motivated in part by the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">alleged killing of 17 civilians by Blackwater guards</a> [JURIST report] in September 2007. In January 2009, five Blackwater guards <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/indicted-blackwater-guards-plead-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to manslaughter, attempted manslaughter, and weapons charges. A sixth guard <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/us-v-ridgeway.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [text, PDF] to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. In November, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian meat producer <a href="http://www.mapleleaf.ca/Aboutus/default.aspx">Maple Leaf Foods</a> [corporate website] announced Monday that it had reached a <a href="http://www.mapleleafclaim.com/downloads/MLFLongFormNotice_2009-01-29_en.pdf">proposed settlement agreement</a> [notice of proposed settlement, PDF] with class action plaintiffs who <a href="http://www.mapleleafclaim.com/claim.php?locale=en_CA&page=home">brought suit against the company</a> [class action website] in connection with sales of meat tainted with <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/listeriosis_gi.html">listeria monocytogenes</a> [CDC backgrounder], which sickened 56 Canadians and caused 20 deaths across the country in 2008. Under the proposed settlement, Maple Leaf Foods will pay between $25-$27 million to settle the claims of class members who submit to the settlement agreement:<blockquote>The Settlement provides for the creation of a $25 million (CDN) settlement fund (Settlement Fund) from which eligible consumers and/or their family members may receive varying levels of compensation. Notice costs, administration costs, and class counsel fees and disbursements as more particularly described below will also be paid out of the Settlement Fund. The Defendants will also pay up to a further $2 million (CDN) if the Settlement Fund is insufficient to fully compensate all eligible claims. The amount each claimant will receive depends upon the severity of their illness. For claimants who sustained physical symptoms consistent with Listeriosis, the compensation ranges from $750 (for physical symptoms lasting between 24-48 hours) up to $125,000 (for serious and long lasting physical injuries). The estates of Class Members who died as a result of symptoms consistent with Listeriosis will be paid $120,000, plus additional substantial amounts to immediate family members.</blockquote>The proposed settlement agreement must be approved by Canadian courts in several provinces. Hearings on the proposed settlement <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/02/02/maple.html">will be held</a> [CBC report] on March 5 in Ontario, March 10 in Saskatchewan, and March 20 in Quebec.<br /><br />Last year&#39;s outbreak of listeriosis was <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/media/nr-rp/2008/2008_13-eng.php">traced</a> [PHAC press release] to a Maple Leaf Foods processing plant near Toronto, Ontario. The plant was <a href="http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=1b59a416-3998-44fd-b771-fbcf63344161">shut down in August</a> [<em>Vancouver Sun</em> report], and is now running at limited production levels. The bacterial infection was spread through several products, which were promptly <a href="http://www.mapleleafclaim.com/downloads/ProductRecallList.pdf">recalled</a> [recall list, PDF] by the company. In response to the listeriosis outbreak, Maple Leaf Foods developed an action plan to ensure the ongoing safety of its products, including so-called <a href="http://www.mapleleafaction.com/food_safety_fact_sheet_en.html">&quot;enhanced food safety protocols&quot;</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Six detainees from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison, including three Uighurs, are seeking refugee status in Canada with the support of Canadian sponsors. The Uighurs were last year <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kiyemba-v.-bush">deemed</a> [<u>Kiyemba v. Bush</u> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">report</a>] not to be <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000948---a000-.html">unlawful enemy combatants</a> [10 U.S.C. &sect; 948a text; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">news archive</a>]. Lawyers for the men have said that US authorities have admitted the men were mistakenly picked up, and are ideal candidates for refugee status in Canada. They also have said that the men will face torture or even death if they are allowed to return to China.<br /><br />The three Uighur detainees are part of a group of 17  whom the US government have determined are not unlawful enemy combatants. They had initially been linked with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/03/mil-080312-cfr01.htm">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a militant group that seeks to secede from China, and has been designated a terrorist group by the US since 2002. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-10-09%20Kiyemba%20corrected%20release%20order%20%282008-10-09%29.pdf">ordered the release of the detainees</a> [opinion and order, PDF], writing that the Constitution prohibits detention without cause and that the individual right to freedom outweighs the other governmental branches&#39; right to deny entry to aliens. Judges for the DC circuit court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/kiyemba-order-10-20-08.pdf">stayed the order</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/dc-circuit-extends-stay-of-uighurs.php">report</a>] later that month pending appeal. In November, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] heard <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/dc-circuit-hears-uighur-release-appeal.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether the Uighur detainees can be released into the US. China has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">renewed its demand</a> [JURIST report] for the Uighurs to be repatriated to face charges there.

Under the sanctions, the companies are banned from trading with the US or US companies. The sanctions were imposed under the <a href="http://law.justia.com/us/codes/title22/22usc2797.html">Arms Export Control Act</a> [text], as well as executive orders issued in <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12938.pdf">1994</a> [Executive Order 12938 text, PDF] and&nbsp;<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&docid=fr22au01-130.pdf">2001</a> [Executive Order 13222 text, PDF]. The sanctions are not expected to have much direct impact on the companies, but are <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/02/america/sanctions.4-421557.php">seen as symbolic</a> [AP report] of the weapons proliferation stance of US President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">Barack Obama</a> [official website] and Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/index.htm">Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile].<br /><br />Aside from criticizing the practices of individual companies, the US and other countries have expressed concern over the weapons programs of both the Iranian and North Korean governments. In October 2008, <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website] head <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2596447.stm">Mohamed ElBaradei</a> [BBC profile] said he <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/iaea-chief-wants-north-korea-back-in.php">wants North Korea to return</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> [text, PDF; IAEA <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Treaties/npt.html">backgrounder</a>] after a five-year absence.

A Chinese court on Monday scheduled the trial date for Tuesday, leaving Huang&#39;s attorney less than 24 hours to prepare his defense and prompting an immediate legal challenge.

Huang remains one of China&#39;s most outspoken activists and will be tried on charges of illegal possession of state secrets. A new trial date has not yet been set.<br /><br />The Chinese court system remains the target of criticism for activist groups. Last July, China was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-accused-of-using-courts-to.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of using the courts to retaliate against journalists critical of government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] on Monday voted 75-21 to confirm <a href="http://www.cov.com/eholder/">Eric Holder</a> [professional profile] to serve as Attorney General. Last week, the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/senate-committee-approves-ag-nominee.php">voted 17-2 to approve</a> [JURIST report] Holder&#39;s nomination. Monday&#39;s debate over Holder&#39;s confirmation was partisan at times with committee chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Senator Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] denouncing Republican senators such as <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/">John Cornyn</a> (R-TX) [official website] who have asked Holder to pledge not to prosecute intelligence officials who participated in controversial interrogation techniques during the Bush administration. Holder did win the support of several Republican seantors, including ranking Republican judiciary committee member <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Senator Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) [official website]. Holder will be the first African-American to lead the Justice Department.<br /><br />Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/holder-condemns-waterboarding-as.php">told the committee</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">confirmation hearings</a> [materials; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/us/politics/16text-holder.html">transcript</a>] that he believes <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] constitutes torture. Then-President-elect Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/obama-confirms-holder-attorney-general.php">officially announced his nomination of Holder</a> [JURIST report] in December. Holder served as <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/index-dag.html">Deputy US Attorney General</a> [archive materials] during the Clinton administration. Republicans have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/republicans-target-reported-obama-ag.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Holder for his role in the 2001 pardon of fugitive financier <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html">Marc Rich</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Time</font> backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href=http://www.icj-cij.org/>International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website; JURIST <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/icj.php>news archive</a>] resolved a long-standing <a href=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=ru&case=132&k=95>dispute</a> [ICJ materials] between Ukraine and Romania Tuesday by <a href=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/132/14987.pdf?PHPSESSID=477be6276c3b33039da926f5a6d223d3>drawing a new maritime border</a> [judgment, PDF] between the countries, giving Romania four-fifths of waters believed to sit atop a sizable crude oil reserve. At issue was whether Ukraine&#39;s claim to Serpent Island - a small, X-shaped limestone formation - gave it territorial rights over the surrounding waters. The court&#39;s 15 judges unanimously approved the new boundaries. Romanian President Traian Basescu <a href="http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-5384684-romanian-president-traian-basescu-the-icj-decision-represents-huge-success-romanias-diplomacy.htm">praised</a> [HotNews report] the court&#39;s ruling, calling it a victory for Romania&#39;s Foreign Affairs Ministry. The Ukrainian presidential secretariat said the decision was a <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/34771">positive step</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report] toward cooperation between the two states. The decision is final and cannot be appealed.<br /><br />Romania <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2004/09/romania-to-sue-ukraine-in-icj-over.htm>initially filed suit in the ICJ</a> [JURIST report]  in 2004 after years of unsuccessful attempts to resolve the matter diplomatically. The ICJ <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/09/icj-hears-romania-ukraine-dispute-over.php>began hearing the case</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008, in which Romania argued Ukraine&#39;s claims to Serpent Island were illegitimate, as it inherited the territory from the Soviet Union, which annexed it illegally. Ukraine contended the island is currently occupied by military personnel and scientists, although Romania claimed the activity recent and an attempt to influence the court&#39;s decision. Tuesday&#39;s decision may be seen as a step toward energy independence for Ukraine, which has recently been in a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7240462.stm">dispute</a> [BBC profile] with Russia over gas supplies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The number of political prisoners in <a href="/countries/cuba.php">Cuba</a> [JURIST news archive] has declined from 234 in January 2008 to 205, while the number of brief detentions has increased, according to the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/todo-sobre/organismo/CCDHRN/Comision/Cubana/Derechos/Humanos/Reconciliacion/Nacional/575/">Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation</a> (CCDHRN) [<em>El Pais</em> backgrounder, in Spanish] Monday. The CCDHRN report <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUXtrV2QU_hugo-6AVuxgVM2n5JQD963KFH80">attributed the decline in the number of political prisoners</a> [AP report] to the lack of extended prison terms for those arrested, which was the custom until 2003. Despite the decrease in political prisoners, the country has experienced a significant rise in the number activists that are briefly detained by the government. In 2008, more than 1,500 activists were arbitrarily detained for a short period of time. The CCDHRN, led by Cuban human rights activist Elizardo Sanchez, is the only independent source of information regarding political arrests in Cuba. The group is considered illegal by the Cuban government, but its existence and operation is tolerated by the regime. The Cuban government officially denies the existence of political prisoners.<br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released its <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,CUB,4562d94e2,49705fa58,0.html">2009 report</a> [report, text] on Cuba. The report acknowledged some attempts in 2008 by the country to improve its position on human rights, but overall the Cuban government continues to deny its citizens their fundamental rights. In October, Cuba was ranked 169th in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/press-freedom-index-moves-us-up-war.php">seventh annual Worldwide Index of Freedom</a> [JURIST report] issued by <a href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=20">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RWB) [advocacy website; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=reporters+without+borders">archive</a>]. In December 2007, Cuba <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/cuba-to-sign-international-human-rights.php">agreed to sign an international human rights pact</a> [JURIST report] and to allow UN human rights of observers into the country beginning this year. The government <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/cuba-signs-international-human-rights.php">signed the treaties</a> [JURIST report] in February of 2008. Last year, the CCDHRN reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/cuba-held-fewer-political-prisoners-in.php">number of political prisoners in Cuba had decreased</a> [JURIST report] from 283 at the end of 2006 to to 234 at the end of 2007, but human rights abuses continued in the communist Caribbean state.

Under the ICC&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a>&nbsp;[text], the court may obtain jurisdiction over a non-signatory if alleged crimes are committed within its territory, but legal questions remain over whether the Palestinian Authority may transfer such jurisdiction given many countries&#39; refusal to recognize its legitimacy as a state. In addition to the charges already filed by Palestinian groups, a Syrian-based Hamas group <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20090202/119929556.html">announced</a> [RIA Novosti report] Monday that it plans to file charges of war crimes against Israeli leaders in international court.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Israel of war crimes for allegedly using white phosphorus in the midst of a dense civilian population.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The British government intends to present legislation that would allow for members of the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/lords/index.cfm">House of Lords</a> [official website] to be removed for improper behavior, according to a statement by UK Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor <a href="http://www.jackstrawmp.org.uk/Biography.asp">Jack Straw</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jack+straw">news archive</a>] during a Sunday <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00h4d2s">interview</a> [audio] with BBC Radio 4. The announcement comes a week after members of the House of Lords were <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5581547.ece">accused of taking cash payments from lobbyists</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Times</span> report] in exchange for amending legislation. Under current law, members of the House of Lords can not be removed from the chamber. This has allowed several members, including Canadian-born financier and former media mogul <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/black_conrad/">Conrad Black</a> [CBC materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=conrad+black">news archive</a>], to remain in the chamber despite being convicted of criminal offenses. Straw hopes the upcoming Constitutional Renewal Bill will not only include measures to remove members of the House of Lords for criminal activity, but also for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7863509.stm">improper behavior</a> [BBC report], similar to what exists in the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/commons/index.cfm">House of Commons</a> [official website].<br /><br />The House of Lords has been a target for reform for many years. In 2003, cabinet members <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2721979.stm">rejected</a> [BBC report] five different reform initiatives that varied from an entirely elected to entirely appointed House of Lords. Proposals were again initiated in 2006, with the release of a document by a cross-party working group on Lords&#39; reform that hinted at a half-elected, half-appointed House with 450 Lords sitting in the chamber. In 2007, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/uk-pm-urges-house-of-lords-reform.php">pushed</a> [JURIST report] for a half-elected, half-appointed House of Lords that removed all but 92 House members who still inherit their parliamentary seats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spain is considering legislation to limit the the scope of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/IOR53/020/2001/en/dom-IOR530202001en.html">universal jurisdiction</a>&nbsp;[AI backgrounder] applied by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cja.org/cases/snc.shtml">National Court</a> [CJA backgrounder], according to Spanish <a href="http://www.cadenaser.com/espana/articulo/justicia-estudia-prohibir-audiencia-nacional/csrcsrpor/20090131csrcsrnac_4/Tes">media reports</a>&nbsp;[CadenaSer report, in Spanish] Sunday. If adopted, the Reform of the Judiciary Act would limit the court&#39;s jurisdiction over war crimes and genocide charges to those cases that have a substantial link to the country or its citizens. It would require that the suspects be arrested in Spain, and that the crimes be committed against Spaniards or have some historical link to the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Australian <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/index.html">Federal Court</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/30.html?query=Vasiljkovic">dismissed</a> [judgment text] the application of former Serbian paramilitary commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/dragan_vasiljkovic_478.html">Dragan Vasiljkovic</a> [Trial Watch backgrounder] for review of a <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/australia-court-orders-accused-serb-war.php">2007 extradition order</a> [JURIST report] that he be handed over to Croatian authorities. Vasiljkovic, also known as Daniel Snedden, is accused of war crimes in connection with his treatment of Croatian prisoners during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">1991-1995 War of Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/aboutct/cowdroy.html">Justice Dennis Cowdroy</a> [official profile] rejected Vasiljkovic&#39;s arguments that he would not be afforded a fair trial in Croatia:<blockquote>The Court ... finds that there is no specific evidence of pre-trial bias against the applicant, nor is there a nexus established between the applicant&#8217;s apprehension and the question of whether he would be prejudiced at his trial. Further, the evidence before the Court establishes that the Croatian judiciary is capable of providing a fair trial to the applicant.</blockquote>Cowdroy also found that there is no requirement for a jury trial under <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s80.html">Section 80</a> of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/">Australian Constitution</a> [texts], nor was the delay between the offenses and extradition an abuse of process, since Vasiljkovic would be tried in Croatia, and not in Australia.<br /><br />Vasiljkovic was <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/accused-serb-war-criminal-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Australia in 2006 at Croatia&#39;s request. In 2007, a lower Australian court ordered that he be handed over to Croatian authorities pursuant to their extradition request. Vasiljkovic moved to Australia in 1969 at the age of 15 and became an Australian citizen before returning to Serbia to participate in the conflict. A former prosecutor at the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] accused Australia in 2005 of <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/war-criminals-seeking-safe-haven-in.php">becoming a safe haven</a> [JURIST report] for war criminals.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt&#39;s Agouza Appeals Court Saturday overturned the prison sentences of four newspaper editors convicted of defaming <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.eg">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [official website] and the ruling <a href="http://www.ndp.org.eg/en/index.aspx">National Democratic Party</a> (NDP) [party website]. The four men, Ibrahim Eissa, editor of <a href="http://www.addustour.com/Default/Default.asp"><span style="font-style:italic;">Al Dustour</span></a>; Adel Hammouda, editor of <a href="http://www.elfagr.org/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Al-Fagr</span></a> [media websites, in Arabic]; Wael Al-Abrashi, editor of the independent newspaper <font style="font-style:italic;">Sawt Al-Umma</font>; and Abdel-Halim Qandil, former editor of <font style="font-style:italic;">Al-Karama</font>, were <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/rights-groups-accuse-egypt-of.php">convicted</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in 2007 and were each sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay fines of approximately $3600. The appeals court upheld the fines against the men, and both <a href="http://she2i2.blogspot.com/2009/01/egypt-overturning-of-jail-sentences.html">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [press release] and the <a href="http://anhri.net/en/reports/2009/pr0131.shtml">Arabic Network for Human Rights Information</a> [press release] issued statements Saturday saying the fines should also be lifted. In its release, AI wrote:<blockquote>We are relieved that the four editors&#8217; prison sentences have been overturned but the imposition of heavy fines and the prospect of trials on vaguely worded charges constitute unacceptable obstacles to freedom of the press in Egypt...<br /><br />We call on the Egyptian authorities to stop using the press law to muzzle freedom of speech and to recognize the important role a free and independent press in any society.</blockquote> The men have been free on bail since their conviction, and have said they will continue to appeal the fines.<br /><br />Eissa had earlier received a two-month <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/egypt-prosecutor-appeals-sentence-of.php">prison sentence</a>&nbsp;for spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about the health of Mubarak, as well as a <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/rights-groups-slam-egypt-for-jailing.php">third sentence</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] of a year in prison for a separate report. In October 2007 , two journalists were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/egypt-court-convicts-opposition-leader.php">convicted of libel <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] for writing a story about an illegal land transaction involving the Ministry of Religious Endowments at a secret auction. Under Egyptian law, citizens may file lawsuits against individuals who make statements that harm society, and the accused can face criminal punishment if found guilty. Mubarak previously <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/journalists-group-decries-repression.php">pledged to decriminalize press offenses</a> [JURIST report] in Egypt, but has yet to do so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The director of Guatemala&#39;s National Compensation Program Cesar Davila announced Friday that the <a href="http://www.guatemala.gob.gt/">Guatemalan government</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/countries/guatemala.php">news archive</a>] has filed more than 3,000 criminal complaints for human rights violations allegedly committed during the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">1960-1996 civil war</a> [GlobalSecurity Backgrounder]. The complaints were <a href="http://www.lahora.com.gt/notas.php?key=43476&fch=2009-01-30">filed on behalf of more than 5,000 victims</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Hora</span> report, in Spanish] who allege they were subjected to forced disappearance, forced displacement, extrajudicial execution, torture, and rape at the hands of soldiers, paramilitaries, and others. The attorney general will now process the complaints and forward them to the Office of Human Rights. <br /><br />The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala&#39;s large indigenous population. According to a UN report released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. In response to these violations, the Guatemalan government founded the PNR in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. More than 1,000 complaints were filed in 2008. The PNR hopes to file the majority of the complaints within the next year. In February 2008, the Guatemalan government announced <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/guatemala-panel-to-declassify-documents.php">plans to declassify documents</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights abuses committed by its military during the civil war.

Tian&#39;s lawyer claims it was not his client who decided to sell milk with higher levels of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/melamine.html">melamine</a> [FDA backgrounder], but a board member tabbed by New Zealand dairy firm Fonterra, which held a large share in Sanlu Group. Tian&#39;s appeal to the Higher People&#39;s Court of Hebei Province asserts that the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People&#39;s Court <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/01/content_10747023.htm">lacked evidence to support a conviction</a> [Xinhua report] for manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products.<br /><br />In December 2008, a court ordered at-fault dairy companies to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-dairy-companies-to-pay-160.php">pay $160 million</a> [JURIST report] in compensation to the victims&#39; families. In January, lawyers for the families of 213 Chinese children sickened or killed by the contaminated milk <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-lawyers-file-class-action-lawsuit.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> [official website, in Mandarin], China&#39;s highest court, to hear a class action lawsuit against 22 dairy companies involved in the contamination, seeking more than $5 million in damages. Early last month, police in China <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-police-detain-parents-of-children.php">detained five parents</a> [JURIST report] of children who became sick after drinking melamine-tainted milk, preventing the parents from participating in a news conference.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div></FONT></div><br></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/surrogates/">Manhattan Surrogate Court</a> [official website] has <a href="/pdf/nysamesexinheritance.pdf">ruled</a>&nbsp;[text, PDF] that the surviving partner of a <a href="http://http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST archive] performed in Canada is entitled to inherit the estate of a deceased spouse. The decision issued late last week leaves all of H. Kenneth Ranftle&#39;s estate to his surviving spouse, J. Craig Leiby. Judge Kristen Booth Glen wrote that she found no legal basis to treat the marriage of the two men differently than heterosexual marriages made in other countries or states. New York has <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202427973725">yet to authorize same-sex marriages</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">New York Law Journal</span> report] within the state, but recognizes same-sex marriages performed in Canada and other states.<br /><br />In May 2008,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.state.ny.us/governor/bio/index.html">New York Governor David Paterson</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/new-york-to-recognize-out-of-state-same.php">mandate</a> [JURIST report], requiring that any and all out-of-state same-sex marriages be recognized as legal within the state of New York.  This mandate supported an intermediate appellate court ruling in <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/martinez_decision_020108.pdf">Martinez v. County of Monroe</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-york-court-rules-that-state-must.php">report</a>], holding that legal same-sex marriages performed outside the state are entitled to recognition in New York.  In September of that year, the New York Supreme Court [official website] <a href="http://data.lambdalegal.org/in-court/downloads/golden_ny_20080902_decision-and-order.pdf">dismissed</a>  [decision and order; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-york-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">report</a>] a challenge to Paterson&#39;s directive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] announced Wednesday that his administration will place a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/new_rules/">$500,000 cap on executive compensation</a> [WH press release] for companies receiving &quot;exceptional assistance&quot; from the federal government. The statement came in conjnction with an announcement from <a href="http://treasury.gov/organization/bios/geithner-e.shtml">Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner</a> [official profile], highlighting <a href="http://treasury.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm">increased restrictions on financial institutions</a> [Treasury press release] receiving government assistance. The US <a href="http://treasury.gov/">Treasury Department</a> [official website] outlined restrictions, including a $500,000 cap on executive compensation, a requirement that any additional executive compensation be paid in the form of stocks that would be untradeable until the federal government recouped its investment in the financial institution, an increased ban on so-called &quot;golden parachutes&quot; for senior executives, and a requirement of a company-wide policy adopted by the board of directors regarding the approval of luxury expenditures. Financial institutions subject to the heightened restrictions include any institution requiring more assistance than is allowed under a widely available standard program, including <a href="http://www.aig.com/about-aig_20_19308.html">AIG</a>, <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com/index.cfm?page=about">Bank of America</a>, and <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/business/index.htm">Citi</a> [corporate websites]. Obama said:<blockquote>As part of the reforms we&#39;re announcing today, top executives at firms receiving extraordinary help from U.S. taxpayers will have their compensation capped at $500,000 - a fraction of the salaries that have been reported recently. And if these executives receive any additional compensation, it will come in the form of stock that can&#39;t be paid up until taxpayers are paid back for their assistance.<br /><br />Companies receiving federal aid are going to have to disclose publicly all the perks and luxuries bestowed upon senior executives, and provide an explanation to the taxpayers and to shareholders as to why these expenses are justified. And we&#39;re putting a stop to these kinds of massive severance packages we&#39;ve all read about with disgust; we&#39;re taking the air out of golden parachutes.<br /><br />We&#39;re asking these firms to take responsibility, to recognize the nature of this crisis and their role in it. We believe that what we&#39;ve laid out should be viewed as fair and embraced as basic common sense.</blockquote>Wall Street firms and financial journalists <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jAUFDrU3LuIgj4TKrN96be_M46oA">reacted cautiously</a> [AFP report] to the new restrictions, citing fears that decreased compensation would lead to more talented executives leaving top positions on Wall Street.<br /><br />Obama&#39;s remarks and the increased restrictions on executive employment come as the US government and the Obama administration attempt to grapple with the ongoing global <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=financial+crisis">financial crisis</a> [JURIST news archive]. Attempts to gain control over the roiling credit markets and possible widespread bank insolvencies have included the passage in September of a  <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">$700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report], creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which provided economic assistance to at-risk financial institutions. In early October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission began an <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sec-begins-accounting-rules-review-as.php">agency review of financial accounting procedures</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;<a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-234.htm">mark-to-market</a>&quot; [SEC backgrounder] rules. On Monday, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] ambassador to Washington <a href="http://www.eurunion.org/eu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=36&Itemid=50">John Bruton</a> [official profile] indicated that the EU would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-hints-at-legal-action-if-us-stimulus.php">prepared to take legal action</a> [JURIST report] if US Congress includes a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c111:4:./temp/~c111QIipeX:e528872:">&quot;Buy American&quot; provision</a> [text] in an <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.1:">economic stimulus package</a> [H.R.1 materials] that is currently being considered by the US Senate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> [official website] on Wednesday overwhelmingly adopted a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+20090204+SIT+DOC+WORD+V0//EN&language=EN">resolution</a> [text, DOC] encouraging European Union (EU) member states to assist the closure of the the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison by accepting former prisoners for resettlement. The measure, which passed 542-55 with 51 abstentions, noted that though ultimate responsibility for the inmates lies with the US, EU member states if asked should act:<blockquote>to cooperate in finding solutions, to be prepared to accept Guantanamo inmates in the Union, in order to help reinforce international law, and to provide, as a priority, fair and humane treatment for all; recall[ing] that Member States have a duty of loyal cooperation to consult each other regarding possible effects on public security throughout the Union.</blockquote>The resolution also called for the US to ensure protection of the detainees&#39; fundamental rights by holding fair trials where necessary, expeditiously repatriating those prisoners who will not be charged, and offering asylum or humanitarian protection to those who cannot return to their home country for fear of persecution. The vote followed a floor debate, with members of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7868282.stm">Christian Democrat, Socialist, and Liberal parties showing strong support</a> [BBC report] for accepting detainees. On Tuesday, European Commission Vice President for Justice, Freedom and Security <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/welcome/default_en.htm">Jacques Barrot</a> [official website] said that EU member states willing to accept former prisoners <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gSDyeWb_iJ25e1iYwa-VlkV7PyTgD9649GQG0">may receive financial aid to assist the transfers</a> [AP report], though no further details have been released. <br /><br />Last week, Council of the European Union Secretary-General <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/index.asp?cmsid=246&lang=EN">Javier Solana</a> [official website] indicated that several EU member states would likely be <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/gena/105561.pdf">willing to accept</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eu-member-states-to-consider-accepting.php">report</a>] some former prisoners, though acceptance may be conditioned on the US providing careful background checks to prove that the detainees pose no danger to the host country. French Foreign Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6666707.stm">Bernard Kouchner</a> [BBC profile] has noted that legal obstacles facing the transfer of the detainees would be different for each host country, and that their acceptance would be determined on a case-by case basis. On January 22, US President Barack Obama issued an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/gitmo_final_exec_order.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp to be closed &quot;as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order.&quot;

Bruton wrote:<blockquote>As you are aware, the United States and the European Communities are both party to the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). This provides U.S. goods and services access to substantial procurement opportunities in the European Communities and its Member States, in return for access to procurement opportunities in the United States for EC goods and services. I expect that you will ensure that U.S. obligations under the GPA will continue to be observed. I would note that the EC has strenuously avoided any efforts to restrict procurement opportunities for U.S. goods and services in its response to the global economic downturn.</blockquote>US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] has already separated himself from the &quot;Buy America&quot; provisions, saying in a Tuesday <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/President44/Story?id=6795877&page=3">interview</a> [transcript]: &quot;That is a potential source of trade wars that we can&#39;t afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.&quot; Canadian officials, who have also argued that such a provision would violate international trade law, have <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/04/obama-protectionism.html">welcomed</a> [CBC report] Obama&#39;s statement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The British <a href=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/home>Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] confirmed Wednesday that a UK Army officer was <a href="http://www.blogs.mod.uk/defence_news/2009/02/defence-in-the-media-4-february-2009.html">arrested in Afghanistan</a> [MOD blog post] and returned to the London for questioning on suspicion of revealing secret information to a human rights organization. Lt. Col. Owen McNally is <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/article2202404.ece">accused</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span> report] of violating the <a href=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1351839>Official Secrets Act 1989</a> [text] by supplying civilian casualty figures to a woman from a human rights group. A conviction under the statute entails a maximum 14 year prison sentence. The MOD is releasing no further details at this time.<br /><br /><a href=http://www.hrw.org/>Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] has <a href=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/07/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-airstrikes>published very specific data</a> [HRW report] related to civilian casualties in Afghanistan, which US and NATO forces feel undermines their efforts there.

Corporal Daniel James was convicted of violating the Secrets Act in November 2008. Unlike McNally, James was accused of relaying British military information to Iran.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/courtofmilitarycommissionreview.html">US Court of Military Commission Review</a> (USCMCR) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/cmcr-stay-order-2-4-09.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] a government&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/us-continue-jawad-cmcr.pdf">request</a> [motion, PDF] for a 120-day continuance on an intermediate appeal in its case against&nbsp;<a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a>&nbsp;[JURIST news archive] detainee&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/CMCRJAWAD1.html">Mohammed Jawad</a>&nbsp;[DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jawad">news archive</a>]. The government asked the court to grant the continuance in light of an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">executive order</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] requiring a review of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] system, arguing that proceeding with the case would be futile until the review is complete. Lawyers for&nbsp;Jawad <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/jawad-response-cmcr-jan-09.pdf">opposed</a> [text, PDF] the continuance, arguing that the USCMCR lacked authority to grant the motion, and that any likely changes to the military commission system would not favor the government&#39;s position. Siding with the government, the court reasoned that it ought to grant deference to the government given national security and foreign policy concerns:<blockquote>[T]he reason for the delay is to allow the Department of Defense to participate in an Interagency review, not only of the military commission process, but also the status of those apprehended and presently detained at Guantanamo Bay - including the Appellee - their conditions, and the factual and legal bases for their apprehension and detention, all in the context of the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.</blockquote>The government is appealing an&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-military-judge-excludes-confession.php">earlier decision</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report]&nbsp;by a military judge to exclude a confession by Jawad on the grounds that it was solicited through the use of torture.&nbsp;<br /><br />Jawad&#39;s trial was initially&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/12/guantanamo-judge-delays-jawad-military.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] in December to give prosecutors more time to appeal the exclusion of his confession. In January, the USCMCR&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-circuit-hears-guantanamo.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the exclusion.&nbsp;Jawad has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2007/Jawad%20Charge%20Sheet.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">report</a>] with attempted murder and intentionally causing serious bodily injury for his alleged role in a December 2002 grenade attack in Kabul that injured two US soldiers and an Afghan translator. In May 2008, Jawad <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/guantanamo-detainee-files-motion-to.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] to have all charges against him dismissed, alleging that he has been tortured in US custody and subjected to the so-called &quot;frequent-flier program,&quot; in which certain inmates are moved between cells at two to four hour intervals in an attempt to cause physical stress through sleep deprivation.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced Tuesday that it will <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR08-09.PDF">hear oral arguments</a> [press release, PDF] on March 5 in the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm#casefilings">three cases</a> [case filings] challenging the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a> [materials], the ballot measure <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed in November</a> [JURIST report] that banned same-sex marriage. The court issued an order listing the three issues to be briefed and argued as follows:<blockquote>(1) Is Proposition 8 invalid because it constitutes a revision of, rather than an amendment to, the California Constitution? <br />(2) Does Proposition 8 violate the separation of powers doctrine under the California Constitution? <br />(3) If Proposition 8 is not unconstitutional, what is its effect, if any, on the marriages of same-sex couples performed before the adoption of Proposition 8?</blockquote>Live broadcast of oral arguments will be available through the court-designated cable network <a href="http://www.calchannel.com/">California Channel</a> [media website]. Sixty-three organizations have filed <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm#amicus">amicus briefs</a> [briefs], forty-three on behalf of petitioners and twenty to uphold the ban.<br /><br />In November, the California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/S168047_S168066_S168078-11-19-08_ORDER.pdf">agreed</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-high-court-agrees-to-hear.php">report</a>] to hear the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-groups-challenge-california-same.php">three cases</a> [JURIST report], but denied <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/s168047-amendedpetitionforextraordinaryrelief.pdf">petition to stay</a> [text, PDF] its enforcement. Proposition 8 has become a focal point for gay rights, and during the campaign donors from across the US and several foreign countries contributed $83 million in total for both sides of the issue, setting US <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/california-marriage-battle-sets.php">fundraising records</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Africa&#39;s Pietermaritzburg High Court  announced Wednesday that the corruption trial of <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [political website] leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>] and arms dealer Thint would be <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/PDFs/TIMETABLEORDER_final%20.pdf">delayed</a> [timetable, PDF] until after the country&#39;s presidential election. The agreement calls for Zuma to apply for permanent stay of prosecution on May 18, and oral argument is scheduled for Aug. 25. The election will be held between April and June, and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5huHffQqimfMM-8j1W5JxhWtVxS7A">Zuma is favored</a> [AFP report] to become president. Zuma plans to appeal to the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court of South Africa</a> [official website] the decision of the <a href="http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/">Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/south-africa-appeals-court-reinstates.php">reinstate the charges</a>, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST reports] in September 2008. The ANC <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=ancdocs/pr/2009/pr0204a.html">expressed strong support</a> [press release] for Zuma, referring to the criminal proceedings as &quot;the injustices he has now suffered for far too long.&quot;<br /><br />Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country&#8217;s deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but ultimately acquitted and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as ANC deputy vice president. In July 2008, the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The London High Court revealed in a <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/judgments_guidance/mohamed-judgment4-04022009.pdf">judgment</a> [text, PDF] issued Wednesday that the US government threatened to reconsider and possibly end its intelligence-sharing operations with the UK if a summary of the alleged torture of <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [Reprieve profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>] was made public by the court. The summary in question consisted of a number of paragraphs describing the conditions and circumstances of Mohamed&#39;s imprisonment, redacted from the High Court&#39;s judgment in its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-high-court-rules-foreign-office-must.php">August 2008 ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the UK Foreign Office must turn over evidence essential to Mohamed&#39;s defense. In maintaining the redaction of the passages in question, Lord Justice Thomas and Mr. Justice Lloyd Jones wrote:<blockquote>Moreover, in the light of the long history of the common law and democracy which we share with the United States, it was, in our view difficult to conceive that a democratically elected and accountable government could possibly have any rational objection to placing into the public domain such a summary of what its own officials reported as to how a detainee was treated by them and which made no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters. Indeed we did not consider that a democracy governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials or officials of another State where the evidence was relevant to allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, politically embarrassing though it might be.<br /><br />We had no reason at that time to anticipate there would be made a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the United States Government that it would reconsider its intelligence sharing relationship, when all the considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a limited but important summary of the reports.</blockquote>Those associated with the trial reportedly were surprised that the US government&#39;s threat to reconsider or end intelligence sharing with the UK, which was initially made by the Bush administration, had been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1135491/Judges-fury-U-S-attempts-pressure-Britain-covering-evidence-Briton-tortured-Guantanamo.html">reiterated</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] by the administration of current US President Barack Obama.<br /><br />Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. He was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, he <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">asked the UK government</a> [letter, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">report</a>] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved. For most of 2007, Binyam was one of five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+residents+guantanamo">UK residents detained at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Three of those were <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11576">released</a> [DOD press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-residents-released-from-guantanamo.php">report</a>] from US custody in December. The official status of a fourth detainee remains unclear.

Miliband&#39;s statement was in response to a <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/judgments_guidance/mohamed-judgment4-04022009.pdf">judgment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-juges-reveal-us-threatened-to.php">report</a>] issued by the London High Court Wednesday, in which Lord Justice Thomas and Mr. Justice Lloyd Jones wrote that the US threatened to reconsider or end intelligence-sharing with the UK. Miliband said:<blockquote>It therefore was &#8211; and remains &#8211; my judgment that the disclosure of the intelligence documents at issue by order of our courts against the wishes of the US authorities would indeed cause real and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country. For the record, the United States authorities did not threaten to &quot;break off&quot; intelligence cooperation with the UK. What the United States said, and it appears in the open, public documents of this case, is that the disclosure of these documents by order of our Courts would be &quot;likely to result in serious damage to US national security and could harm existing intelligence information-sharing between our two governments.&quot; That&#8217;s a simple affirmation of the facts of intelligence cooperation.</blockquote>Miliband concluded his remarks by saying that there was &quot;no prejudice&quot; to Mohamad&#39;s case as a result of Wednesday&#39;s judgment.<br /><br />At issue in Mohamad&#39;s case were a number of paragraphs describing the conditions and circumstances of his imprisonment, redacted from the High Court&#39;s judgment in its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-high-court-rules-foreign-office-must.php">August 2008 ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the UK Foreign Office must turn over evidence essential to Mohamed&#39;s defense. Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. He was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, he <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">asked the UK government</a> [letter, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">report</a>] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved. For most of 2007, Binyam was one of five UK residents detained at Guantanamo Bay. Three of those were <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11576">released</a> [DOD press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-residents-released-from-guantanamo.php">report</a>] from US custody in December. The official status of a fourth detainee remains unclear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Some terror suspects living under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4288407.stm">control orders</a>  [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=control+order+UK">news archive</a>] have managed to maintain contact with terror cells, the UK&#39;s counter-terrorism law ombudsman said in his <a href="http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-publications/publication-search/prevention-terrorism-act-2005/lord-carlile-fourth-report.pdf?view=Binary">fourth annual report</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Carlile">Lord Carlile of Berriew</a> [JURIST news archive] found that even though in most instances a control order <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uk-control-orders-should-not-exceed-2.php">cannot be justified for longer than two years</a> [JURIST report] because suspects cease to be desirable terror operatives, evidence shows that, &quot;there are a few controlees who, despite the restrictions placed upon them, manage to maintain some contact with terrorist associates and/or groups, and a determination to become operational in the future.&quot; The report commended the efforts of the Secretary of State to explore alternatives to the orders and to seek prosecution and conviction by a jury where possible. Carlile endorsed all of the orders issued in 2008 and noted that &quot;control orders remain a largely effective necessity for a small number of cases, in the absence of a viable alternative for those few instances.&quot; Also Tuesday, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/organisation/ministers1/jacqui-smith/">Home Secretary Jacqui Smith</a> [official profile] <a href="http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-publications/news-speeches/control-orders">introduced a draft order</a> [press release] to parliament to renew the <a href="http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/prevention-terrorism-act-2005/">Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005</a> [HO materials], which is <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uk-mps-extend-control-order-legislation.php">set to expire in March</a> [JURIST report].  Smith called the control order legislation a &quot;balance between safeguarding society from the risk of terrorism and the preservation of the rights of the individual,&quot; and said that the government will carefully review the recommendations made in Carlile&#39;s report.<br /><br />Control orders allow the British government to impose house arrest and electronic surveillance on suspects and to forbid them from using mobile phones and the Internet when there is not enough evidence to prosecute. They were first <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/first-control-orders-issued-under-new.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] by the government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005 and, apart from being politically controversial, have already run into <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/uk-appeals-court-upholds-ruling.php">problems in the courts</a> [JURIST report]. The UK Law Lords <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-top-court-limits-control-orders.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in a series of decisions in October that the government can continue to impose control orders on terror suspects in lieu of detention, but said that some elements of the orders issued under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 violate human rights. Last March, UK Home Office minister Tony McNulty told members of Parliament that control orders are <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uk-control-orders-in-force-against-11.php">currently in force against 11 people</a> [JURIST report] suspected of terrorist activity, though Tuesday&#39;s report put the latest number at 15.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The sister-in-law of embattled former Taiwanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chen+shui-bian">news archive</a>] on Thursday entered a guilty plea at the Taipei District Court on charges of money laundering related to a corruption scandal surrounding the former leader and his associates. Chen Chun-ying admitted she had forged documents and transferred money to bank accounts upon orders from Chen Shui-bian and his wife, claiming that she did not know the money was illegally obtained and did not profit from the transfer. Businessman Kuo Chuan-ching also pleaded guilty to paying $2.7 million in kickbacks in exchange for a building contract. Kuo is expected to <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=857659&lang=eng_news">serve as a witness for the prosecution</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taiwan News</span> report]. Prosecutors reportedly rejected Chen Chun-ying&#39;s request to plea bargain due to ongoing investigations in the scandal. <br /><br />Chen Chun-ying is the fourth family member to enter guilty pleas for their roles in the scandal. The former president was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] last year by Taiwanese prosecutors on charges including embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering. His wife, his son and daughter-in-law, three former presidential aides, and eight other associates and family members have also been indicted.  Chen Shui-bian has been detained since his November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-arrested-on.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of embezzling money from the state affairs fund.  Last month, Taiwan&#39;s <a href="http://tph.judicial.gov.tw/en/default.htm">High Court</a> [official website]  <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Shui-bian&#39;s appeal protesting the court&#39;s previous decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-ex-president-appeals-pretrial.php">detain him</a> [JURIST report] while he awaits trial on corruption charges.

Ginsburg, 75, is expected to remain at the <a href="http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/44.cfm">Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</a> [official website] in New York, where the surgery was performed, for seven to 10 days before being released. According to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg had no symptoms of the disease before it was discovered during a routine physical examination in late January. Pancreatic cancer has a low survival rate upon diagnosis, but early discovery and treatment of the condition can improve the patient&#39;s prognosis. Ginsburg was diagnosed and treated with radiation and chemotherapy for <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iyVqJd8vdcPt1gmARHBuDb-KdXswD965ITF80">rectal cancer</a> [AP report] in 1999.<br /><br />News of Ginsburg&#39;s illness comes during a period of heightened speculation over the future ideological direction of the Supreme Court during the administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile]. In a recent column for the website Slate, senior editor Dahlia Lithwick <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2210361/pagenum/1">called for</a> [Slate op-ed] the appointment of a liberal justice in the mold of conservative <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/about/biographiescurrent.pdf">Associate Justice Antonin Scalia</a> [official biography, PDF].

Panetta said:<blockquote>I believe the Director should be responsible for shaping the role of CIA in the twenty-first century to protect this nation, to provide credible and accurate intelligence to policy makers, to undertake those missions that will enhance our security, and to always perform our responsibilities according to the law and our Constitution.</blockquote>Panetta also promised to build a strong relationship between the CIA and Congress. After several hours of questioning, the committee recessed and will reconvene Friday morning at 10:00 AM.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-nominates-top-intelligence.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] Panetta to lead the CIA last month.

Owen McNally, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-military-officer-suspected-of.php">arrested this week</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of leaking secret information regarding civilian casualty figures in Afghanistan.

Reid claims that any information she received was not in violation of the <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1351839">Official Secrets Act of 1989</a> [text] and that the media reports are a &quot;vicious, false slur.&quot; Reid acknowledged that the reports may endanger her life and expressed confusion as to why her government would want her reputation &quot;dragged through the mud.&quot; Director General of Media and Communication at the MOD Nick Gurr <a href="http://www.blogs.mod.uk/defence_news/">responded</a> [MOD blog post] to Reid&#39;s article in a letter to the <em>Guardian</em> by claiming that her accusations are false and that the MOD did not give her name to the media.<br /><br />Human Rights Watch has published <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/07/afghanistan-civilian-deaths-airstrikes">specific data</a> [HRW report] on civilian casualties in Afghanistan. Last year, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">United Nations Committee on Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-libel-law-discourages-free-speech-un.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that the Official Secrets Act as well as other restrictive libel laws prevented issues of public interest from being reported on. The <a href=http://www.parliament.uk/>UK Parliament</a> [official website] recently <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/11/uk-parliament-panel-pushing-for.php>debated security-related reporting restrictions</a> [JURIST report], as opponents have criticized the Secrets Act for precluding important issues from public debate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in New Jersey <a href="http://www.aclu-nj.org/news/aclunjwinscaseallowingsame.htm">granted a divorce</a> [ACLU-NJ press release] Friday to a lesbian couple married in Canada. Speaking from the bench, Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson said her decision was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hu_RVio1rMtFSA7PaHVUjvzqcnawD966C9UO0">in harmony with the state&#39;s tradition</a> [AP report] of recognizing valid marriages performed outside the state, but cautioned that her ruling would not extend such recognition to areas other than divorce. The <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/lps/">New Jersey Attorney General&#39;s office</a> [official website] argued that the relationship should be dissolved as a civil union rather than recognized as a marriage, consistent with a 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/new-jersey-to-recognize-out-of-state.php">Attorney General&#39;s opinion</a> [JURIST report; PDF <a href="http://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases07/ag-formal-opinion-2.16.07.pdf">text</a>]. The ACLU countered that such an outcome might leave the marriage intact in Canada and states that recognize <a href="http://http//jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive]. In 2006, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-jersey-civil-unions-bill-signed.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/A4000/3787_I1.PDF">legislation</a> [PDF text] providing legal recognition to same-sex civil unions in New Jersey. <br /><br />Late last month the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/surrogates/">Manhattan Surrogate Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-surviving.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report; PDF <a href="/pdf/nysamesexinheritance.pdf">text</a>] that the surviving partner of a same-sex marriage performed in Canada is entitled to inherit the estate of a deceased spouse in New York state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] spokesperson Robert Wood said Wednesday that Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> [official profile] has told Congress that she intends to <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2009/02/116001.htm">begin preliminary negotiations with Russia</a> [press briefing] on a new treaty that would significantly lower nuclear stockpiles in both countries. The 1991 <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START) [text], which limited the US and Russia to 6,000 nuclear warheads each, will expire at the end of the year. Wood told reporters that the Obama administration &quot;is very serious about further reductions in nuclear weapons&quot; and plans to put negotiations with Russia on a replacement treaty &quot;on the fast track.&quot; Nuclear disarmament <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5juOXxl8pdFl8jNwNYhtXNfZu4soQD965O1R80">languished</a> [AP report] under the Bush administration, and diplomats and officials are <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/06/nuclear-disarmament-russia-us">optimistic</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian </span>report] that Moscow will quickly come to an agreement with the Obama administration to cut warheads to about 1,000. Negotiations may be slowed, however as some important arms control positions have not yet been filled in Washington. <br /><br />In addition to the proposed negotiations with Russia, the State Department is taking a strong stance against foreign violations of US rules against the spread of weapons and missile technology. On Monday, the department <a href="http://regulations.justia.com/search?agency=268&rule=yes&notice=yes&proposed_rule=yes&registers=between&min-day=2&min-month=2&min-year=2009&max-day=2&max-month=2&max-year=2009&query=&search=Search">announced</a> [Federal Register materials, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-issues-sanctions.php">report</a>] that it instituted sanctions against Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean arms companies for violations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4758935.stm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [BBC profile] Friday refused to sign an Italian government decree intended to stop the father of <a href="http://www.zadig.it/speciali/ee/">Eluana Englaro</a> [materials, in Italian], who has been in a vegetative state for 16 years, from removing her feeding tube. Napolitano said the measure was unconstitutional because it would effectively overrule last year&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-high-court-approves-feeding-tube.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Notizie/Notizie.asp">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] to allow removal of the tube, thus violating the separation of power between the executive and judicial branches. Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Berlusconi">news archive</a>] had urged approval of the legislative decree and has convened Italy&#39;s Cabinet to draft new legislation to be presented to the Italian <a href="http://www.parlamento.it/">Parliament</a> [official website, in Italian] on Monday. While a decree from the legislature requires the president&#39;s signature, an actual bill can become law if it is approved by both houses of Parliament. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=euthanasia">Euthanasia</a> [JURIST news archive] is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/italy-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">currently illegal in Italy</a> [JURIST report], and there is no law that allows an unconscious patient to give future directions on his or her treatment.  <br /><br />Eluana Englaro has been in a coma since an automobile accident in 1992. Her father, Beppino Englaro, has been fighting to have her feeding tube removed since 1999. In 2005, <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/">Italy&#39;s Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/italian-high-court-orders-feeding-tube.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court&#39;s ruling to keep her feeding tube in place because they could not find specific evidence on Englaro&#39;s personal views of life and death. In October of last year, the Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/giurisprudenza/pronunce/scheda_ultimo_deposito.asp?sez=ultimodep&Comando=LET&NoDec=334&AnnoDec=2008&TrmD=&TrmM=">rejected</a> [decision text, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/italy-constitutional-court-endorses.php">report</a>] a parliamentary challenge to a Milan appeals court decision which held doctors could remove Enlargo&#39;s feeding tube because she was found to be in an &#39;irreversible&#39; vegetative state. In November the Court of Cassation affirmed that decision, ruling that Enlargo&#39;s father could remove her feeding tube. Catholic groups and conservative politicians opposed the decision <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/church-fury-as-coma-woman-allowed-to-die-1017959.html">arguing</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Independent</font> report] that the court is permitting euthanasia.

The new charter provides for <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-constitution-reforms-called.php">redistribution of land and natural resource revenues</a> [JURIST report], the creation of congressional seats reserved for indigenous representatives, and the institution of special courts for some indigenous communities. It also prohibits the posting of foreign military bases within the country and eliminates an existing one-term limit on Bolivian presidents.<br /><br />The new constitution had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-voters-pass-measures-to.php">strongly opposed</a> in regions where more voters own land or are of European descent, but was nevertheless <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bolivia-approves-constitutional.php">approved in a national referendum</a> [JURIST reports] in January. In October 2008, the Bolivian National Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/bolivia-president-offers-concession-to.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bolivia+constitution">proposed reforms</a> [JURIST news archive] after Morales agreed not to run for re-election in 2014. In August 2008, Morales <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">won a confidence referendum</a>, which he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">personally proposed</a> [JURIST reports] in a bid to legitimize his campaign for the constitutional changes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] President <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/index.htm">Jose Manuel Barroso</a> [official profile] noticeably irritated Russian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] at a <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/eng/events/2031.html">joint news conference</a> [transcript] held in Moscow Friday when Barroso <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g8_x0Wt3gaVeOhxYYTTFGmvjwf5AD9668LU8A">commented on apparent human rights violations in Russia</a> [AP report]. Barroso&#39;s comments on talks that had taken place earlier with Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] about the rule of law in Russia upset Putin, who responded by accusing European countries of human rights violations in regards to prisoners and immigrants. Barroso in return noted recent rights violations in Russia, particularly the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-human-rights-lawyer-murdered.php">murders of journalists and human rights activists</a> [JURIST report]. Putin attempted to end the discussion at that point. The news conference had been held after a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/09/217&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">meeting</a> [press release] between European Commission members and Russia intended to increase ties and discuss issues such as energy security and the global economic crisis.<br /><br />Despite an <a href="http://www.rferl.org/Content/Russia_Ukraine_To_Sign_Gas_Agreement/1371753.html">energy supply crisis</a> [RFE report] which ended last month, human rights issues remain a primary point of contention between the EU and Russia. In October last year, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">issued two decisions</a> [JURIST report] finding Russia in violation of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] in several cases concerning the deaths or abductions of Russian nationals in Chechnya in 2000. In May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Russia was responsible for the disappearance of a dozen people during Russian armed raids in Chechnya in 2002 and 2003. In July 2007, the court ruled that Russian authorities were responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/echr-rules-russia-responsible-for.php">shooting deaths of 11 unarmed Chechen civilians</a>, and in June 2007 it held that Russian authorities were liable for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/russia-responsible-for-chechen-deaths.php">2003 deaths of four Chechen family members</a> [JURIST reports].

The documents show that in 2006&nbsp;ICE policy increased arrest quotas from 125 to 1000 per year and eliminated a previous requirement that 75 percent of arrests must be &quot;criminal aliens.&quot; The documents also indicate a significant increase in the ratio of non-criminal to criminal immigrants arrested by ICE&nbsp;since the changes were instituted. Clinic director Peter Markowitz said the Bush administration&#39;s efforts failed by their own standards:<blockquote>ICE&#8217;s home raids have primarily led to the arrests of individuals who posed no risk to society and have come at a significant cost to immigrant families and to ICE&#8217;s own enforcement priorities. ... ICE has created tremendous bureaucratic incentives for fugitive operation teams to abandon focus on high priority targets in favor of a shotgun approach of undisciplined home raids.</blockquote>Also Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/">Migration Policy Institute</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/NFOP_Feb09.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on ICE fugitive operation teams and concluded that despite an increased budget, they have not met their goal of arresting dangerous individuals.<br /><br />Recently-appointed Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] has issued a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1233353528835.shtm">directive</a> [text] calling for review and assessment of the ICE fugitive operation teams. ICE has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/hundreds-of-suspected-illegal-aliens.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] many non-criminal illegal immigrants in the past year, many of whom were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST report]. In April, Seton Hall Law School&#39;s Center for Social Justice <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/04/lawsuit_claims_immigration_rai.html">filed a lawsuit</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Star-Ledger</font> report] claiming that warrantless immigration raids violate the US Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China reiterated its request Thursday that all Chinese Muslims, or Uighurs, held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] be <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/xwfw/fyrth/t475487.htm">returned to China</a> [press release, in Mandarin] after the prison&#39;s closing. Spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/">Chinese Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Mandarin] <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/JiangYu/">Jiang Yu</a> [official profile] said that China objects to other countries accepting any one of the 17 detainees and that international law dictates they be sent back. The statement comes just two days after three Uighurs <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/guantanamo-uighur-detainees-seek-asylum.php">sought refugee status in Canada</a> [JURIST report], but it is <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE5135J420090204">not clear whether they will be accepted</a> [Reuters report]. China maintains the detainees should be brought back to face charges that they are members of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/03/mil-080312-cfr01.htm">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a militant group calling for separation from China and designated a terrorist group by the United States for suspected ties to al Qaeda.  The US government has been hesitant to release the Uighurs back to China, fearing they will tortured upon their return. <br /><br />In July, China reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-executes-two-uighur-muslims-for.php">executed two Uighurs</a> [JURIST report] alleged to be members of the ETIM. Thirteen other Uighurs were given jail terms ranging from ten years to life imprisonment. In 2006, China <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/china-wants-gitmo-uighurs-back-says.php">criticized</a> the US for <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">releasing five Uighurs to Albania</a> [JURIST reports], where officials reviewed their applications for asylum. In 2005, a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/federal-judge-rules-chinese-gitmo.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that two Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay could be detained indefinitely even though their imprisonment was unlawful because they could face death or torture in China. The US State Department has said the Uighurs are among detainees who <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/us-to-release-100-guantanamo-detainees.php">will be released</a> [JURIST report] once the US receives assurances that they will not be persecuted in their home countries or finds other countries willing to accept them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> [official website] amended the &quot;Buy American&quot; clause of the latest <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.1:">economic stimulus package</a> [HR 1 materials] Wednesday to clarify that the provision will be applied consistent with US obligations under international trade agreements. The revised language was proposed by <a href="http://dorgan.senate.gov/">Sen. Byron Dorgan</a> (D-ND) [official website]. The Senate also <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00044">voted</a> [materials] 31-65 to reject an amendment proposed by <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/">Sen. John McCain</a> (R-AZ) [official website] that would have stripped the provision from the bill entirely. The previous version of the provision required that all goods used in a construction project, particularly iron and steel, be manufactured in the US in order to receive stimulus funding. Many countries, including Canada, are <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUKN0551421420090205">pleased</a> [Reuters report] with the Senate&#39;s move to amend the provision, but the European steel confederation <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/">Eurofer</a> [official website] believes the move <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/index.php/eng/News-Publications/Press-Releases/EUROFER-warns-US-Senate-s-amendment-on-Buy-American-Bill-does-little-to-remove-the-negative-effects-on-EU-industry">does not go far enough</a> [press release].<br /><br />The previous version of the bill <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-hints-at-legal-action-if-us-stimulus.php">raised global concerns</a> [JURIST report] about protectionism. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] has already separated himself from the &quot;Buy American&quot; provision, saying in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/President44/Story?id=6795877&page=3">interview</a> [transcript] earlier this week: &quot;That is a potential source of trade wars that we can&#39;t afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Many UN member states are <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1316871&ct=6750317">failing to hold other countries accountable for human rights violations</a> [press release], according to a <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1277549/k.BF70/Home.htm">UN Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/atf/cf/%7B6DEB65DA-BE5B-4CAE-8056-8BF0BEDF4D17%7D/Mutual%20Praise%20Society.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Friday. The report, entitled &quot;Mutual Praise Society,&quot; focused on meetings of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] and tracked reports made by various countries about the status of other UN members. Finding that the majority of countries failed to provide any form of accountability to other nations, the report stated:<blockquote>The substantial data compiled in this study reveals, however, that the reviews conducted by the vast majority of countries participating in the UPR process are failing to achieve its stated purpose. More than 300 UPR interventions were analyzed and evaluated, as detailed in 12 country charts. Out of 55 countries examined&#8212;including all 47 members of the UN Human Rights Council&#8212;only 19 had average scores indicating that they contributed positively. Tragically, a majority of 32 out of 55 countries acted as a mutual praise society, misusing the process in order to legitimize human rights abusers, instead of holding them to account.</blockquote>Canada was the only country to obtain the highest rating of &quot;very constructive&quot; for its commitment to challenging other nations and intervening when necessary to condemn human rights violations. Only eight other countries received positive rankings. Sixteen countries, including Zimbabawe, Sudan, and North Korea received the lowest, or &quot;destructive,&quot; rating due to their praise and encouragement of countries who routinely are found to violate human rights.  <br /><br />UN Watch, a Geneva based non-governmental organization, has previously criticized the UNHRC. In 2007, the group released a <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/atf/cf/%7B6DEB65DA-BE5B-4CAE-8056-8BF0BEDF4D17%7D/DAWN%20OF%20A%20NEW%20ERA%20--%20HRC%20REPORT%20--%20FINAL.PDF">report</a> [text PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/human-rights-watchdogs-criticize-un.php">report</a>] accusing the UNHRC of neglecting to censure countries that commit gross human rights violations. In December, UN Watch <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-rights-council-adopts-resolution.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] at a meeting of the UNHRC concerning the UNHRC&#39;s condemnation of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. UN Watch criticized the council for failing to reinstate an independent monitor and commence a fact-finding mission to investigate abuses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nominee for Deputy Attorney General <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/david_ogden/">David Ogden</a> [professional profile] Thursday defended his representation of parties opposing anti-pornography and pre-abortion parental notification laws during <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3644&wit_id=7590">testimony</a> [prepared statement; <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/webcast/judiciary02052009-0930.ram">webcast</a>] before the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [committee website]. Ogden, who is presently in private practice at the law firm <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/">WilmerHale</a> [firm website], has come under attack from conservative groups, including <a href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/">Focus on the Family</a> and the <a href="http://www.afa.net/">American Family Association</a> (AFA) [advocacy websites], for his <a href="http://www.citizenlink.org/CLtopstories/A000009260.cfm">representation of clients including Playboy</a> [Focus on the Family commentary], and his <a href="http://www.afa.net/alert_ogden_20090204.html">legal arguments against social issues</a> [AFA commentary] such as prior parental notifications of abortions. Ogden is expected to be approved by the Judiciary Committee and then confirmed by the Senate. Ogden served as Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, under <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bill+clinton">former president Bill Clinton</a>.<br /><br />President Obama announced his <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-appoints-clinton-era-lawyers-to.php">appointment of Ogden</a> [JURIST report] to the position of Deputy Attorney General last month. Ogden&#39;s future boss, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-senate-confirms-holder-as-attorney.php">confirmed in a Senate vote on Monday</a> [JURIST report]. Holder is the first African-American to lead the Justice Department. Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/holder-condemns-waterboarding-as.php">told the committee</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">confirmation hearings</a> [materials; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/us/politics/16text-holder.html">transcript</a>] that he believes <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] constitutes torture. Then-President-elect Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/obama-confirms-holder-attorney-general.php">officially announced his nomination of Holder</a> [JURIST report] in December. Holder served as <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/index-dag.html">Deputy US Attorney General</a> [archive materials] during the Clinton administration. Republicans have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/republicans-target-reported-obama-ag.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Holder for his role in the 2001 pardon of fugitive financier <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html">Marc Rich</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Time</font> backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Britain&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/lords_constitution_committee.cfm">House of Lords Constitution Committee</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldconst/18/18.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldconst/18/18ii.pdf">evidence appendix</a>, PDF] Friday saying that the country&#39;s use of widespread video surveillance and personal data collection pose a threat to citizens&#39; privacy and freedom. The committee said that while such surveillance and data collection could serve legitimate law-enforcement purposes, those interests should be balanced against privacy concerns, including Article 8 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The committee also issued specific recommendations that DNA data on individuals be consolidated to the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/using-science/dna-database/">National DNA Database</a> [materials], and that closed-circuit television surveillance only be used under strict oversight and where it has been shown to be effective.<br /><br />In February 2008, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">UK Home Office</a> [official website] said that the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uk-government-says-no-plans-to-create.php">has no plans</a> [JURIST report] to create a compulsory DNA database for British citizens. Rights groups&nbsp;have criticized&nbsp;the National DNA Database for <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/uk-right-groups-warns-of-growing.php">retaining information</a> on criminal suspects after they are found innocent, and for <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-civil-rights-commissioner-vows.php">displaying a racial bias</a> [JURIST reports] against minorities. In September 2007, UK rights group&nbsp;<a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>&nbsp;[advocacy website] released a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2007/britain-s-privacy.shtml">report</a>&nbsp;[press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/uk-right-groups-warns-of-growing.php">report</a>]&nbsp;arguing that the government was endangering the privacy of law-abiding Britons by increasingly using mass surveillance to profile people rather than targeting individual criminal suspects using intelligence-led policing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands of Venezuelans gathered Saturday in Caracas and other cities to protest a proposed <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20906&Itemid=27">constitutional amendment</a> [text, in Spanish] that would eliminate presidential term limits in the country. The amendment, which would allow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">news archive</a>] to seek re-election in 2012, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/venezuela-parliament-approves-amendment.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">Venezuelan National Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] last month, but must be approved in a national referendum on February 15 before taking effect. Both the protesters and opposition politicians have <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-opposition-criticizes.php">accused Chavez</a> [JURIST report] of using the constitutional reforms to consolidate his power. There have also been reports that Chavez&#39;s government has been using <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/02/08/america/venez.4-425569.php">increasingly harsh tactics</a> [IHT report] to quiet student and other groups opposing the amendment. A similar amendment was among constitutional reforms <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/venezuelans-reject-proposed.php">rejected by voters</a> [JURIST report] in a 2007 referendum, but a January poll by <a href="http://www.datanalisis.com/website/site/p_contenido.asp">Datanalisis</a> [corporate website] showed that a small majority of likely voters now favor the amendment.<br /><br />Venezuelans who favor eliminating term limits have been equally vocal, and in December a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/venezuela-initially-approves-referendum.php">petition signed by almost five million people</a> [JURIST report] endorsing the amendment was given to the National Assembly. Trying to distinguish the current amendment from his failed 2007 effort, Chavez has acknowledged that the earlier reforms, which would have allowed him to stand indefinitely for re-election, handpick local leaders under a new political map, create new types of communal property, and to suspend civil liberties during states of emergency, were &quot;quite profound and intense,&quot; and may have been too ambitious.

After a second day of <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/hearings.cfm?hearingId=3648">confirmation hearings</a> [materials] before the <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/index.html">US Senate Intelligence Committee</a> [official website], Panetta told reporters that he would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNqjrsQ96LSw38bHitcinz_SQAWgD96684PO1">not prosecute Bush administration officials</a> [AP report] because they were following legal orders. Panetta also backtracked on testimony he gave Thursday, saying that that while the Obama administration would not engage in the same type of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] seen under the Bush administration, they would continue to send detainees abroad, but only on the condition that they be treated humanely.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-nominates-top-intelligence.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] Panetta to lead the CIA last month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan reissued a request to the UN Security Council Thursday to delay for one year war crimes charges against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile] for alleged genocide in Darfur. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">sought an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for al-Bashir on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and the ICC is expected to decide whether to issue the warrant as early as this month. With the backing of several African and Arab states, the Sudan Ambassador to the UN Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohammad <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggcjIWK-x83DdVYQ-vmbpMrxdKnQ">urged</a> [AFP report] the Security Council to heed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">request</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] and invoke the <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/keydocuments/english/romestatuteofthe7.html#c28">Article 16 of the Rome Statute</a> [text], which allows the UN to pass a resolution that defers a prosecution in the ICC for 12 months. The AU is concerned an indictment would pose a threat to the process in the Sudan. Also on Thursday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon&#39;s Special Representative for Sudan Ashraf Jehangir Qazi briefed the Security Council on Ban&#39;s latest <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2009/61">report</a> [text], which <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29792&Cr=sudan&Cr1=cpa">expressed</a> concern that an arrest warrant for al-Bashir would create an unfavorable Sudanese reaction. Ban wrote:<blockquote>While I am encouraged by the assurances of continued support by the Government, I am also concerned about remarks by some of its officials that the Government may redefine its relationship with UNMIS (the UN Mission in Sudan that is mainly concerned with helping to enforce the CPA) should an arrest warrant be issued against President al-Bashir, </blockquote>A Security Council resolution staying the ICC&#39;s indictment would require a majority of nine votes and the concurring votes of all five permanent members. <br /><br />ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [offical profile] applied for an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">arrest warrant for Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in July. The warrant was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-arrest-of-sudan-leader-could.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">South African President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile]. In December, ICC judges gave Moreno-Ocampo until January 26 to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/icc-judges-seek-more-information-on.php">provide supplemental information</a> [JURIST report] about a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7020596.stm">September 2007 attack</a> [BBC report] on an <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> [official website] base in Haskanita. The events at the ICC were preceded by a Security Council statement in June <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">urging Sudan to work with the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to &quot;put an end to impunity for the crimes committed in Darfur.&quot; Sudan is not a party to the ICC, but must cooperate to fulfill its obligations under <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">Council Resolution 1593</a> [text], which established jurisdiction over the Darfur situation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Convening authority of military commissions <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20070207crawford.pdf">Susan Crawford</a> [official profile, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=susan+crawford">news archive</a>] announced Thursday that the Pentagon has formally <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/withdrawalofcharges_alnashiri.pdf">dropped charges</a> [text, PDF] against suspected USS Cole bomber <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsalnashiri.html">Abd al-Rahimal al-Nashiri</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">news archive</a>]. Crawford&#39;s order ends the last active military commission trial, complying with President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] mandating a reprieve of the prosecution of all cases at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST archive] military prison. The announcement that the charges against al-Nashiri would be dropped ended a conflict between the Obama administration and several US military personnel, created last week when Army Col. James Pohl <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2009/01/29/14/nashiri.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">rejected</a> [order and defense response, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/guantanamo-judge-rejects-government.php">report</a>] the request of government prosecutors to delay the proceedings against al-Nashiri. Earlier on Thursday, Pohl announced that he would <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2009/RulingDefMotionRedacted.pdf">rule</a> [order, PDF] on Monday regarding a motion concerning measures to limit al-Nashiri&#39;s ability to see and hear at his military tribunal, despite Obama&#39;s executive order. Crawford&#39;s decision to drop charges effectively supersedes the necessity for Pohl to make such a ruling.<br /><br />Al-Nashiri was accused of terrorism, attempted murder, and providing material support to terrorism for his alleged role in planning the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061205055035/http://defenselink.mil/pubs/cole20010109.html">2000 al Qaeda attack</a> [DOD report] on the <a href="http://www.cole.navy.mil/">USS Cole</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=USS+Cole">news archive</a>]. He was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/guantanamo-detainee-charged-with-uss.php">charged in June</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions+act">news archive</a>]. He would have faced the death penalty if found guilty at his military commission hearing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Turkish court on Thursday sentenced a Kurdish member of the <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/index1.htm">Grand National Assembly</a> [official website, in Turkish], the Turkish parliament, to 18 months in prison on charges of spreading terrorist propaganda. Aysel Tugluk was convicted in connection with a speech she gave in 2006 during which she explained her party&#39;s objection to labeling the outlawed <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pkk.htm">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> (PKK) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] a terrorist organization, saying that the separatist fighters were &quot;heroes to some.&quot; Tugluk gave the speech at a rally for the minority <a href="http://www.demokratiktoplumpartisi.com/">Democratic Society Party</a> (DTP) [official website, in Turkish], which supports Kurdish independence and has been accused of connections to the PKK.  Tugluk said that she plans to appeal the decision, though she said she may face <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL5778001">other charges for at least 30 different comments</a> [Reuters report] she has made about the Kurdish conflict. Although Turkish lawmakers are protected from prosecution while in office, a recent high court decision held that those provisions do not apply to terrorism charges.<br /><br />In 2007, Tugluk and DTP President Ahmet Turk were <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/kurd-party-leaders-imprisoned-in-turkey.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of distributing political materials in a language other than Turkish after they circulated a pamphlet in support of imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader <a href="http://www.freedom-for-ocalan.com/english/index.htm">Abdullah Ocalan</a> [advocacy website]. In December, Kurdish activist <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/691/000134289/">Leyla Zana</a> [NNDB profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/turkish-court-sentences-kurdish.php">sentenced to 10 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for supporting the PKK in public speeches. Turkey&#39;s limitations on free speech, particularly under <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/document.do?id=ENGEUR440352005">Article 301</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=article+301">news archive</a>], have drawn international criticism and contributed to the nation&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eu-report-on-turkey-accession-cites.php">delayed accession</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> [official website]. That article&#39;s original language making the denigration of &quot;Turkishness&quot; a crime was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/turkish-president-signs-amendment.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] last year, limiting protection to the &quot;Turkish Nation&quot; instead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.zadig.it/speciali/ee/">Eluana Englaro</a> [materials, in Italian], an Italian woman at the center of a right-to-die controversy in the country, died Monday, shortly after the <a href="http://www.senato.it/index.htm">Italian Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] began debate on <a href="http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=Ddlpres&leg=16&id=393277">legislation</a> [draft text, in Italian] that would make it a crime to remove a feeding tube from a comatose  patient. Englaro&#39;s father removed her feeding tube on Friday, following the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refusal</a> [JURIST report] of Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4758935.stm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [BBC profile] to sign a order prohibiting the action. Napolitano said he could not issue the order given a&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-high-court-approves-feeding-tube.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Notizie/Notizie.asp">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] allowing removal of the tube. The legislation, heavily supported by&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Berlusconi">news archive</a>], is scheduled to be voted on by the Senate on Tuesday, and it is not clear whether Englaro&#39;s death will effect its passage. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=euthanasia">Euthanasia</a> [JURIST news archive] is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/italy-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">currently illegal in Italy</a> [JURIST report], but the Court of Cassation distinguished between the removal of a feeding tube and more affirmative steps to end a patient&#39;s life.<br /><br />Eluana Englaro has been in a coma since an automobile accident in 1992. Her father, Beppino Englaro, has been fighting to have her feeding tube removed since 1999. In 2005, <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/">Italy&#39;s Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/italian-high-court-orders-feeding-tube.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court&#39;s ruling to keep her feeding tube in place because they could not find specific evidence on Englaro&#39;s personal views of life and death. In October of last year, the Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/giurisprudenza/pronunce/scheda_ultimo_deposito.asp?sez=ultimodep&Comando=LET&NoDec=334&AnnoDec=2008&TrmD=&TrmM=">rejected</a> [decision text, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/italy-constitutional-court-endorses.php">report</a>] a parliamentary challenge to a Milan appeals court decision which held doctors could remove Enlargo&#39;s feeding tube because she was found to be in an &quot;irreversible&quot; vegetative state. The Court of Cassation&#39;s November ruling affirmed that decision. Catholic groups and conservative politicians opposed the decision <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/church-fury-as-coma-woman-allowed-to-die-1017959.html">arguing</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Independent</span> report] that the court is permitting euthanasia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US financier <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] consented to a <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20889.htm">partial judgment</a> [SEC press release] with the US <a href="http://sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] Monday over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against him. According to the SEC, the agreement will continue the previously imposed preliminary injunction, but in consenting to the agreement, Madoff will neither admit nor deny the SEC&#39;s allegations. The agreement between the SEC and Madoff must be approved by Judge Louis Stanton of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [court website]. Criminal <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">securities fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] filed against Madoff are not affected by Monday&#39;s agreement. Also on Monday, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Linda Thomsen announced she was <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-22.htm">stepping down from her post</a> [SEC press release]. Thomsen had been with the SEC since 1995 and had recently <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/sec-officials-pledge-new-commitment-to.php">given testimony</a> [JURIST report] before the US Senate Banking Committee concerning SEC enforcement and the Madoff scandal. <br /><br />In the week following Madoff&#39;s charges, SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-launching-investigation-of-failure.php">report</a>] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long. In December, then-President-elect <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president-elect_obama_names_key_regulatory_appointments/">named</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/Leadership/p009733">Mary Schapiro</a> [professional profile] as the SEC Chairman, replacing Cox. Madoff was charged with securities fraud in December for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts]. UK financial firm <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/">Bramdean Alternatives Limited</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/news/send_attachment/48">raised concerns</a> [statement, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/uk-financial-institution-assails-us.php">report</a>] about the US financial regulatory process after its value dropped by more than 35 percent following news of its exposure to the fraud.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://interior.gov/welcome.html">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] announced plans Tuesday to <a href="http://interior.gov/news/09_News_Releases/021009.html">reverse offshore drilling policies</a> [press release] established by former US <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">President George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] at the end of his presidency. The move comes as part of a larger effort by the administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] to create a comprehensive energy plan. The new plan involves extending the public comment period on a proposed 5-year plan for oil and gas development on the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by 180 days, assembling a detailed report from <a href="http://interior.gov/index.html">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] agencies on conventional and renewable offshore energy resources, holding four regional conferences to review these findings, and expediting renewable energy rulemaking for the OCS. In <a href="http://www.interior.gov/secretary/speeches/021009_speech.html">remarks</a> [text] delivered Tuesday in conjunction with the announcement, Salazar said:<blockquote>We need a new, comprehensive energy plan that takes us to the new energy frontier and secures our energy independence. We must embrace President Obama&#39;s vision of energy independence for the sake of our national, economic, and environmental security.<br /><br />Today, I am announcing a new way forward for our offshore energy resources. It will restore order to a broken process, so that we can make decisions about the OCS based on sound information.</blockquote>In October, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-passes-legislation-to-lift.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] to lift an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore drilling</a> [JURIST news archive] ban. That same month, the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-senate-approves-expiration-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the expiration of a moratorium on offshore drilling that denied the DOI congressional funds to pursue drilling exploration on the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines. In July, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-lifts-executive-order-banning.php">lifted an executive ban on offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST report] put in place during his father&#39;s presidential administration. In June, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">called on Congress to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [JURIST report], saying that it should also allow drilling to begin in the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> [official website] in Alaska. Bush argued that resources currently off-limits to energy companies could offset rising fuel prices. Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] in the Arctic, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require several years and a massive infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040422_CPAORD_13_Revised_Amended.pdf">Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a> (CCCI) [establishment order, PDF] on Sunday set a Feb. 19 trial date for the Iraqi journalist accused of throwing his shoes at former US President George W. Bush. The court allowed the charge of assaulting a foreign leader, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, to stand, despite defendant <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7787792.stm">Muntader al-Zaidi&#39;s</a> [BBC profile] attempt to have it reduced to attempted aggression. Defense lawyer Dhiya al-Saadi said he will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jy8aSBQyoZY5JWxvLssnwEEVMTzQ">try to have the charges dismissed</a> [AFP report] and emphasized that his client was trying to insult, not injure, the US president. The announcement of a trial date comes after an official <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">investigation</a>, which initially led to a trial <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-court-delays-trial-of-shoe.php">postponement</a> [JURIST reports].<br /><br />Those opposed to al-Zaidi&#39;s trial have criticized the CCCI for failing to meet international standards of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/14/quality-justice">fairness and due process</a> [HRW report], and have alleged that al-Zaidi was beaten while in custody. There have also been allegations that a purported apology letter from al-Zaidi <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/18/world/main4675737.shtml">had been forged</a> [CBS report]. The shoe-throwing incident occurred at a <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html">Dec. 14 joint news conference</a> [transcript] at which Bush and Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] signed a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] governing the future US military presence in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A senior Iraqi official confirmed Monday that four Iraqi prisoners were released from the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison into Iraqi custody for further interrogation. The anonymous official also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD967V5FG0">confirmed</a> [AP report] that only one Iraqi citizen remains a prisoner at Guantanamo. The <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">US Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12449">announced</a> [DOD press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/us-military-announces-transfer-of-six.php">report</a>] last month that the four Iraqi prisoners were released and returned to Iraq. Prisoner Hassan Abdul Hadi al-Jawhar&#39;s family was informed of his release by the International Red Cross, but they have not received any information on where he is currently located. Hassan, who was arrested in Afghanistan based on his association with the Taliban and his participation in the anti-Saddam resistance in Iraq, was never charged with a crime.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Mexican government published a <a href="http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5079751&fecha=09/02/2009">law</a> [draft text, in Spanish] Monday that will create a database of mobile phone users in the country, including vital information and fingerprints, once it takes effect in April. The law, published in the <a href="http://www.dof.gob.mx/">Official Gazette of the Federation</a> [official website, in Spanish], amends certain provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act, and was passed into law by the Mexican Congress last year. According to the draft law, the database will be established to combat extortion, threats, kidnapping, organized crime, and drug trafficking. The law will require mobile telecommunications firms to provide authorities with the name, address, nationality, identification number, and fingerprints of customers, as well as the type of communication utilizing the provider&#39;s network, in some cases. It is <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKN09529514">unclear</a> [Reuters report] whether the Mexican government will provide any funding for the establishment of the database. <br /><br />The Mexican law comes as governments worldwide attempt to reconcile free and open communications with the security threats presented by terrorism and organized criminal activity. In November, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/uk-government-delays-telecommunications.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] from its immediate legislative agenda a controversial security database bill that would have required telecoms to keep records of all domestic phone calls, e-mails, and Internet activity. Also in November, the lower house of the German parliament approved a new law that <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/germany-parliament-passes-new-anti.php">expanded the power</a> [JURIST report] of the German federal police to undertake online and telephone surveillance. In June, the Swedish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sweden-approves-wiretapping-bill.php">passed a controversial wiretapping law</a> [JURIST report] that gave the country&#39;s electronic surveillance agency broad authority to monitor international telephone and electronic communications passing through the country. In October 2007, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/fcc-again-refuses-investigation-of.php">refused to investigate</a> [JURIST report] the involvement of US telecommunications firms in the US National Security Agency&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">domestic surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian lawmakers have said they <a href="http://www.corriere.it/english/09_febbraio_10/eluana_9057b400-f78c-11dd-8e36-00144f02aabc.shtml">still plan to vote</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</font> report] on <a href="http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=Ddlpres&leg=16&id=393277">legislation</a> [draft text, in Italian] that would make it a crime to remove a feeding tube from a comatose patient, despite the death Monday of <a href="http://www.zadig.it/speciali/ee/">Eluana Englaro</a> [materials, in Italian], the woman whose case gave rise to the bill. Following the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-woman-in-euthanasia-controversy.php">announcement of the death</a> [JURIST report], Italian health minister <a href="http://www.governo.it/Governo/Biografie/ministri/Sacconi_maurizio.html">Maurizio Sacconi</a> [official profile, in Italian] said debate and voting on the bill was still important to prevent the death from &quot;being in vain.&quot; Englaro&#39;s death, which was reportedly earlier than expected given the removal of her feeding tube on Friday, <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-02-10_110334827.html">is now being investigated</a> [ANSA report] by the <a href="http://www.aiim.it/">Italian Medical Association</a> [official website, in Italian], but a spokesperson for the group said it was too early to determine if her doctors had acted appropriately.  In reaction to the news of her death, organizations in other parts of Europe have also <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4016487,00.html">called for their governments</a> [Deutsche Welle report] to create more definite rules on end-of-life decision making.<br /><br />The removal of Englaro&#39;s feeding tube followed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refusal</a> [JURIST report] of Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4758935.stm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [BBC profile] to sign an order prohibiting the action. Napolitano said he could not issue the order given a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/italy-high-court-approves-feeding-tube.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Notizie/Notizie.asp">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] allowing removal of the tube. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=euthanasia">Euthanasia</a> [JURIST news archive] is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/italy-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">currently illegal in Italy</a> [JURIST report], but the Court of Cassation distinguished between the removal of a feeding tube and more affirmative steps to end a patient&#39;s life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] urged the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] Monday to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/obama-admin-reply-re-enemy-2-9-09.pdf">refrain from addressing the definition of an enemy combatant</a> [response, PDF], an exercise which the DOJ argues could force the Court to unnecessarily decide the scope of the President&#39;s military detention authority over prisoners at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].  Responding to last month&#39;s <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv2378-175">order</a> [text] in which the Court invited the government &quot;to submit any refinement of their position on the appropriate definition of &#39;enemy combatant,&#39;&quot; the DOJ said President Barack Obama had <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">ordered</a> [executive order, text] a comprehensive, inter-agency review of the disposition of all detainees being held at Guantanamo and recommended that the Court deal with future detainee matters on a case-by-case basis, explaining: <blockquote>This...approach is consistent with longstanding practice of courts to decide only the narrow issues before them.  It avoids holdings that are potentially unnecessary or unnecessarily broad concerning difficult and important questions.  Particular cases may be subject to resolution without reaching broad questions about the scope of detention authority.</blockquote>Last month on rehearing, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/06-1197-1158056.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that it had <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/dc-circuit-rejects-enemy-combatant.php">no jurisdiction over Guantanamo detainees&#39; petitions</a> [JURIST report] for subject-matter review of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; status decisions. The current definition of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; was set out last June by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>], which provided a broad basis for holding a prisoner without charges.  The Court held that a suspect could be detained if it were shown that he or she had provided support to Taliban or al Qaeda forces, even absent direct involvement in hostilities with US forces abroad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A special panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2009-02/44975285.pdf">tentatively ruled</a> [opinion; PDF] on Monday that California must reduce its prison population in order to relieve overcrowding. Based on the evidence presented, the panel concluded that overcrowding has resulted in the state&#39;s failure to deliver constitutionally-adequate mental and physical health care to inmates.  The panel found that a release order is the only <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3626.shtml">appropriate remedy</a> [18 USC &sect; 3626] for the unconstitutional prison conditions, stating: <blockquote>Other forms of relief suggested by various participants are without adequate evidentiary support or appear infeasible as well as incapable of curing the violations presently existing in the California prison system.</blockquote>State Attorney General Jerry Brown opposed the decision, <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1678">commenting</a> [press release], &quot;The court&#8217;s tentative ruling is not constitutionally justified. Therefore, the state will appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court when the final order is issued.&quot; The release order would mean that prisons could only hold 120-145 percent of design capacity, requiring the early release of an estimated 36,000 to 57,000 inmates. Those opposed to the release order fear that the state does not have the funds for the support programs associated with the release of such a large number of inmates, but the panel asserted that decreasing the number of inmates could save the state $900 million annually in prison costs.<br /><br />Overcrowding has been a significant problem for California prisons for many years. In August 2008, California&#39;s court-appointed prison medical overseer <a href="http://www.mcgeorge.edu/x509.xml">J. Clark Kelso</a> [official profile] asked the court to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-prison-receiver-asks-court.php">force the state to pay $8 billion</a> [JURIST report] over the next five years to improve prison hospitals and bring inmate healthcare up to constitutional standards. Two months earlier, a California court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-court-upholds-inmate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state constitution permitted easing overcrowding by transferring prisoners to out-of-state facilities. The transfers had been ordered in an <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/proclamation/4278/">emergency proclamation</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/california-governor-proclaims.php">report</a>] issued by <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> [official website; JURIST news <a href="/currentawareness/schwarzenegger.php">archive</a>] in 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="/countries/southkorea.php">South Korea</a> [JURIST news archive] appellate court on Tuesday upheld a landmark lower court ruling authorizing removal of life-support from a comatose woman. Tuesday&#39;s decision by the Seoul High Court affirmed the December ruling of the Seoul Western District Court that ordered <a href="http://www.yuhs.or.kr/en/contents.asp?cat_no=2737">Yonsei Severance Hospital</a> [hospital website] to remove the 77-year-old woman from a life-support respirator she has relied on for artificial breathing since falling into a vegetative state in February 2008. While refusing to characterize the action as &quot;voluntary euthanasia&quot;, the  <a href="http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2900894">High Court issued guidelines</a> [<em>Joong Ang Daily</em> report] for removing patients from life support, including ensuring that the patient has no possibility of recovery and had previously formed a serious intention of stopping treatment, ensuring that the treatment to be stopped must be linked to maintaining the patient&#39;s current state, and mandating that doctors not be allowed to stop pain-reducing treatment. The Yonsei Severance Hospital <a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/02/11/200902110044.asp">intends to appeal the High Court&#39;s ruling</a> [<em>Korea Herald</em> report] to the <a href="http://eng.scourt.go.kr/eng/main/Main.work">Supreme Court of Korea</a> [official website].<br /><br />Several courts and governments have recently tackled legal issues surrounding the withdrawal of life-support, food and treatment from persons in a persistent vegetative state. Earlier this week Italian lawmakers indicated that they would proceed with a vote on <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-legislature-to-hold-right-to-die.php">right-to-die legislation</a> despite the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-woman-in-euthanasia-controversy.php">death of comatose patient Eluana Englaro</a> [JURIST reports] Monday after the removal of her feeding tube last Friday. In November, the Mexican Senate <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/mexico-senate-approves-right-to-die-law.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow terminally ill patients to refuse medical treatment. In 2005, the <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-terri-schiavo-has-died.php">Terri Schiavo case</a> [JURIST report] highlighted similar issues in the United States.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese delegation to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] defended China&#39;s human rights record Monday while presenting a <a href="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_CHN_1_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in compliance with the UNHRC&#39;s <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website] process. Ambassador Li Baodong said that China has been <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/Highlights9February2009am.aspx">taking steps to improve its legal system</a> [press release], promote democracy, and encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The report asserted that<blockquote>[s]ince 1978, when China launched its policy of reform and opening up, there has been a significant advancement in the level and extent of the Chinese people&#8217;s enjoyment of all human rights. The Chinese people, who once lacked basic necessities, are now enjoying relative prosperity. There has been constant progress in such social spheres as education, culture and public health. Democracy and the rule of law have gradually improved. Political restructuring has progressed steadily, with more extensive citizen participation in the political life of the country. Governments at all levels are now conscientiously implementing the Scientific Outlook on Development, an approach that places people first and seeks to ensure comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development, in an effort to build a harmonious society characterized by democracy, the rule of law, equity and justice. China will further deepen its political restructuring and accelerate social development, focusing on education, health care, employment and other aspects of the people&#8217;s welfare in order to ensure that all people enjoy their rights to equal participation and equal development.</blockquote>Although Chinese delegates took a series of questions from delegates from other nations, denying that the government runs secret prisons or engages in torture, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said it did not believe the questioning went far enough. Asia-Pacific Deputy Director at AI Roseann Rife <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/un-misses-opportunity-push-china-human-rights-20090209">said</a> [press release], &quot;We didn&#39;t hear enough about the on-going repression of the Tibetans, the Uighurs, as well as the persecution of various religious groups, including Christians and members of the Falun Gong.&quot;<br /><br />China continues to be widely criticized for its human rights record. In November, the UN <A HREF="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">Committee Against Torture</A> [official website] expressed deep concern over repeated allegations that China authorities continued the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-torture-panel-criticizes-china-human.php">routine and widespread practice of torture</a> [JURIST report] and ill-treatment of suspects to extract confessions. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office of China</a> [official site, in Mandarin] announced that the country would <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/china-announces-human-rights-plan.php">draft a plan to protect human rights</a> [JURIST report]. No information was provided as to when the plan would be released.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Wu Shu-Chen, the wife of former Taiwanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chen+shui-bian">archive</a>], pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of money-laundering and forgery, but denied charges that she embezzled from the presidential state affairs fund. Wu <a href="http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=861939&lang=eng_news&cate_img=83.jpg&cate_rss=news_Politics_TAIWAN">claims the money was a political donation</a> [<em>Taiwan News</em> report], and was not for personal use or bribery. Tuesday marked Wu&#39;s first appearance since she was initially <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/taiwan-first-lady-indicted-on.php">indicted in 2006</a> [JURIST report]. The court had excused her due to health concerns after she collapsed at the onset of the proceedings in 2006. The trial is one of many tied to the administration of the former president, who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] last year by Taiwanese prosecutors on charges including embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering.<br /><br />In addition to charging Wu and Chen, prosecutors have indicted their son and daughter-in-law, three former presidential aides, and eight other associates and family members. Last week, Chen&#39;s sister-in-law <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/taiwan-ex-presidents-associates-plead.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges that she had forged documents and transferred money to bank accounts upon orders from Chen and Wu. Chen has been detained since his <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-arrested-on.php">arrest</a> in November, and last month Taiwan&#39;s High Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">rejected</a> his appeal of the decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-ex-president-appeals-pretrial.php">detain him</a> [JURIST reports] while he awaits trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spain&#39;s <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Sunday unanimously banned the Basque separatist political groups <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetDoc?DBName=dPortal&UniqueKeyValue=70883&Download=false&ShowPath=false">Democracy 3 Million</a> (D3M) and <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetDoc?DBName=dPortal&UniqueKeyValue=70884&Download=false&ShowPath=false">Askatasuna</a> [orders, PDF, in Spanish] from participation in the coming March elections. The court found that Askatasuna was a &quot;fraudulent instrument used to give continuity to the activities of political parties outlawed&quot; such as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3500728.stm">ETA</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=batasuna">news archive</a>]. The court further found that D3M was &quot;directed, produced, energized and encouraged by Batasuna.&quot; The decision of the Supreme Court is <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Supremo/anula/listas/D3M/Askatasuna/ser/fraude/ETA/elpepunac/20090209elpepinac_15/Tes">subject to review</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] by the <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish].<br /><br />In January, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-begins-trial-for-basque.php">filed charges</a> [JURIST report] alleging that the Basque regional prime minister and two other leaders of the Basque socialist party had improper contact with Batasuna, but later requested that the charges be <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-dismisses-case-against.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report]. Last year, a Spanish judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/spain-judge-bars-eta-linked-basque.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the ETA-affiliated groups the <a href="http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/eusk/">Basque Nationalist Action Party</a> (ANV) [party website] and the Communist Party of the Basque Lands (PCTV), finding that Batasuna had used the groups to circumvent its ban from participating in elections. The Spanish government barred the Basque separatist group Batauna in 2003, finding that it refused to cut ties with ETA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://curia.europa.eu/&ei=5veSScn3I4zAMc7voPkL&sa=X&oi=spellmeleon_result&resnum=1&ct=result&cd=1&usg=AFQjCNGKeZ5xilqcya957HmsXhvcy_hQ5w">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-301/06">dismissed a challenge</a> [case materials] to a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006L0024:EN:HTML">directive</a> [EC 2006/24 text] requiring telecommunication companies operating in <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] member countries to retain phone and email data for at least six months. The rule was designed to help law enforcement investigate gang, terrorism and other criminal activity, but Ireland challenged the directive, arguing that the it violates <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] Article 8  privacy protections and was inappropriately based on a section of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E095:EN:HTML">European Community Treaty</a>&nbsp;(ECT) [Article 95 text] designed to facilitate trade rather than combat crime. Addressing only the question of whether the rule was appropriately based on the ECT&#39;s&nbsp;trade&nbsp;provision, the court held that the rule was valid because it standardized costs associated with retaining the data across the EU:<blockquote>As is apparent ... the Community legislature started from the premiss&nbsp;[sic] that there were legislative and technical disparities between the national provisions governing the retention of data by service providers ...<br /><br />... [I]t is apparent that the differences between the various national rules adopted on the retention of data relating to electronic communications were liable to have a direct impact on the functioning of the internal market and that it was foreseeable that that impact would become more serious with the passage of time.<br /><br />Such a situation justified the Community legislature in pursuing the objective of safeguarding the proper functioning of the internal market through the adoption of harmonised rules.</blockquote>Slovakia joined Ireland in the challenge. Spain and the Netherlands joined the EC arguing in support of the directive.<br /><br />The&nbsp;controversial rule was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eu2006.at/en/News/Council_Conclusions/JAISchlussfolgerungen.pdf">approved</a>&nbsp;[press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/eu-ministers-approve-data-retention.php">report</a>]&nbsp;by EU justice and interior ministers in February 2006 after it was&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2005/12/eu-parliament-parties-back-data.php">passed by the European Parliament</a> [JURIST report] in December 2005. Its passage came only after a&nbsp;<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=data+retention+">year and a half of debate</a> [JURIST news archive] among the member states over privacy issues, during which Ireland and Slovakia expressed their intent to challenge the rule.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former British attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4379225.stm">Peter Goldsmith</a> [BBC profile] on Monday&nbsp;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/lord-goldsmith-britain-must-help-out-on-guantanamo-1604515.html">urged</a>&nbsp;[<font class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">Independent</font>&nbsp;op-ed] the UK&nbsp;and other European states to create an &quot;international coalition&quot; to assist the US in closing the&nbsp;<a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facility as soon as possible. Goldsmith said he understands that some countries do not want to accept released detainees, but that he believes a lack of cooperation could prevent the facility from being closed as&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-to-order-guantanamo-closure-in.php">intended</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report].&nbsp;Goldsmith praised <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-open-to-accepting-released.php">Ireland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-will-consider-taking-in.php">other countries</a> for their willingness to accept former prisoners, but called on those who <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/poland-minister-not-eager-to-accept.php">refused or offered only limited assistance</a> [JURIST reports] to reconsider their positions. He added that while the problem may have&nbsp;originated&nbsp;in the US, it could only be solved with the help of other countries:<div><blockquote>Whatever the rights and wrongs of Guantanamo the US was originally responding to an international terrorist threat as well as the need to bring people to justice for killing nearly 3,000 people on 11 September 2001. The means were wrong but the cause was right and past international critics of America&#39;s actions should now do what they can to undo the knot of illegality and shoddy malpractice that traps those still caged at Guantanamo. What&#39;s more, the camp&#39;s continued existence damages us too: as a symbol of the West&#39;s injustice and a recruiting sergeant for terrorism. It&#39;s our problem too. [sic]</blockquote>Last week, the European Parliament&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-parliament-urges-eu-acceptance.php">passed</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//">resolution</a>&nbsp;[text, DOC] encouraging EU member states to accept former detainees for resettlement, and last month several states <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/gena/105561.pdf">indicated willingness</a>&nbsp;[EU press release, JURIST&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eu-member-states-to-consider-accepting.php">report</a>] to consider accepting detainees after safety screenings by the US. On January 22, US President Barack Obama issued an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/gitmo_final_exec_order.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] requiring the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp &quot;as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order.&quot;</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] on Monday ordered a review of all government claims invoking the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive]. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] said that each state secrets claim will be reviewed to make sure the privilege was invoked only in lawful situations. Holder&#39;s announcement came on the same day that the DOJ invoked the state secrets privilege before the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in <u>Mohamed v. Jeppesen</u>, where the plaintiffs are suing a <a href="http://www.boeing.com/">Boeing</a> [corporate website] subsidiary for its alleged role in the US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2009/02/call-to-end-all-renditions.php">Forum</a>] program. The Bush administration previously intervened in the case, asserting the state secrets privilege. During Monday&#39;s oral arguments, the DOJ chose not to change the government&#39;s position. The <a href="http://aclu.org/safefree/torture/38695prs20090209.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/libertyandsecurity/article.cfm?messageID=519&categoryID=3">Constitution Project</a> [press releases]  have expressed disappointment with the DOJ&#39;s decision. ACLU staff attorney Ben Wizner said:<blockquote>We are shocked and deeply disappointed that the Justice Department has chosen to continue the Bush administration&#39;s practice of dodging judicial scrutiny of extraordinary rendition and torture. This was an opportunity for the new administration to act on its condemnation of torture and rendition, but instead it has chosen to stay the course. Now we must hope that the court will assert its independence by rejecting the government&#39;s false claims of state secrets and allowing the victims of torture and rendition their day in court.</blockquote>The state secrets privilege was regularly invoked by the Bush administration to block lawsuits over controversial anti-terrorism programs, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=warrantless+surveillance">warrantless surveillance</a> [JURIST news archive]. In September, a secrecy <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/SecrecyReportCard08.pdf">&quot;report card&quot;</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-government-secrecy-continues-to-rise.php">report</a>] released by <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/">OpenTheGovernment.org</a> [advocacy website] revealed that the Bush administration invoked the state secrets privilege &quot;45 times &#8212; an average of 6.4 times per year in 7 years (through 2007) &#8212; more than double the average (2.46) in the previous 24 years.&quot;

		<title>Senate judiciary chair Leahy calls for &#039;truth commission&#039; to investigate Bush policies</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/sketch08index.html">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profile] Monday called for a South Africa-style <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200902/020909a.html">truth commission</a> [transcript] to investigate controversial actions by the George W. Bush administration, including justifications for the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+war">Iraq war</a>, the treatment of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/detainees.php">military detainees</a>, and the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+wiretapping">warrantless wiretapping</a> [JURIST news archives] program.  Speaking at Georgetown University, Leahy said there was a need to find balance between exposing Bush administration mistakes in order to avoid repeating them, and the desire to move forward rather than cast blame. Leahy suggested that a truth commission could accomplish that goal and that: <blockquote>[Lawmakers] could develop and authorize a person or group of people universally recognized as fair minded, and without axes to grind.  Their straightforward mission would be to find the truth.  People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences, not for purposes of constructing criminal indictments, but to assemble the facts.  If needed, such a process could involve subpoena powers, and even the authority to obtain immunity from prosecutions in order to get to the whole truth. Congress has already granted immunity, over my objection, to those who facilitated warrantless wiretaps and those who conducted cruel interrogations.  It would be far better to use that authority to learn the truth.</blockquote>When asked about Leahy&#39;s proposal, President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] said during a  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/PressConferencebythePresident/">press conference</a> [transcript] late Monday that he had not yet reviewed the plan, but added: &quot;My view is... that nobody&#39;s above the law and, if there are clear instances of wrongdoing, that people should be prosecuted just like any ordinary citizen. But generally speaking, I&#39;m more interested in looking forward than I am in looking backwards.&quot;<br /><br />In January, members of the House Judiciary Committee also <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/house-judiciary-committee-chair-urges.php">called for an investigation</a> into the actions of Bush administration officials, and Obama has said that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-not-ruling-out-prosecution-of.php">would not rule out such an investigation</a> [JURIST reports].  The <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] has <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">alleged</a> [report] that top Bush officials, including former Defense Secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=donald+rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], &#8220;bore major responsibility&#8221; for abuses committed by U.S. interrogators in military detention centers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-874>bill</a> [text] has been introduced into the <a href=http://www.house.gov/>US House of Representatives</a> [official website] that would end the ban on travel by US residents to Cuba. The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act, introduced last week by Representative <a href=http://www.house.gov/delahunt/>William Delahunt</a> (D-MA) [official website], would allow all US citizens and legal residents to visit the island. Exceptions would include instances where the US is at war with Cuba or during times of armed conflict between the countries. The bill, which has been referred to the <a href=http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/>Committee on Foreign Affairs</a> [official website], is sponsored by four Democrats and four Republicans.<br /><br />In 2004, the Bush administration <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2004/02/cuba-travel-restrictions-tightened.htm>tightened travel restrictions to Cuba</a> [JURIST report], invoking its status as a state sponsor of terrorism. Under the current law, US residents may visit relatives on the island once every three years. Residents with no relatives there are generally unable to visit. A <a href=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-721>similar bill</a> [materials] was introduced in the last Congress, but never made it out of committee.

Rehman Malik</a> [official profile], the Advisor on Interior Affairs for the Pakistan <a href="http://www.interior.gov.pk/">Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website]. According to Malik, the perpetrators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/world/asia/13pstan.html?hp">traveled by ship</a> [NYT report] from southern Pakistan to Mumbai, where they launched the attack from inflatable boats using outboard engines purchased in Karachi, Pakistan. Malik also announced that most of the suspects in the attack <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i_THH84S9bUIhGGUr1Hqcm5ssBVAD96A1A7G0">had been arrested</a> [AP report], but more evidence was needed from Indian authorities for further convictions. The Indian <a href="http://meaindia.nic.in/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] said in a <a href="http://meaindia.nic.in/cgi-bin/db2www/meaxpsite/coverpage.d2w/coverpg?sec=pr&filename=pressrelease/2009/02/12pr02.htm">press release</a> [text] Wednesday that the Indian government &quot;...expect[s] that the Government of Pakistan take credible steps to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism in Pakistan.&quot;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/lashkaretaiba.asp">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [ADL backgrounder], the Pakistani group blamed for the attacks, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iazNx59e-BbHT6I_7FBE7LnZfJ3w">denied</a> [AFP report] that a senior member had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123068308893944123.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">confessed to the Pakistani government</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> report] about the group&#39;s involvement. In December, Pakistani officials said they <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/pakistan-refuses-to-hand-over-mumbai.php">would not hand over</a> [JURIST report] to India any Pakistani citizens arrested in connection with the attacks, insisting instead on a joint investigation with Indian officials. Early in December, Pakistani police <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-conspirators-of-mumbai-attacks.php">raided a militant camp</a> [JURIST report] and arrested Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the head of LeT, along with several other individuals believed to be responsible for the attacks. Days after the attacks, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">convened a meeting</a> [JURIST report] of all political parties in order to gather national support for a plan to strengthen security in the country. The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city, including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Shijiazhuang on Thursday declared bankrupt <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/be63a6/shijiazhuang_sanlu">Sanlu Group</a> [Research and Markets profile], the Chinese dairy company at the center of the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=milk+scandal">contaminated milk scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] that killed six and sickened 300,000. As a result of a court order to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-dairy-companies-to-pay-160.php">compensate families</a> [JURIST report] whose children were sickened by the tainted milk, the company borrowed money, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/12/content_10806837.htm">causing its debt to surpass its assets</a> [Xinhua report]. The court order found that because the company had failed to repay debts owed to its 274 creditors, it met the conditions for bankruptcy.<br /><br />The company&#39;s former chairwoman was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-court-sentences-2-to-death-over.php">life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] last month for her involvement in the scandal. She has since <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-dairy-executive-appeals-life.php">appealed the sentence</a> [JURIST report], claiming that it was not she who decided to sell milk with higher levels of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/melamine.html">melamine</a> [FDA backgrounder], but a board member tabbed by New Zealand dairy firm Fonterra, which held a large share in Sanlu Group. More than 17 defendants have faced criminal charges in connection with the contamination. Also last month, lawyers for the families of 213 Chinese children sickened or killed by the contaminated milk <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-lawyers-file-class-action-lawsuit.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> [official website, in Mandarin], China&#39;s highest court, to hear a class action lawsuit against 22 dairy companies involved in the contamination, seeking more than $5 million in damages.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/">Kenyan Parliament</a> [official website] on Tuesday delayed voting on a constitutional amendment that would create a special tribunal for the country, following allegations by MP <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/MPs/tenth_parl/imanyara_g.php">Gitobu Imanyara</a> [official profile] that government officials tried to bribe or blackmail MPs into voting for the bill. <a href="http://statehousekenya.go.ke/">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official website] recently <a href="http://statehousekenya.go.ke/news/feb09/2009100201.htm">made an appeal</a> [press release] for MPs to support the court, which would be responsible for trying those suspected of taking part in violence following the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">disputed December 2007 elections</a> [JURIST report], but groups including the <a href="http://globalministries.org/news/africa/national-council-of-churches.html">National Council of Churches of Kenya</a> [Global Ministries backgrounder] have called for the proposed amendment to be <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Local/Religious-leaders-dare-MPs-over-tribunal-laws-3311.html">heavily scrutinized</a> [Capital News report] in light of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7883143.stm">allegations</a> [BBC report]. Those who oppose creating the special tribunal also argue that the country&#39;s judicial system would not be independent enough to consider the cases properly. Others, including <a href="http://www.icj-kenya.org/">International Commission of Jurists-Kenya</a> [advocacy website], have continued to support its creation. Voting on the amendment has been <a href="http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1144006383&cid=4">postponed</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Standard</font> report] until next week, and if the tribunal does not begin hearings by March 1, a list of suspects will be sent to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for prosecution.<br /><br />Approximately 1,500 people were killed in violence that followed&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] in the country&#39;s presidential election. The disputed tribunal was proposed to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/kenya-election-violence-commission.php">commission</a> [JURIST report] charged with investigating the violence after Kibaki and opposition candidate Raila Odinga approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-parliament-approves-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] designed to quiet the unrest.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv0280-280">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday a petition by two <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees to stop the force-feeding imposed on them during their hunger strike, ruling that the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter. The petitioners, Mohammed Ali Abdullah Bawazir and Omar Khamis Bin Hamdoon, further alleged that their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] rights were being violated because military personnel had begun to administer the feedings rather than medical personnel, and detainees on hunger strike were being denied further medical care until they abandoned the strike. In her memorandum opinion, Judge Gladys Kessler determined that the court lacked jurisdiction under the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/PL-109-366.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], which governs detainees&#39; right to <em>habeas corpus</em>, finding that this aspect of the act was unaffected by the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>]. Kessler also determined that petitioners would most likely be unable to prove that they were treated with deliberate indifference even if the court did not lack jurisdiction. <br /><br />Last month, the US military announced that the Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/guantanamo-hunger-strike-grows-to-42.php">hunger strike has increased to 42 detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Hunger strikes have been an issue at Guantanamo Bay for several years. In January 2007, the number of detainees on strike <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/number-of-hunger-striking-guantanamo.php">more than doubled</a> [JURIST report] as the detention center&#39;s fifth anniversary approached. In September 2005, the number of detainees on <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/gitmo-hunger-strike-gains-momentum.php">strike</a> [JURIST report] was at least 128. After instituting the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/drastic-force-feeding-measures-push.php">force-feeding measures</a> [JURIST report] the number of detainees on strike dwindled to just three or four.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lithuanian <a href=http://www.urm.lt/index.php?-1266332342>Foreign Affairs Minister Vygaudas Usackas</a> [official profile] said Wednesday that the <a href="http://www.urm.lt/index.php?-1480537537">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] will begin talks with the US about the possibility of accepting prisoners from <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Lithuanian <a href="http://www.kam.lt/index.php/en/176088/">Defense Minister Rasa Jukneviciene</a> expects to discuss the matter with US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profiles] during her <a href="http://www.kam.lt/index.php/en/184193/">first diplomatic visit</a> [press release] to the US since the new administration took office. In a <a href=http://www.urm.lt/index.php?1461471832>speech</a> [text] Thursday to the German Society for Foreign Policy, Usackas expressed the need for Europeans to &quot;extend[] a helping hand to the Americans on the closure of Guantanamo.&quot; The <a href="http://vilnius.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy in Lithuania</a> welcomed Usackas&#39;s statements, saying they looked forward to working with the Lithuanian government on plans for closing the prison.<br /><br />Last week, the <a href=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm>European Parliament</a> [official website] voted 542-55, with 51 abstentions, to <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/shotlist_page/20090204SHL48380/default_sl.htm">adopt a resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/02/europe-parliament-urges-eu-acceptance.php>report</a>] calling for member states to accept low-risk prisoners who cannot be returned to their countries of origin for fear of persecution. Details regarding which prisoners may be transferred to which countries are as yet undetermined. Last month, Council of the European Union Secretary-General <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/index.asp?cmsid=246&lang=EN">Javier Solana</a> [official website] indicated that several EU member states would likely be <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/gena/105561.pdf">willing to accept</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eu-member-states-to-consider-accepting.php">report</a>] some former prisoners, though acceptance may be conditioned on the US providing careful background checks to prove that the detainees pose no danger to the host country. French Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/ministry_158/ministers_1903/bernard-kouchner_5617/index.html">Bernard Kouchner</a> [official profile] has noted that legal obstacles facing the transfer of the detainees would be different for each host country, and that their acceptance would be determined on a case-by case basis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Tibetan courts have convicted 76 people involved in the <a href="http://www.freetibet.org/support/tibetan-uprising-2008">March 2008 Lhasa riots</a> [Free Tibet backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=march+tibet+demonstrations">news archive</a>], according to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/11/content_10798392.htm">official remarks</a> [Xinhua report] on Tuesday by vice-president of the Tibet regional People&#39;s Congress Nyima Cering. The high ranking Tibetan official did not discuss sentence terms at the press conference, part of a state sponsored tour of the region for foreign media. Non Gyal, a monk who interrupted a press conference one year ago to tell the foreign media that the government was lying to them about the aftermath of the riots, was also present. He described his prior statements as misguided, and said that he had suffered no repercussions after the riots.<br /><br />The March 2008 riots coincided with Olympic Games publicity in the region and the anniversary celebration of the failed Tibetan uprising against China. At least 18 people died and 1200 were arrested, but several reports allege much higher numbers. China is wary of disturbances in this year&#39;s 50th anniversary celebrations, only a month away, and already there are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iAMqM2_Dwudz52KLQeY2ZKFQq9-gD95VVR680">reports</a> [AP report] that 81 people in Tibet have been detained for alleged criminal activity. In November 2008, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">UN Committee Against Torture</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/43C80DA746870C23C1257508003AC7C6?OpenDocument">recommended</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-torture-panel-criticizes-china-human.php">report</a>] that China ensure prompt access to an independent lawyer, independent medical care, and the right to lodge confidential complaints for all persons detained in connection with the March 2008 riots.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive] insurgents on Wednesday targeted the Afghan <a href="http://www.moj.gov.af/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website], the Prisons Directorate and other government buildings in coordinated attacks in the capital city of Kabul. Early estimates reported 28 killed and more than 60 injured. At least five gunmen stormed the Justice Ministry, several outfitted with explosive devices that apparently did not detonate. A Taliban spokesperson reportedly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gdQVAWJ3TP4PCpGUsKanrVbyhU6A">confirmed that 16 insurgents had been deployed</a> [AFP report] to the city in response to the alleged mistreatment of Taliban prisoners. At least eight attackers, including two suicide bombers, were killed. The attacks came one day before the <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/peacesec-english/2009/February/20090204143511dmslahrellek0.5296289.html">scheduled visit</a> [DOS press release] of US Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/01/115297.htm">Richard Holbrooke</a> [appointment transcript], an information-gathering trip set to focus on expanding security in Afghanistan.  <br /><br />Although this is the first major Taliban attack on the Justice Ministry building, judges and detention have previously been targeted. In September, Central Narcotics Tribunal Appeals Court Judge Alim Hanif was <a href="http://afghandevnews.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/afghan-anti-drug-judge-shot-killed/">killed in Kabul</a> [UPI report]. In early August, a <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gORZYyo7Ziz0KmlKbHoeNaQVzJKQ">judge in southern Helmand province</a> [AFP report] and the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-08/2008-08-07-voa15.cfm?CFID=115155558&CFTOKEN=16954162&jsessionid=de3020a2800db58721eb7c614f1f5617c6e5">chief judge of Khost province</a> [VOA report] were shot and killed by unidentified gunmen said to be connected to the Taliban. In June, approximately <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/afghan-prison-break-frees-over-800.php">870 inmates escaped</a> [JURIST report] from the main prison in Kandahar City in southern Afghanistan when members of the Taliban conducted a bomb and rocket attack on the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Information redacted from a British High Court <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/judgments_guidance/mohamed-judgment4-04022009.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-juges-reveal-us-threatened-to.php">report</a>] released last week has been withheld from US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] and may hold key information about British involvement in the alleged torture of <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [Reprieve profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=binyam+mohamed">news archive</a>], according to a <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2009/02/11/CSSlettertoObama.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent by Mohamed&#39;s lawyer to Obama. The letter, sent Monday by <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] director <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/staff_clivestaffordsmith.htm">Clive Stafford Smith</a> [Reprieve profile], was accompanied by an attachment purporting to demonstrate the extent to which the information presented to Obama by the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] has been censored. According to Smith, the censored information would reveal the &quot;truly medieval ways&quot; in which Mohamed was tortured and reflect &quot;specific admissions by his abusers.&quot; Smith urged Obama to order the DOD to disclose the evidence, which may have been withheld in order to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/11/binyam-mohamed-release-torture-letter">protect the president politically</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. On Tuesday, the two British judges who authored last week&#39;s decision agreed to reopen the case after Mohamed&#39;s lawyers challenged the order that the torture evidence remain classified. UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/how-we-are-organised/ministers/d-miliband">David Miliband</a> [official profile], who has <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-foreign-minister-denies-court-claim.php">denied claims</a> [JURIST report] that US pressure led to the censoring of released information in Mohamed&#39;s case, confirmed Wednesday that British diplomats have been given permission to visit him in Guantanamo. The delegation, to be accompanied by a British police doctor, is to prepare for Mohamed&#39;s return to Britain pending review by the Obama administration. <br /><br />At issue in Mohamad&#39;s case were several paragraphs describing the conditions and circumstances of his imprisonment, redacted from the High Court&#39;s judgment in its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-high-court-rules-foreign-office-must.php">August 2008 ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the UK Foreign Office must turn over evidence essential to Mohamed&#39;s defense. Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. He was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, he <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">asked the UK government</a> [letter, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">report</a>] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] FBI Deputy Director <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/pistole.htm">John Pistole</a> [official profile] said Wednesday the FBI is looking at shifting a number of agents from national security and counterterrorism activities to investigations involving financial fraud, during a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3651">hearing</a> [materials; <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/webcast/judiciary02112009-1000.ram">video</a>] before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website]. Pistole <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3651&wit_id=7603">said</a> [prepared testimony] there are currently more than 1600 ongoing mortgage fraud investigations, along with more than 530 corporate fraud investigations, 38 of which are &quot;directly related to the current financial crisis.&quot; While Pistole said the number of special agents working on fraud cases increased to 180 in 2008 from 120 in 2007, he compared the numbers to the savings and loans crisis of the late 1980s, during which about 1,000 agents were assigned. <br /><br />As of September, the FBI was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-investigating-major-financial.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml">Fannie Mae</a>, <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.lehman.com/">Lehman Brothers</a>, and <a href="http://www.aig.com/Home-Page_20_17084.html">AIG</a> [corporate websites], along with 22 other financial institutions, for possible <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/mortgage_fraud.htm">mortgage fraud</a> [FBI backgrounder]. In June, the FBI announced that <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mortgagefraud061908.htm">more than 400 people had been indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/fbi-names-more-than-400-in-mortgage.php">report</a>] in connection to what has been termed the US &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot; The vast majority of the indictments involved fraud related to individual mortgages, with the FBI focusing on lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes, which account for more than $1 billion in losses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] on Thursday rejected arguments made in three test cases against the US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website; HHS <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/02/20090212a.html">statement</a>] by families alleging that their children&#39;s autism was caused by a combination of common childhood vaccines. Due to the case volume and complexity of the so-called <a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Background_on_the_autism_proceedings.pdf">Omnibus Autism Proceeding</a> [court backgrounder, PDF; HRSA <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/omnibusproceeding.htm">backgrounder</a>], the court ordered separate trials based on three distinct theories of liability under the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> [HRSA backgrounder], and in 2007 court-appointed special masters began hearing three test cases for each theory.  Thursday&#39;s judgments roundly rejected the first theory of liability, that the <a href="http://cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/combo-vaccines/mmr/faqs-mmr-hcp.htm">Measles, Mumps, and Rubella combination vaccine</a> (MMR) [CDC backgrounder] vaccines and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimfaq.htm">thimerosal-containing vaccines</a> [FDA backgrounder] can combine to cause autism. In <a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf">Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> [opinion, PDF], a special master held that the evidence presented was &quot;overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners&#8217; contentions&quot; and that the Cedillo family failed to demonstrate that the vaccinations at issue played any role in the child&#39;s autism.  In <a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf">Hazlehurst v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> [opinion, PDF], the special master held that the combination of the thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine are not causal factors in the development of autism, and could not have contributed to the development of autism.  In <a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Vowell.Snyder.pdf">Snyder v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</a> [opinion, PDF], a third special master held that the Vowell family failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that their child&#39;s autism was caused or significantly aggravated by a vaccine, adding that it was &quot;abundantly clear that petitioners&#8217; theories of causation were speculative and unpersuasive.&quot; All plaintiffs have indicated that they will appeal the decisions. Special masters will continue to hear three cases on a second theory of liability - that thimerosal-containing vaccines alone can cause autism - with judgments expected this summer. Cases testing the final theory of HHS liability - that MMR vaccines alone can cause autism - have been dropped.  <br /><br />Thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, has been at the center of several health debates. In 2005, HHS officials said that <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/health-officials-warn-state.php">state laws prohibiting thimerosal could impede efforts</a> [JURIST report] to fight an avian flu pandemic should an outbreak occur. Most doctors believe thimerosal is safe, saying it does not affect the body in the same manner as mercury found in pollutants, but several groups claim that use of the preservative can be linked to neurological diseases including autism. Creation of mercury-free vaccines requires packaging individual doses, which is expected to pose a major problem if large batches of the vaccine need to be rushed in the event of an avian flu pandemic. Doctors partially attribute <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aiiTybT70ojc&refer=us">recent outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases</a> [Bloomberg report] in the US to an increasing reluctance among parents to expose children to vaccines.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] spokesperson Robert Wood on Tuesday <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2009/02/116495.htm">defended the silence of the US delegates</a> [press conference transcript] during the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [materials] of potential rights abuses, saying that the US is not actively participating&nbsp;because the administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;[official website] is still deciding how it wants to interact with the Council. Wood said that the US had representatives attending and monitoring the UPR sessions, and that its abstention from the reviews did not mean that human rights were not a priority for the administration. He also said that <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] intends to address the rights records of China and Indonesia in an upcoming trip to Asia:<blockquote>[F]or one, we&#39;re reviewing our policy and strategy with regard to the Human Rights Council. Certainly, I can understand many people want to see us enunciate our policies very early on. You know, it does take time. We want to make sure that we&#8217;ve done a thorough review and that we not rush this. We want to get it right.&nbsp;Let me just be very clear: With this President and this Secretary, human rights is a very, very high priority. We&#8217;re very concerned &#8211; we&#8217;ve been very concerned about the operation of the Human Rights Council, and we want to take a look and see how we may engage with the Human Rights Council. But this is all part of the review, and as soon as we have completed that review, we will certainly make clear what our policies are. ...<br /><br />[O]n this trip, human rights is going to be an important issue. The Secretary will raise the issue, when appropriate, where she thinks she can have the most effect, and you can count on that. I don&#8217;t think anybody is going to be able to tell you exactly, well, in this particular meeting, you know, the Secretary is going to raise issue X or Y. She is going to do what she thinks is best in terms of trying to communicate our goals and objectives on the human rights front, and you can rest assured that this is an issue that she cares deeply about and that will come up on this &#8211; during this visit. And she will raise it, as I said, in an appropriate time.</blockquote>Wood&#39;s statements come after the administration has received criticism from both human rights groups and US politicians for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/02/116401.htm">not taking part</a>&nbsp;[press release]&nbsp;in the UPR sessions. In his <a href="http://wolf.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=34&parentid=6&sectiontree=6,34&itemid=1290">remarks on the decision</a> [press release], US Representative Frank Wolf (R-VA) criticized the administration for failing to use the UPR process to address abuses it has long condemned:<blockquote>The United Nations Human Rights Council is now conducting reviews of the human rights records of 16 countries-among which are China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Russia.<br /><br />While the United States is not a member of the Human Rights Council, every member of the U.N. has an opportunity to pose questions and raise concerns about the human rights record of the country being reviewed.<br /><br />I was shocked and disappointed to learn that for the last week, the U.S. delegation has been silent. How can America be say nothing about four of the worst offenders of human rights and religious freedom in the world? ... <br /><br />This administration made a pledge to place human rights at the top of its agenda. The administration is off to the wrong start on making human rights a priority.</blockquote>China, the subject of one of the reviews, defended itself in a&nbsp;<a href="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_CHN_1_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-defends-rights-record-in-review.php">report</a>] to the UPR earlier this month, saying that it was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/Highlights9February2009am.aspx">taking steps to improve its legal system</a> [press release], promote democracy, and encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

The outline, laid out at a <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/585858">news conference</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> report] in Toronto, calls for assessments of the 22-year-old&#39;s health and education, and proposes he be housed in a foster home. Dennis Edney, one of Khadr&#39;s lawyers, called on Canadian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/pm.asp?featureId=7">Stephen Harper</a> [official profile] to press for a repatriation plan when he meets with visiting US President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] in Ottawa on February 19.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] announced Thursday that the ICC <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/no%20decision%20concerning%20possible%20arrest%20warrant%20against%20president%20al%20bashir%20of%20sudan">has not issued an arrest warrant</a> [press release] for Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">President Omar Al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>], refuting Wednesday <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html?ref=world">reports</a> [NYT report] that the warrant had been issued. The Wednesday reports, allegedly based on statements by an anonymous UN diplomat, said that the ICC had reached a decision on the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">July 2008 request</a> [JURIST report] by chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] to issue an arrest warrant against Bashir. The ICC stressed that any announcement of a decision to issue an arrest warrant would come in &quot;the normal way of a press release and publication on the Court&#8217;s website.&quot;<br /><br />On Tuesday, UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon made <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1264">statements</a> [press conference transcript, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-sg-urges-bashir-to-comply-with.php">report</a>] emphasizing the independent nature of the ICC as a judiciary organization, and stressing that Bashir should &quot;fully cooperate with whatever decisions the ICC makes.&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> [JURIST reports] have both asked the UN Security Council to delay war crime charges against Bashir for one year by invoking <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/keydocuments/english/romestatuteofthe7.html#c28">Article 16 of the Rome Statute</a> [text], citing fears that an arrest warrant would disrupt the Sudanese peace process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugolavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tdec/fr/090211.pdf">indefinitely suspended</a> [decision, PDF, in French; ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10051">press release</a>] the trial of <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/seselj/4">Volislav Seselj</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=seselj">news archive</a>] over fears that witnesses were being intimidated. Seselj, leader of the ultranationalist <a href="http://www.srs.org.yu/">Serbian Radical Party</a> (SRS) [party website, in Serbian], is <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-remdamdi070329.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes, and is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict. The 2-1 ruling came in response to a motion filed by prosecutors last month, in which they <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/trans/en/090115ED.htm">argued</a> [court transcripts] there was &quot;clear and convincing evidence that going forward will compromise the integrity and fairness of the proceedings.&quot; Chief Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti dissented because the prosecution has only a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jokxsgPNzqV7Y7FAX7TvV0FTmnngD969FPBO1">limited amount of evidence</a> [AP report] left to present.<br /><br />Last month the ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/tdec/en/090121.pdf">charged</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/icty-charges-seselj-with-contempt-for.php">report</a>] Seselj with contempt of court after it was alleged that he authored a book revealing pertinent information about several key witnesses. It was the second contempt charge brought in the ICTY&#39;s trial of Seselj. In September, key witness <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/cis-petkovic.pdf">Ljubisa Petkovic</a> [ICTY materials, PDF] was found <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1282e-summary.htm">guilty of contempt</a> [judgment summary; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-finds-uncooperative-witness-guilty.php">report</a>] for refusing to testify against Seselj. In August, the ICTY <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2008/pb080827.htm">suspended</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icty-adjourns-serb-nationalist-leaders.php">report</a>] Seselj&#39;s trial pending an appellate ruling on whether the defendant could represent himself. The ICTY had previously <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/serb-nationalist-war-crimes-defendant_27.php">stripped Seselj of his right to defend himself</a> [JURIST report] after he failed to appear in court, despite an earlier appeals court ruling that he <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/icty-appeals-panel-rules-serb.php">could represent himself</a> [JURIST report] provided he did not engage in courtroom behavior that &quot;substantially obstruct[ed] the proper and expeditious proceedings in his case.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-bashir">news archive</a>] must <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1264">cooperate with any indictment or decision</a> [press conference transcript] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] may issue against him, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] said Tuesday. On Monday, Ban had a rare meeting with Bashir at a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29847&Cr=darfur&Cr1=">UN-African Union summit</a> [UN News Centre report], where Ban urged Bashir to heed any ICC decisions and protect the 20,000 UN peacekeepers located throughout Sudan from public backlash. Speaking at a press conference in New York on Tuesday, Ban said:<blockquote>Whatever the circumstances or decisions of the ICC may be, it will be very important for President Bashir and the Sudanese Government to react very responsibly and ensure the safety and security of the United Nations peacekeepers, and protect the human rights of all the population there, and also faithfully implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. And he should fully cooperate with whatever decisions that the ICC makes. This is a very important fundamental principle that he should take.</blockquote> ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">sought an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Bashir on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur, and the ICC is expected to decide whether to issue the warrant as early as this month.<br /><br />Last week, Sudan and the African Union <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">reissued a request to the UN Security Council</a> [JURIST report] to delay for one year any ICC indictment for Bashir. Under <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/keydocuments/english/romestatuteofthe7.html#c28">Article 16 of the Rome Statute</a> [text], the UN may pass a resolution that defers a prosecution in the ICC for 12 months. The African Union fears that an indictment would <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">pose a threat to the peace process</a> [JURIST report] in the Sudan. Ban has previously expressed concern that an arrest warrant for Bashir would create an unfavorable Sudanese reaction, with his latest <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2009/61">report</a> [text; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29792&Cr=sudan&Cr1=cpa">report</a>] stating a fear that the Sudanese government &quot;may redefine its relationship with UNMIS (the UN Mission in Sudan that is mainly concerned with helping to enforce the CPA) should an arrest warrant be issued against President al-Bashir.&quot; A Security Council resolution staying the ICC&#39;s indictment would require a majority of nine votes and the concurring votes of all five permanent members.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_L11_CHN_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] issued Wednesday by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] commended China&#39;s developmental progress, while urging the nation to share best practices in poverty reduction and to improve the national standard of living. The report follows China&#39;s evaluation under the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website] process adopted by the UN in 2006, which aims to review the human rights records of every UN member country by 2011. Although supporting the majority of recommendations submitted by reviewing nations, China rejected suggestions that it abolish or reduce its application of the death penalty, ensure religious freedom, eliminate administrative detention in labor camps, and ratify the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. Speaking at a Thursday <a href="http://big5.fmprc.gov.cn/gate/big5/www1.fmprc.gov.cn/chn/xwfw/fyrth/t475741.htm">press conference</a> [transcript, in Mandarin], Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Jiang Yu said that<blockquote>the overwhelming majority of countries submitted a positive evaluation of China&#39;s human rights policies and achievements, but also continue to support China&#39;s national conditions suitable to their own development path. A small number of countries will be considered to have made an attempt to politicize the work of the Chinese side and make unjustified accusations that were refuted in most countries.</blockquote><a href="http://crd-net.org">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> [advocacy website, in Mandarin], a human rights activist group, <a href="http://crd-net.org/Article/Class9/Class10/200902/20090213000705_13642.html">expressed concern</a> [press release] over China&#39;s &quot;dismissive attitude toward critical comments&quot; and &quot;the general unwillingness of most member states to confront the human rights records of the Chinese government.&quot; <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/04/17/un-mixed-results-new-review-process">criticized the UPR process generally</a> [press release], saying that the proceedings where &quot;marked by excessive praise and timid criticisms.&quot;<br /><br />China <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-defends-rights-record-in-review.php">defended its human rights record</a> [JURIST report] before the UNHRC on Monday, noting that it has been taking steps to improve its legal system, promote democracy, and encourage non-governmental organizations. On Tuesday, the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-defends-silence.php">defended the silence of the US delegation</a> [JURIST report] during the proceedings, saying that the administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] is still deciding how it wants to interact with the UNHRC. Despite the relatively positive report, China continues to be widely criticized for its human rights record. In November, the <A HREF="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">UN Committee Against Torture</A> [official website] expressed deep concern over repeated allegations that China authorities continued the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-torture-panel-criticizes-china-human.php">routine and widespread practice of torture</a> [JURIST report] and ill-treatment of suspects to extract confessions. Earlier that month, China&#39;s <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office</a> [official site, in Mandarin] announced that the country would <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/china-announces-human-rights-plan.php">draft a plan to protect human rights</a> [JURIST report]. No information was provided as to when the plan would be released.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian human rights group the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] announced Thursday that the number of Russian hate crimes rose slightly in 2008 over 2007 levels, with 97 people killed and 525 wounded. According to the deputy head of SOVA Galina Kozhevnikova <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hQyFVMvt2G7CzJcMjcYSqEyiLUGAD969FG3O1">higher conviction rates for hate crimes</a> [AP report] prevented the numbers of hate crimes from rising any higher. The release of the SOVA Center report comes just days after Kozhevnikova received an e-mailed death threat from a neo-Nazi group. In response, the <a href="http://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website] called on Russian authorities to <a href="http://cpj.org/2009/02/neo-nazis-threaten-to-murder-journalists-in-russia.php">launch an immediate investigation</a> [CPJ press release] into the threats. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/02/10/russia-migrant-construction-workers-face-serious-abuses">report</a> [HRW press release] outlining the dangers faced by Russian migrant workers in a climate of rising xenophobia.<br /><br />Last January, the SOVA Center reported a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/russia-hate-crimes-up-13-percent-in.php">13 percent rise in hate crimes from 2007 to 2008</a> [JURIST report]. Kozhevnikova criticized Russian authorities at the time for not responding to the increase in violence, saying that many hate crimes were only prosecuted as incidents of hooliganism, which would carry a lighter sentence than hate crimes. In June 2007, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/hate-crimes-on-rise-in-europe-rights.php">hate crimes are on the rise throughout Europe</a> [JURIST report], after conducting a study examining recent hate crimes in France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. That study found a &quot;proliferation of violent hate crimes directed against ethnic, religious and national minorities&quot; in Russia especially.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Obama administration official said Friday that a review of detainees, the first step in closing the prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gitmo14-2009feb14,0,1394765.story">begun</a> [<em>Los Angeles Times</em> report]. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] issued the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Review_of_Detention_Policy_Options/">executive order</a> [text] last month that initiated the review process. The order called for the review to be conducted by a &quot;Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition,&quot; which includes US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] as co-chairs. The review is intended to determine the options available in regards to the prosecution, transfer, or other dispositions of detainees, along with providing an assessment of detention policies. <br /><br />On the same day as the executive order for review, Obama issued the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing that the military prison be closed &quot;as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order.&quot; The order also instructed Gates immediately to halt <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">news archive</a>] proceedings pending a comprehensive review of all Guantanamo detentions under the supervision of the Attorney General. The order did not specify where detainees would go upon release, but it did call for diplomatic efforts with foreign states in order to facilitate the closure of the facility.

The EC&#39;s report commended initial efforts, such as the drafting of amendments to the Criminal and Civil Codes, but noted that Romania has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/02/12/europe/EU-EU-Romania-Bulgaria.php">regressed</a> [<em>International Herald Tribune</em> report] in recent months, with &quot;investigations into some high-level corruption cases remain[ing] blocked by the Romanian Parliament.&quot; Romania&#39;s next evaluation is scheduled to occur sometime this summer.<br /><br />The EC has previously chastised both Romania and Bulgaria for failing to make judicial reforms, permitting corruption, and for falling short in efforts to combat organized crime. These issues were addressed in the nations&#39; <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/news/external_relations/080724_1_en.htm">July 2008</a> [EC report] evaluations and their <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/eu-says-bulgaria-romania-must-do-more.php">June 2007</a> [JURIST report] progress reports.  The two nations <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/germany-promises-to-put-constitution.php">joined the EU</a> [JURIST report] in January 2007 after six years of negotiations, at which time they were given benchmarks for implementing the rule of law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An appeals court in Afghanistan on Sunday upheld a lower court&#39;s decision to sentence two men convicted of translating the Koran to 20 years in prison. The three-judge panel <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hITyqVOjG08VRKlLCe5j7Wx4nhCQD96CBUNO0">ruled</a> [AP report] that the men were guilty of modifying the Koran, but did not issue the maximum punishment of death. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+clerics">Muslim clerics</a> [JURIST news archive] viewed the free distribution of the translated Koran as blasphemous, and have been calling for the execution of Ahmad Ghaws Zalmai, a former spokesman for the attorney general, and Mushtaq Ahmad, a Muslim cleric who signed a letter endorsing the translation, since their arrest in 2007. The court based its decision on Islamic Shariah law, highlighting the lack of secular statutes for the court to consider, and providing another example of the influence clerics have in the Afghan legal system. Zalmai&#39;s attorney indicated that both men plan to appeal to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.af/">Supreme Court of Afghanistan</a> [official website].<br /><br />The Afghan justice system continues to be viewed as a target for the country&#39;s rebel leaders, putting pressure on judges to act in their favor. Last week, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive] insurgents <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/afghan-justice-ministry-attacked-by.php">targeted</a> [JURIST report] the Afghan <a href="http://www.moj.gov.af/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website], the Prisons Directorate, and other government buildings in Kabul. In October, an Afghan appeals court <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27297183/">sentenced</a> [AP report] a journalism student to 20 years for asking questions about women&#39;s rights under Islam. Muslim clerics considered the acts blasphemous, and conducted public demonstrates because the student violated the tenets of Islam. In September, Central Narcotics Tribunal Appeals Court Judge Alim Hanif was <a href="http://afghandevnews.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/afghan-anti-drug-judge-shot-killed/">killed in Kabul</a> [UPI report]. In early August, a judge in <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gORZYyo7Ziz0KmlKbHoeNaQVzJKQ">southern Helmand province</a> [AFP report] and the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-08/2008-08-07-voa15.cfm?CFID=115155558&CFTOKEN=16954162&jsessionid=de3020a2800db58721eb7c614f1f5617c6e5">chief judge of Khost province</a> [VOA report] were shot and killed by unidentified gunmen said to be connected to the Taliban.

		<title>Ohio court enjoins NCAA rule prohibiting legal representation for amateur athletes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the Erie County Court of Common Pleas in Ohio <a href="/pdf/ncaa.pdf">issued a permanent injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday against a <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) [official website] bylaw that restricted the eligibility of student baseball players who were assisted by legal counsel during negotiations with professional baseball clubs. The case, <u>Oliver v. NCAA</u>, concerned an Ohio resident playing collegiate baseball at <a href="http://www.okstate.edu/">Oklahoma State University</a> (OSU) [official website] who had been drafted but never signed with the <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=min">Minnesota Twins</a> [official website] Major League Baseball franchise. The bylaw affected collegiate baseball players who were drafted by <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) [official website] teams prior to enrolling in college, and who hired attorneys to represent them during negotiations between the drafted player and the MLB team. According to the bylaw, the player&#39;s status as an amateur athlete would not be negatively impacted by lawyer&#39;s representation, provided that the lawyer did not directly participate in the negotiations. The court granted a permanent injunction against the NCAA bylaw, holding that it is arbitrary and capricious and against public policy because it interfered with and limited the player&#39;s ability to negotiate a contract effectively. In finding for the plaintiff, Judge Tygh Tone wrote:<blockquote>The process advanced by the NCAA hinders representation provided by legal counsel creating an atmosphere fraught with ethical dilemmas and pitfalls that an attorney consulting a student-athlete must encounter. Will the attorney be able to advance what is best for the client or will a neutral party, the NCAA, tie his hands? What harm could possibly befall the student-athlete if such a rule were not found? What occurs if the parents of a student are attorneys or for that matter sports agents? What would have happened if Tim Baratta [the lawyer hired by the plaintiff] had been in the kitchen or outside or on the patio instead of in the same room as his client when the offer from the Minnesota Twins was made to Plaintiff?<br /><br />This Court appreciates that a fundamental goal of the member institutions and the Defendant is to preserve the clear line of demarcation between amateurism and professionalism. However, to suggest that Bylaw 12.3.2.1 accomplishes that purpose by instructing a student-athlete that his attorney cannot do what he was [sic] hired him or her to do, is simply illegitimate.</blockquote>The NCAA <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/sports/baseball/13ncaa.html">indicated in a statement</a> [NYT report] that it would appeal Thursday&#39;s ruling to a higher court.<br /><br />Judge Tone&#39;s ruling in Oliver v. NCAA could have significant impact on both collegiate baseball and the signing of drafted players by professional clubs, as well as the NCAA&#39;s overarching player-eligibility scheme. Currently, many high school players attempt to negotiate professional contracts without the substantial assistance of legal advisers in order to maintain NCAA eligibility. The repeal of the NCAA bylaw could lead to an increase in the number of drafted amateur players signing professional contracts immediately after high school due to the assistance of legal counsel in the negotiating process. Such an increase would also lead to a decreasing number of high-quality amateur baseball players enrolling in NCAA collegiate baseball programs. Unlike student-athletes in other NCAA sports, baseball players are eligible to be drafted <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/more/02/12/ncaa.lawsuit.ap/index.html?eref=si_more">after graduating from high school</a> [AP report].

Last week, Moreno-Ocampo announced that PNA president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1933453.stm">Mahmoud Abbas</a> [BBC profile] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-weigh-palestinian-authority.php">petitioned the court to exercise jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over possible war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip, but indicated the tribunal would first have to consider whether the PNA qualifies for statehood under international law before addressing the allegations. If the ICC finds that it has jurisdiction, the prosecutor must make a preliminary finding that there is <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Investigations/">a reasonable basis to believe</a> [ICC backgrounder] that a crime within the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction has been committed.<br /><br />Under the ICC&#39;s <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], jurisdiction in a matter can only be transferred to the court when it involves a recognized, signatory state, or by special approval of <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website]. Israel, the country generally considered to possess the Gaza Strip, does not recognize the court. Moreno-Ocampo previously said that the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/icc-has-no-jurisdiction-to-investigate.php">lacked jurisdiction over the alleged crimes</a>, but then indicated last Monday that the court was nonetheless <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-prosecutor-reviewing-options-for.php">making a &quot;preliminary analysis&quot;</a> [JURIST report] of the situation. Israel has already begun to consider <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">defenses against possible war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report], partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST report] by groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] that it used <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/wp.htm">white phosphorus</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in a civilian area.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/default.asp">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website] party treasurer general Roy Bennett has been indicted on terrorism and other charges, a lawyer for Bennett said Sunday. Bennett, who was scheduled to be sworn in as deputy agriculture minister in the country&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7860161.stm">new coalition government</a> [BBC report]  last week, is accused of funding the purchase of fire arms and explosives intended to be used as part of an insurgency. The MDC has criticized Bennett&#39;s Friday arrest, which they <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/pressbody.asp?pressid=65">characterized as an abduction</a> [press release], and there has been speculation that it could cause increased friction between the MDC and the <a href="http://www.zanupfpub.co.zw/">African National Union-Patriotic Front</a> (ZANU-PF) [party website] party of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>]. The two groups entered into a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in September of last year in an effort to end violence following the country&#39;s hotly <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+election">contested presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. Bennett had originally faced treason charges, but they <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/PrintEdition/News/Article.aspx?id=939525">were dropped</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> report] in favor of the terrorism and other charges. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.<br /><br />Bennett&#39;s arrest came shortly after he <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20090130112041597C347722">returned to Zimbabwe</a> [IOL report] for the first time in five years. After being imprisoned in 2004 for participation in an alleged assassination attempt on Mugabe, Bennett&nbsp;sought political asylum in South Africa. In 2006, prosecutors  of an <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-15-for-plotting.php">alleged coup plot</a> [JURIST report] against Mugabe also sought Bennett for questioning, but is not clear whether the current indictment is for those or separate charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caed/staticOther/page_455.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://sexcrimes.typepad.com/files/valverde-opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] this week that the <a href="www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/sorna_faqs.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [DOJ backgrounder, PDF], which makes it a federal crime for a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sex+offender">sex offender</a> [JURIST news archive] to attempt to move to another state while failing to register in a nationwide database, is unconstitutional. In the cases of Mark Anthony Valverde, and Nedde Max Murphy Jr., Judge Lawrence Karlton <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/topstories/story/1624578.html">held</a> [Sacramento Bee report] that the statute violates the <a href="http://www.house.gov/house/Constitution/Constitution.html">Commerce Clause</a> [US Constitution Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 text] of the US Constitution. Valverde had pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges in 2002 in California, and after being paroled in 2008, he was arrested when he fled to Montana before registering as a sex offender. In his order dismissing Valverde&#39;s indictment, Karlton relied in part on the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] cases of <u>United States v. Lopez</u> and <u>United States v. Morrison</u>, saying:<blockquote>[Section] 2250 does possess a purportedly jurisdictional element, as it penalizes a person who is required to register under SORNA and knowingly fails to do so or to update his or her registration and who travels in interstate commerce. In this way, unlike the statutes considered in Lopez and Morrison, the section limits the class of those who can be penalized to only those who have traveled in interstate commerce. The problem, however, is that this jurisdictional hook still creates a class that is too broad for Commerce Clause purposes. <br /><br />Under the statute, a person may be prosecuted for failing to register in his home state, then crossing state lines and registering in the next state. The harm, therefore, may be entirely intrastate. Were this a sufficient jurisdictional element, there would be no limit to Congress&#8217;s ability to penalize any crime whatsoever, so long as the defendant at some point in the course of his life traveled across state lines. This appears to be a plain usurpation of the state&#8217;s police power; as the Court expressed in Morrison, there is &#8220;no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.&#8221; As such, the jurisdictional language in [Section] 2250 cannot alone render the statute valid under the Commerce Clause.</blockquote>While the ruling is the minority position concerning SORNA, other District Courts have also found the statute unconstitutional on Commerce Clause grounds, including the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of Florida</a> [official website; NSCLC blog <a href="http://www.nsclc.org/areas/federal-rights/area_folder.2006-05-26.6012943467/s-d-fla-fourth-court-holds-registration-law-violates-commerce-clause/article_view">report</a>] and the <a href="http://www.nynd.uscourts.gov/">Northern District of New York</a> [official website; NSCLC blog <a href="http://www.nsclc.org/areas/federal-rights/area_folder.2006-05-26.6012943467/n-d-n-y-another-commerce-clause-ruling-against-sorna">report</a>].  Sex offender laws have been increasingly <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-sex-offender-laws-may-do-more-harm.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] for limiting residence options and for promoting ostracization.

The report calls for the Cambodian government and others to address &quot;grave flaws&quot; in the tribunal, suggesting that the government may be blocking further indictments of former senior members of Khmer Rouge.  The ECCC plans to try as many as <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">eight suspects</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the regime but is urged by the report to &quot;show it is relying on law and facts, not politics, in deciding how many suspects will be investigated.&quot; The Duch case is the first to reach the trial stage.<br /><br />UN and Cambodian officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/anti-corruption-measures-needed-to.php">called for anti-corruption measures</a> [JURIST report] in December after allegations were made of kickbacks for judicial appointments.

Odinga said he had discussed the situation with mediator <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Koffi Annan</a> [official profile] and remained hopeful that lawmakers would establish a Special Tribunal. The <a href="http://www.cipev.org/home.asp">Commission of Inquiry on Post Election Violence</a> (CIPEV), or Waki Commission, has set a March 1 deadline for the creation of a tribunal, after which a list of 10 high-ranking officials accused of orchestrating the violence is to be delivered to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. <br /><br />Voting on the bills to establish the tribunal was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/kenya-delays-vote-on-special-tribunal.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] following allegations that government officials tried to bribe or blackmail MPs to gain support for the measure. More than 1,000 people were killed and 500,000 displaced by violence following <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] in the country&#39;s presidential election. The defeated bills were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/kenya-election-violence-commission.php">proposed by CIPEV</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008 after Odinga and President <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-parliament-approves-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] denied Thursday a petition for an en banc rehearing by convicted former <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron</a> Chief Executive Officer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jeff+skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [JURIST news archives]. Skilling&#39;s petition followed a <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-20885-CR0.wpd.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fifth-circuit-upholds-convictions-of.php">report</a>] last month by a three-judge panel from the Fifth Circuit that upheld his previous convictions and ordered him to be resentenced due to error in the lower court. The court denied the petition for rehearing without comment. Skilling&#39;s laywer Daniel Petrocelli said that he <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/29160966">plans to appeal</a> [CNBC report] to the US Supreme Court.<br /><br />Skilling&#39;s appeal was based on a previous Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C05/05-20319-CR0.wpd.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">report</a>] that overturned convictions for other Enron executives based on &quot;honest services theft&quot; because they had acted in Enron&#39;s best interest by direction and did not profit from their actions. The panel ruled last month that Skilling&#39;s case differed from these previous rulings because &quot;no one at Enron sanctioned Skilling&#8217;s improper conduct&quot; and because Skilling&#39;s compensation structure was aligned with Enron&#39;s earnings. In 2006, Skilling was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-jury-finds-lay-skilling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 19 counts of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud and is currently serving a 24-year sentence. Skilling initially <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/enron-ex-ceo-skilling-appeals.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] his conviction in September 2007 claiming prosecutorial and judicial errors.

The report determined the firing was legal under &sect; 12 of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, 1998, finding:<blockquote>The majority of the Members of the Committee find that the President complied with the provisions of the National Prosecuting Authority Act, 1998. ... The Committee finds that the President applied his mind properly on this matter.

The opposition parties in the Committee, however, are unanimously of the view that Adv Pikoli should be reinstated to his position as National Director of Public Prosecutions.</blockquote> The committee decision was based on the concern that Pikoli&#39;s lack of sensitivity to matters of national security - as evidenced by his handling of the <a href="http://www.pmg.org.za/files/bills/080226browsemolereport.doc">Browse Mole Report</a> [report, DOC], the vetting and search of the Union Buildings, and the arrest and prosecution of the National Commissioner of <a href="http://www.saps.gov.za/default.htm">South African Police Service</a> (SAPS), <a href="http://www.saps.gov.za/_dynamicModules/internetsite/OPbuildBP3.asp?myURL=72">Jackie Selebi</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jackie+Selebi">news archive</a>] - poses a serious threat to South African stability. <br /><br />Pikoli was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/south-africa-president-suspends-top.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] by former South African <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/mbeki.html">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] following his prosecution of Former INTERPOL president and South Africa police commissioner Selebi.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) [official website] announced Friday that <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/103_09.html">no charges will be filed</a> [CPS press release] against <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/">London Metropolitan Police Service</a> (&quot;Met&quot;) [official website] officers involved in the shooting death of Brazilian immigrant <a href="http://www.justice4jean.com/">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> [advocacy website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5173032.stm">profile</a>] in a London Tube station. De Menzes was shot to death by officers in July 2005 after they mistook him for terrorism suspect. The De Menezes killing occurred the day after a failed attempt to replicate the July 7, 2005 <a href="/currentawareness/london.php">London terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], in which four suicide bombers killed 52 people. The CPS review focused on the actions of two Met officers, identified as Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, and was initiated after a jury <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/london-police-found-guilty-in-subway.php">found the Met guilty of violating laws</a> [JURIST report] relating to health and public safety when it shot and killed de Menezes. The CPS inquiry concluded there was insufficient evidence that any offence was committed by individual officers. In the CPS statement, Stephen O&#39;Doherty, the reviewing lawyer from the CPS Special Crime Division, said:<blockquote>The answers the jury provided to specific questions they were asked by the coroner made it clear, albeit to a civil standard, that the jury did not accept the officers&#8217; accounts of what happened. However, although there were some inconsistencies in what the officers said at the inquest, there were also inconsistencies in what passengers had said.  I concluded that in the confusion of what occurred on the day, a jury could not be sure that any officer had deliberately given a false account of events.<br /><br />&quot;I also considered the actions of the individual officers in the police management team on that day and considered whether there was sufficient evidence to charge any of them with gross negligence manslaughter. There was no fresh evidence from the inquest which caused me to change my original decision that there was insufficient evidence to do so.</blockquote>An application has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7888385.stm">already been lodged</a> [BBC report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] concerning prosecutions in cases where a victim is killed at the hands of the state.<br /><br />The de Menezes affair has had significant impact on the Met, and led to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/top-uk-police-chief-resigns-in-wake-of.php">October 2008 resignation of Sir Ian Blair</a> [JURIST report] from his post as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Blair cited a strained relationship with London Mayor Boris Johnson and his decision for new leadership at the Met as the leading factors in his resignation. During the 2007 trial against the Met, the prosecution argued that due to several mistakes made by London police during their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/629/629/7073125.stm">botched anti-terrorism operation</a> [BBC timeline], the public was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7069796.stm">&quot;needlessly put at risk&quot;</a> [BBC report], with Menezes killed as a result. The Met was fined &pound;175,000 with an additional &pound;385,000 in fees. The jury said that operation commander Cressida Dick bore &quot;no personal culpability,&quot; despite the prosecution&#39;s arguments that she was responsible for controlling her officers. Following the guilty verdict, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said that Blair and the police force <a href="http://cms.met.police.uk/news/met_comment/home_office_statement_on_death_of_charles_de_menezes">continued to have her &quot;full confidence&quot;</a> [press release] and thanked them for their work to prevent further terrorist attacks. In August 2007, the UK <a href="http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/index.htm">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/ipcc_stockwell_2.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/uk-counter-terror-official-misled.php">report</a>] clearing Blair of any misconduct.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] granted an <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/13/0416688ebo.pdf"><em>en banc</em> rehearing</a> [order, PDF] to <a href="http://walmartstores.com/">Wal-Mart, Inc.</a> [corporate website] Friday in a long-running gender discrimination suit against the retailer. According to the order, a majority of the Ninth Circuit judges, excluding the three judges who heard an <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/ninth-circuit-upholds-class.php">earlier appeal</a> [JURIST report] in which class certification was upheld, voted in favor of an <em>en banc</em> hearing. The case, <u>Dukes v. Wal-Mart, Inc.</u>, is a class-action lawsuit filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female employees of Wal-Mart</a> [class website] who have alleged that the retailer violated their civil rights by discriminating against them because of their gender. The class has grown to include nearly 2 million women who have worked for Wal-Mart since 1998. In the 2004 class certification ruling, a federal district court judge <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/14/BU4E15U0BA.DTL&hw=wal+mart&sn=001&sc=1000">found evidence</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] that Wal-Mart paid women less than men in every region and in most job categories, and took longer to promote women to management. <br /><br />A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit originally ruled against Wal-Mart&#39;s appeal of the class certification in February 2007, then issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/10/0416688.pdf">new opinion</a> [text, PDF] in conjunction with its decision in December 2007. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/wal-mart-asks-ninth-circuit-to-dismiss.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Ninth Circuit in 2005, arguing that the six lead plaintiffs were not typical or common of the class. Wal-Mart also objected to the size of the class certified, which they say is the largest in US history and would violate its due process rights. Wal-Mart argued that its stores operate independently and should be sued individually; plaintiffs&#39; lawyers countered that individual lawsuits would be impractical. The district court also rejected Wal-Mart&#39;s claim that the class size was &quot;impractical on its face&quot; and approved a statistical formula for paying damages if discrimination is proven.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The first trial in the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] is in danger of being tainted by the body&#39;s <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/02/14/cambodia-first-trial-test-tribunal-s-credibility">failure to meet international fair trial standards</a> [HRW press release], <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Saturday. The ECCC will begin its prosecution of former <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] leaders with <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-court-sets-trial-date.php">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [JURIST report], better known as &quot;Duch,&quot; on Tuesday. HRW claims political interference is apparent in the prosecution&#39;s approach of trying few of the possible former Khmer Rouge leaders, in the name of &quot;national reconciliation.&quot; HRW called on the international community, which is providing financial support for the tribunal, to demand that such concerns over corruption and political influence be addressed. <br /><br />HRW&#39;s plea follows the release of an <a href="http://www.justiceinitiative.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative </a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trials-at-risk-of.php">report</a> [JURIST report], which raised similar concerns last week. UN and Cambodian officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/anti-corruption-measures-needed-to.php">called for anti-corruption measures</a> [JURIST report] in December after allegations were made of kickbacks for judicial appointments. ECCC judges <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-judges-deny.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the corruption allegations in January, stating that they had no reason to pay kickbacks to government officials. A New Zealand judge serving on the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/cambodia-genocide-court-judge-warns.php">insisted</a> [JURIST report] in an August address to colleagues that the genocide trials &quot;are so important for the people of Cambodia [that they] must not be tainted by corruption.&quot; The Khmer Rouge regime is generally held responsible for the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">genocide of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] between 1975 and 1979.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two Pennsylvania judges <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pam/Victim_Witness/Luzerne_county_corruption.html">pleaded guilty</a> [US DOJ materials] Thursday to <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pam/press_releases/Information-Ciavarella_Conahan-1_26_09.pdf">federal corruption charges</a> [criminal information, PDF] <a href="http://www.citizensvoice.com/art/pdf/court_news_release.pdf">filed</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] last month claiming they accepted more than $2.6 million in kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which they had a financial interest. <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] President Judge <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pam/Victim_Witness/Ciavarella_plea%20agreement.pdf">Mark Ciavarella</a> and former President Judge <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pam/Victim_Witness/Conahan_plea%20agreement.pdf">Michael Conahan</a> [plea agreements, PDF] were specifically accused of honest services fraud and tax fraud. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based  <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> [advocacy website] said that juveniles arraigned before Ciavarella between 2003 and 2006 received excessive sentences. Both judges agreed to 87-month prison sentences for themselves, but the pleas will not be formally accepted until sentencing, which could take up to 90 days. The two issues yet to be determined are the amount the judges will be ordered to pay in restitution and whether Ciavarella wrongly incarcerated juveniles to benefit the two companies involved. These <a href="http://www.scrantontimes.com/articles/2009/02/13/news/sc_times_trib.20090213.a.pg1.tt13pleamain_s1.2302288_top2.txt">issues will be resolved</a> [<em>Scranton Times</em> report] during the presentence investigation and through a possible hearing before the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website]. The judges have also agreed to resign their positions and be disbarred. Also Thursday, families whose children were sentenced to the detention centers <a href="http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/articles/2009/02/13/news/doc499591c84f96d726930412.txt">filed a lawsuit</a> [<em>Scranton Times</em> report] against the judges and 14 other defendants, including the company that ran the detention facilities and two individuals who allegedly paid the judges. The judges allegedly received the payments into businesses they owned and in some cases falsely characterized the payments as rental income from a Florida condominium.<br /><br />Judicial corruption cases in the US are relatively rare but not unprecedented. In the 1980s, 17 Illinois judges were indicted after the FBI and the DOJ joined forces in <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/page2/march04/greylord031504.htm">Operation Graylord</a> [FBI backgrounder], aimed at judicial corruption in Cook County, Illinois. Fourteen judges were eventually <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/sc/Centner/Greylord.html">convicted</a> [list]. The first US federal judge convicted of corruption was <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/manton_martin_t/index.html">Martin Manton</a> [NYT backgrounder] of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who sold his vote in various patent cases after suffering financial hardship in the Great Depression. His <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/topics/manton/manton5.pdf">conviction</a>  was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/topics/manton/manton3.pdf">upheld</a> [NYT reports, PDF] by the Second Circuit itself in 1939 and he spent two years in federal penitentiary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The backlog of cases pending in the <a href="http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/index.html">Delhi High Court</a> [official website] would take more than 460 years to clear, according to the court&#39;s <a href="http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/annualreport.htm">annual report</a> [materials]. Chief Justice <a href="http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/ajitprakash.htm">Ajit Prakash Shah</a> [official profile] released the report at a press conference Tuesday. According to the report, the Delhi High Court typically <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/12/stories/2009021253190400.htm">hears a case in less than five minutes</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Hindu</span> report], but the court has close to 10,000 cases still remaining on the docket. This is only the court&#39;s second annual report, although it was founded in 1966.<br /><br />The ratio of judges in India to the population is believed to be around 11 judges per one million citizens. The judiciary in India has long been plagued by what India Supreme Court Chief Justice K. G. Balahrishnan termed an &quot;enormous backlog&quot; of cases in that court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/sci%20Annual%20Report%202007-08.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF]. The report stated that the High Courts throughout the country disposed of 1,505,073 cases in 2007, but gained 805,350 new cases in the first six months of 2008. Many observers blame the problems in the judiciary on widespread corruption of the judicial system. In April 2008, Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-pm-backs-special-courts-for.php">establishment of special courts</a> [JURIST report] to deal specifically with judicial corruption issues.  In October 2008, Indian Supreme Court justice <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/sitting/bnagarwal.htm">Justice B. N. Agrawal</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/india-high-court-judge-withdraws-from.php">withdrew from a corruption hearing</a> [JURIST report] after lawyers publicly condemned the court for protecting other corrupt judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20902.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] four executives from <a href="http://www.rim.com/company/index.shtml">Research In Motion</a> (RIM) [corporate website], the company that makes BlackBerry, with stock options backdating and reached a settlement agreement. The four RIM executives, co-CEOs James Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, CFO Dennis Kavelman, and VP of Finance Angelo Loberto, are accused of backdating approximately 1,400 stock option grants to coincide with historically low closing prices of RIM stock. The four are also accused of re-pricing employee stock options when RIM stock prices dropped following the granting of options to employees. According to both <a href="http://press.rim.com/release.jsp?id=2071">RIM</a> and the <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-27.htm">SEC</a> [press releases], the four RIM executives and the SEC have agreed to a settlement of the option backdating charges, pursuant to which the four executives will neither admit nor deny the SEC&#39;s allegations, and will pay fines of approximately $1.425 million. The SEC complaint comes nearly one week after RIM reached a <a href="http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/Enforcement/Proceedings/SET/set_20090127_rim.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/index_en.jsp?lang=en">Ontario Securities Commission</a> (OSC) [official website] concerning RIM&#39;s stock option backdating practices. As part of the <a href="http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/Enforcement/Proceedings/RAD/rad_20090205_rim.jsp">agreement</a> [order], Balsillie, Lazardis, Kavelman, and Loberto will pay nearly CD $9.05 million in penalties, and be subject to reprimands and other professional restrictions.<br /><br />The practice of backdating involves setting an option-holder&#39;s stock price at a day when stock prices were low instead of the price on the day the option was granted. Although the practice itself is not illegal in the US, it usually involves a violation of SEC and other federal <a href="http://www.soxlaw.com/">reporting requirements</a> [SOX backgrounder]. RIM is the latest technology-related firm to come under SEC scrutiny for stock option backdating. In June 2008, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/broadcom-execs-indicted-for-stock.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] two former executives from the Silicon Vally tech firm Broadcom in connection with a backdating scheme. In January 2008, the former CEO of Brocade Communication Systems was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/brocade-ex-ceo-sentenced-for-stock.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 21 months in prison and fined $15 million for the improper backdating of stock options.  In October 2007, Mercury Interactive <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/mercury-settles-stock-option-backdating.php">settled</a>  [JURIST report] a similar case for a record $117.5 million. In February 2007, the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/doj-indicts-former-mcafee-general.php">indicted</a>  [JURIST report] the former general counsel of McAfee systems for stock option backdating. In January 2007, the US Attorney&#39;s office in San Francisco opened a <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/us-prosecutors-open-criminal-probe-of.php">criminal probe</a> [JURIST report] into backdating at computer maker Apple Inc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Speaker for Italy&#39;s <a href="http://english.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Ministero/IL_MAE/Ministri_Esteri/Gianfranco_Fini.htm">Gianfranco Fini</a>&nbsp;[official profile] said&nbsp;Monday that Italy will not accept detainees&nbsp;released&nbsp;from the US military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Fini made the&nbsp;announcement&nbsp;after a&nbsp;meeting with US House speaker&nbsp;<a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/biography/bio.html">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) [official profile] in Rome, and it contradicts <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-02-13_113342977.html">earlier statements</a> [ANSA report] by Italian defense minister <a href="http://www.difesa.it/Ministro/">Ignazio La Russa</a> [official website, in Italian] in which La Russa said the country may consider accepting the detainees either under asylum status or within its prison system. Fini said that Italian law particularly forbids the country&#39;s prison system from housing foreign inmates absent some formal agreement.<br /><br />Last week, Lithuanian <a href=http://www.urm.lt/index.php?-1266332342>Foreign Affairs Minister Vygaudas Usackas</a> [official profile] said that the <a href="http://www.urm.lt/index.php?-1480537537">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] would begin talks with the US about the possibility of <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/lithuania-weighs-taking-guantanamo.php">accepting prisoners</a> [JURIST post] from Guantanamo Bay. Earlier this month, the <a href=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm>European Parliament</a> [official website] voted 542-55, with 51 abstentions, to <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/shotlist_page/20090204SHL48380/default_sl.htm">adopt a resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/02/europe-parliament-urges-eu-acceptance.php>report</a>] calling for member states to accept low-risk prisoners who cannot be returned to their countries of origin for fear of persecution. Details regarding which prisoners may be transferred to which countries are as yet undetermined. Last month, Council of the European Union Secretary-General <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_applications/applications/solana/index.asp?cmsid=246&lang=EN">Javier Solana</a> [official website] indicated that several EU member states would likely be <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/gena/105561.pdf">willing to accept</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/eu-member-states-to-consider-accepting.php">report</a>] some former prisoners, though acceptance may be conditioned on the US providing careful background checks to prove that the detainees pose no danger to the host country. French Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/ministry_158/ministers_1903/bernard-kouchner_5617/index.html">Bernard Kouchner</a> [official profile] has noted that legal obstacles facing the transfer of the detainees would be different for each host country, and that their acceptance would be determined on a case-by case basis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The administration of US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] on Monday proposed the development of a binding international treaty to regulate global <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/oes/env/87655.htm">mercury</a> [DOS backgrounder] levels. The announcement by US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] Deputy Assistant Secretary for Environment and Sustainable Development Daniel Reifsnyder came at the <a href="http://www.unep.org/gc/gc25/">25th Session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environmental Forum</a> [official website], a meeting of global environment ministers held by the <a href="http://www.unep.org/">United Nations Environment Programme</a> (UNEP) [official website] in Nairobi, Kenya. In his <a href="http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=566&ArticleID=6083&l=en&t=long">statement</a> [text], Reifsnyder said:<blockquote>We have now arrived at a point where there is a call to come together to launch an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international agreement on mercury; ... The United States now joins that call. We are prepared, Mr. Co-Chair to help lead in developing a global legally binding instrument for mercury. ... <br /><br />It is clear that mercury is the most important global chemical issue facing us today that calls for immediate action. Mercury is a chemical of global concern specifically due to its long range environmental transport, its persistence in the environment once introduced, its ability to bio-accumulate in ecosystems, and its significant negative effects or human health and the environment. The United States does not support adding additional substances to an agreement on mercury, or diverting valuable time and attention to other issues by debating criteria and parameters for an adding mechanism.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.zeromercury.org/index.html">Zero Mercury Working Group</a> [advocacy website] commented on the development, noting the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gjEHXtGOtiZbKdW-N6hBmp5vCl9gD96CTD8O0">rapid change</a> [AP report] in approaches from the anti-agreement policies of former president George W. Bush to the approach taken by the Obama administration.<br /><br />Mercury pollution and contamination has been seen as an increasingly important issue in the debates over food and drug safety and environmental protection. Last week, a US federal court <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/federal-court-rejects-cases-linking.php">rejected arguments</a> [JURIST report] in three test cases against the US Department of Health and Human Services by families alleging that their children&#39;s autism was caused by vaccines that contained a mercury-based preservative. In August 2008, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/third-circuit-rules-fda-regulations-do.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that existing US Food and Drug administration regulations did not preempt a New Jersey woman&#39;s state claim that she was poisoned by mercury in canned tuna. Last February, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-epa-power.php">effectively invalidated</a> [JURIST report] a policy promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate electrical power plant mercury emissions. The regulatory scheme would have been implemented in 2010, and would have <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/new-epa-mercury-regs-to-cut-emissions.php">cut mercury emissions by 70 percent of 1999 levels</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A lawyer for one of the men accused in the killing of Russian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya">news archive</a>] alleged in his closing statements Tuesday that the prosecution&#39;s main pieces of evidence are flawed and have been fabricated. Defense lawyer Murad Musayev pointed out that phone records released by the telephone operator Megafon show evidence of manipulation. Musayev&#39;s two-hour closing statements also <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1010/42/374638.htm">alleged</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] that the murder was actually committed by a group of professional killers who left no traces.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=European+Court+of+Human+Rights">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=847116&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&tabl">ruled</a> [decision; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Patrick%20|%20Nolan&sessionid=19290217&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] that the Russian government was guilty of infringing on US missionary Patrick Nolan&#39;s religious freedoms and other human rights by expelling him from the country in 2002 under national security pretenses. The court found that the government violated Article 38 &sect; 1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] for failing to cooperate with the ECHR by not providing the Federal Security Service report explaining their reasons for expulsion, Article 5 &sect; 1 for failing to protect Nolan from deprivation of liberty, Article 8 for failing to consider the welfare of Nolan&#39;s infant son, Article 9 for infringing on his freedom of religion, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 for failing to communicate their reasons for expulsion. The court awarded Nolan 7,000 euros in damages although 20,000 was originally sought.  <br /><br />Nolan, a missionary with Sun Myung Moon&#39;s <a href="http://www.reverendsunmyungmoon.org/">Unification Church</a> [church website], was initially denied re-entry into Russia in 2002 after a trip to Cyprus and was &quot;locked in a small room with no phone, ventilation or windows&quot; at the airport overnight before being deported. Over a month later, Nolan obtained a new visa but was again denied entry into the country, resulting in him being separated from his infant son for ten months. Nolan initially filed complaints against the Moscow Border Control of the Federal Border Service in June 2002. The Russian government addressed Nolan&#39;s complaints without clarity by claiming that his activities were a threat to national security but failed to explain what the activities were. In 2003, the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/mainpage.php">Supreme Court of the Russian Federation</a> [official website, in Russian] denied Nolan&#39;s appeal by holding that Russia retained sovereignty over issues of national security.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tdec/en/090216.pdf">granted in part</a> [decision, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10055">press release</a>] the prosecution&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-mai080922e.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">report</a>] to amend the indictment against former Bosnian Serb leader and war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/karadzic.php">news archive</a>]. Karadzic is now charged with two counts of genocide instead of one, with the first count referring to the crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 and the second count referring to the July 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>]. Charges of complicity in genocide and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions have been dropped. The tribunal denied the prosecution&#39;s motion to add other charges for killings, finding they were not adequately supported by evidence. The prosecution must now file an amended indictment by Wednesday at noon. Karadzic is scheduled to appear before the tribunal Friday to enter a new plea.<br /><br />Last month, Karadzic responded to the prosecution&#39;s motion by filing his own <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/custom1/en/090128.pdf">motion</a> [motion, PDF] requesting that the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/karadzic-requests-shortened-indictment.php">amend his indictment</a> [JURIST report] in order to expedite his trial. Karadzic said that he supports the principle of amending the indictment but that the prosecution&#39;s proposed amendments would not be much better. In arguing for a shorter indictment, Karadzic drew parallels to the trial of former Yugoslav leader <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive], whose lengthy trial was criticized when he <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/milosevic-died-of-natural-causes-icty.php">died of a heart attack</a> [JURIST report] in prison after his trial had been ongoing for four years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA4LTE4OTItY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/08-1892-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl5c31/1/hilite">upheld</a> [text, PDF; NYC <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/law/downloads/pdf/Calorie_Case%20_%20Appeals_Win.pdf">press release</a>] Tuesday a New York City law that requires chain restaurants to post caloric content information on their menus and menu boards in an effort to address obesity rates. The court ruled that <a href="http://www.cookedapple.com/NY_%20calorie_compliance_guide.pdf">New York City Health Code Section 81.50</a> [NYC Health Department guide, PDF] is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/nleatxt.html">Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990</a> [FDA backgrounder]. The court also declined to issue a motion for preliminary injunction in favor of the <a href="http://www.nysra.org/">New York State Restaurant Association</a> (NYSRA) [advocacy website], finding that the code provisions do not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First Amendment</a> [text] rights of restaurant owners who &quot;do not want to communicate to their customers that calorie amounts should be prioritized among other nutritional amounts.&quot; According to the court:<blockquote>Congress intended to exempt restaurant food from the preemption sections that are necessary to allow food to be sold interstate. In requiring chain restaurants to post calorie information on their menus, New York City merely stepped into a sphere that Congress intentionally left open to state and local governments. Furthermore, although the restaurants are protected by the Constitution when they engage in commercial speech, the First Amendment is not violated, where as here, the law in question mandates a simple factual disclosure of caloric information and is reasonably related to New York City&#8217;s goals of combating obesity.</blockquote>President and chief executive of NYSRA Rick Sampson said the association would consider appealing the decision.<br /><br />Enforcement of the law began in July 2008. The provision was a revised version that reflected a September 2007 district court ruling that existing federal law foreclosed the city&#39;s ability to establish its own requirements, but that local governments could mandate that either all restaurants or a defined group of restaurants post calorie information. Litigation over the current form of the health provisions has been going on since early 2008. In April, the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nylawyer.com/adgifs/decisions/041708holwell.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of New York City. The regulations affect roughly ten percent of NYC restaurants. Philadelphia, Seattle, and California have since passed similar regulations.

Michael Leahy Jr., who is <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/three-us-soldiers-charged-with-murder.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the killing of four Iraqi prisoners, as court-martial proceedings began Tuesday. Staff Sgt. Jess Cunningham will be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hYtcV7GUHRC88uGXnQ8Hl6I5lvbAD96DCA2O0">allowed to testify</a> [AP report], despite defense counsel&#39;s objection that its limited time to prepare for this witness puts Leahy at a disadvantage. Cunningham had been charged as a co-conspirator in the murders until last week when his charges were dropped. Leahy&#39;s lawyer argued that the government&#39;s advantage is further strengthened in light of its several months of conversations with Cunningham. Leahy faces life in prison and dishonorable military discharge if convicted.<br /><br />Leahy <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-soldier-facing-court-martial-on.php">faces court-martial</a> [JURIST report] on charges of conspiracy to commit premeditated murder and obstruction of justice, and is among six members of the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th Infantry</a> [unit website] accused in killings that took place between March 10 and April 16, 2007. The prisoners were allegedly shot in the head while bound and blindfolded before being dumped in a canal. Fellow unit members Spc. Belmor Ramon and Spc. Steven Ribordy have already pleaded guilty to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy.php">conspiracy</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-accessory.php">accessory to murder</a> [JURIST reports], respectively, in connection with the incident.

The council was asked by the Paris administrative court to issue an advisory opinion in the case of a Holocaust victim&#39;s daughter who was seeking reparations. In its ruling, the council indicated that the government had already &quot;taken a series of measures, such as pensions, allowances, aids or remedies&quot; to provide compensation and characterized the measures as comparable to those taken by other European states. The council also called for &quot;the solemn recognition of the collective losses suffered by these individuals and the role played by the state in their deportation.&quot; This is the most formal recognition by the French government of its role in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=holocaust">Holocaust</a> [JURIST news archive], although former President Jacques Chirac acknowledged in 1995 that the French government bore some responsibility. <br /><br />In 2006, a French trial court ordered the French government and the state-controlled railway <a href="http://www.sncf.fr/indexe.htm">SNCF</a> [corporate website] to <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/france-court-fines-government-railway.php">pay 60,000 euros, or about $80,000 US, in compensation</a> [JURIST report] to a Jewish family for complicity in crimes against humanity for deporting them during World War II. Monday&#39;s ruling will estop similar claims in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] said Monday that <a href="http://genproc.gov.ru/news/news-9065/?print=1">additional charges will be filed</a> [press release, in Russian] against Russian oil magnate <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khodorkovsky">news archive</a>]. The charges include allegations of embezzlement and theft, contending that Khodorkovsky and a group of investors embezzled more than $100 million from his former company <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yukos">Yukos</a> [JURIST news archive]. Additional charges will also be filed against Khodorkovsky&#39;s former partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website]. Khodorkovsky&#39;s supporters believe that the charges are politically motivated for his opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />Khodorkovsky was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], charges which he still denies. Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">applied for early release</a> last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] by a Russian judge in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges. Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that decision in September.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Tuesday rejected two motions challenging the court&#39;s ability to hear the case filed on behalf of five indicted <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">news archive</a>] guards involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">September 2007 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report]. Lawyers for the defendants asserted that the proceedings should be held in Utah court, contrary to a December order from a federal magistrate judge in Salt Lake City agreeing with the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-judge-orders-blackwater-guards.php">case should remain in the District of Columbia</a> [JURIST report]. The defendants also argued that because charges under Section 3261 of the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> (MEJA) [text] can only be brought against military contractors &quot;to the extent [their] employment relates to supporting the mission of the Department of Defense overseas,&quot; the defendants&#39; duties of providing security for US Department of State officials fell outside the statute. Judge Ricardo Urbina denied the motions to dismiss, declaring that jurisdiction lies in the District of Columbia, and reserving for trial the issue of whether the defendants engaged in military support. The trial is currently set for February 2010. <br /><br />The five guards were <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/grandjury.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-indicts-five-blackwater-guards.php">report</a>] in December on charges of voluntary manslaughter, attempt to commit manslaughter, and using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, which carries a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence. The guards <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/indicted-blackwater-guards-plead-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. A sixth guard <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/us-v-ridgeway.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [text, PDF] to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. In January, the newly implemented <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [CFR materials; McClatchy <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/56116.html">translation</a>] gave Iraq full autonomy to decide which private security forces may operate there, and an Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman announced last month that the country <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/iraq-not-renewing-blackwater-operating.php">would not renew its contract</a> [JURIST report] with <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater Worldwide</a> [corporate website] due to the September 2007 incident. Soon after, the US State Department announced that it <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-not-renewing.php">will not renew its contract with Blackwater Worldwide</a> [JURIST report] to protect American diplomats in Iraq when it expires in May.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Italian court on Tuesday sentenced <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive], a British barrister and former lawyer to <a href="http://www.governo.it/Presidente/index.html">Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official profile, in Italian; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">profile</a>], to four-and-a-half years in prison for accepting a $600,000 bribe to give <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/italian-prosecutors-investigating.php">false testimony</a> [JURIST report] at two trials in 1997 and 1998 involving Berlusconi broadcasting company <a href="http://www.gruppomediaset.it/indexgruppo.jsp?lang=EN">Mediaset</a> [corporate website]. The verdict was announced in an as-yet unpublished opinion from Judge Nicoletta Gandus, who Berlusconi <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-court-denies-berlosconi-bid-to.php">unsuccessfully attempted to remove from the trial</a> [JURIST report] as biased last June. The judgment also ordered Mills to pay 275,000 euros in perversion of justice fines and court costs. Mills was sentenced <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span> and said that he will <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Regioni/Lombardia.php?id=3.0.3027217265">appeal</a> [IGN report, in Italian] the verdict.<br /><br />Mills&#39;s testimonies at issue were given during trials accusing Berlusconi of giving <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">kickbacks to the late Socialist premier Bettino Craxi</a> [JURIST report]. Berlusconi was acquitted of all those charges. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/italy-corruption-trial-of-ex-pm.php">bribery and corruption trial against Berlusconi and Mills</a> [JURIST report] began in 2007, but Berlusconi was removed as a defendant in July after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-upper-house-passes-law-granting.php">new law granted top Italian lawmakers immunity from prosecution</a> [JURIST report] while in office. Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] is now <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/italy-constitutional-court-asked-to.php">considering the legality of the law</a> [JURIST report], and the case against Berlusconi could resume if the high court strikes it down. A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/17/david-mills-silvio-berlusconi-trial">judicial reform bill currently being considered by the Italian parliament</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] could further stall Berlusconi&#39;s trial even if the immunity law is rejected by the high court, as a clause in the bill would require the court to restart the proceeding from the beginning.

According to the MDC, Bennett faces charges under Zimbabwe&#39;s <a href="http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/020122posa.asp?sector=LEGISL&year=0&range_start=1">Public Order and Security Act</a> [materials] for &quot;attempting to commit terrorism, banditry and sabotage.&quot; Bennett, who was scheduled to be sworn in last week as deputy agriculture minister in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7860161.stm">new power-sharing coalition government</a> [BBC report] led by MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai, is accused of funding the purchase of fire arms and explosives intended to be used as part of an insurgency. The MDC has characterized Bennett&#39;s arrest as an <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/pressbody.asp?pressid=65">abduction</a> [press release], and there has been speculation that it could pose a threat to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the MDC and the African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] Monday <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/Decision%2016-02-2009.pdf">dismissed an application</a> [decision, PDF] by two <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees requesting access to Canadian interrogation records. <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/760-mohamedou-ould-slahi/">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</a>, a Mauritanian with landed immigrant status in Canada, and <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/533-hassan-zumiri">Ahcene Zemiri</a> [NYT materials], an Algerian permanent resident of Canada, sought disclosure of records of interrogations conducted by the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) and the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/index-eng.htm">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) [official websites] both in Canada and at Guantanamo Bay. Relying on the decision of the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] in <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc28/2008scc28.pdf">Canada (Justice) v. Khadr</a> [decision, PDF], and claiming protection under <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/#juridiques">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], Slahi and Zemiri argued that Canada was obligated to turn over any materials which had been given to American authorities. The court distinguished this case from <u>Khadr</u> on the grounds that <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khadr">news archive</a>] was a Canadian citizen and necessarily entitled to section 7 protections, where Slahi and Zemiri&#39;s connection to Canada was more tenuous. <blockquote>the Charter, ... is a Canadian instrument enacted to enshrine and protect the fundamental rights of Canadians and those finding themselves within Canada&#8217;s territory. Its extraterritorial reach is exceptional and limited. ... This Court is not prepared to extend the Charter&#8217;s reach beyond that which has already been decided. The Applicants are not Canadian citizens. They have failed to establish the required connection to Canada. Consequently, their circumstances cannot engage a section 7 Charter right.</blockquote>The men requested the disclosure in order to corroborate their allegations of mistreatment at Guantanamo Bay as part of an ongoing <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petition before the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK resident and <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>] was found by British authorities on Sunday to be healthy enough to return to the UK if the US government acquiesces to the request for his release. A group sent to the prison by UK <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website], which included a doctor, worked with Guantanamo medical staff over the weekend and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/15/guantanamo-foreignpolicy">determined</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that the Ethiopian-born detainee did not have any immediate medical problems that would prevent him from traveling back overseas once he is cleared to do so. Mohamed, who <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gv6eZFjXRi0P-UFYhGlIGGOYrMRA">ended his hunger strike</a> [PA report] Wednesday after learning from UK human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/index.html">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] that his release could come within the week, had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jwtfl5fACZH8XzNJOHFmrvKf_9nQD96C7BP00">petitioned</a> [AP report] the British government, through his US military attorney Yvonne Bradley, to pressure the Obama administration for his release. The US government began a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-begins-review-of.php">review</a> [JURIST report] of all Guantanamo cases over the weekend, and Bradley is hopeful that with the review and Mohamed&#39;s medical clearance, he will be approved to return to the UK.<br /><br />Mohamed was arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2004 on suspicion of war crimes in connection with his alleged involvement with al Qaeda attacks on the US. The charges against him were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] last October. Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. In December, he <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">asked the UK government</a> [letter, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">report</a>] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] on Tuesday signed into law the $787 billion <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ARRA_public_review/">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> (ARRA) [materials], intended to stimulate and grow the US economy in the current recession. Along with a number of tax incentives, renewable energy funding provisions, and infrastructure project funding, the law creates a new accountability and transparency regime and website at <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">Recovery.gov</a> [official website] to ensure the proper usage of funds distributed under the ARRA. The new website, one of several innovative communications projects undertaken by the Obama administration, provides users with information from federal agencies receiving funds under the ARRA concerning how, when, and where the funds are spent. In remarks delivered at the signing ceremony, Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-and-Vice-President-at-Signing-of-the-American-Recovery-and-Reinvestment-Act/">said</a> [text]:<blockquote>With a recovery package of this size comes a responsibility to assure every taxpayer that we are being careful with the money they work so hard to earn.  And that&#39;s why I&#39;m assigning a team of managers to ensure that the precious dollars we&#39;ve invested are being spent wisely and well. ... [W]e&#39;re going to hold governors and local officials who receive the money to the same high standard.  And we expect you, the American people, to hold us accountable for the results.  And that&#39;s why we&#39;ve created Recovery.gov -- a web site so that every American can go online and see how this money is being spent and what kind of job is being created, where those jobs are being created.  We want transparency and accountability throughout this process.</blockquote>According to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the Obama administration is considering a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/us/politics/18web-stim.html?hp">second stimulus bill</a> [NYT report] to complement the ARRA.<br /><br />The ARRA had come under Congressional scrutiny in the US Senate earlier this month with the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/senate-amends-buy-american-stimulus.php">amendment</a> [JURIST report] of the &quot;Buy American&quot; clause of the law requiring that all goods used in construction projects, particularly iron and steel, be manufactured in the US in order to receive stimulus funding. The provision was revised to clarify that the law will be applied consistently with US obligations under international trade agreements. Many countries, including Canada, were <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUKN0551421420090205">pleased</a> [Reuters report] with the Senate&#39;s move to amend the provision, but international industry groups like the European steel confederation <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/">Eurofer</a> [official website] believe the move <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/index.php/eng/News-Publications/Press-Releases/EUROFER-warns-US-Senate-s-amendment-on-Buy-American-Bill-does-little-to-remove-the-negative-effects-on-EU-industry">does not go far enough</a> [press release]. The previous version of the bill <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-hints-at-legal-action-if-us-stimulus.php">raised global concerns</a> [JURIST report] about protectionism. Obama has already separated himself from the &quot;Buy American&quot; provision, saying in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/President44/Story?id=6795877&page=3">interview</a> [transcript] earlier this month: &quot;That is a potential source of trade wars that we can&#39;t afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archive] reached an agreement Monday with Islamic militants in the Pakistani North West Frontier Province (NWFP) area of Swat to implement Islamic <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia+law">news archive</a>], according to Pakistani government officials. The implementation of Sharia law in Swat is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/world/asia/17shariah.html?_r=1&ref=world">contingent upon peace</a> [NYT report] between the Pakistani government and Islamic militants linked with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive] operating in the area. The agreement is seen by some as a <a href="http://dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/president-approves-sharia-laws-for-malakand--za">government concession</a> [Dawn report] to Islamic militant groups in the NWFP. As with an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/pakistan-signs-pact-with-islamic.php">tentative agreement</a> [JURIST report] reached in May 2008 to establish Sharia law in the Swat area, Monday&#39;s agreement will create a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7891955.stm">separate justice system</a> [BBC report] for the whole region.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/21/pakistan">May 2008 agreement</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to establish Sharia law in the Swat area, which collapsed amid ongoing violence between Islamic groups and the Pakistani military, provided that militants would halt suicide attacks and hand over foreign fighters under local protection. In exchange, an Islamic justice system would have been created to operate in parallel with the secular system, and established Pakistani courts would have been advised by Islamic scholars. Violence by Islamic militants has long been a problem in Pakistan&#39;s outlying provinces. Earlier in 2008, Pakistan&#39;s top Taliban leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7163626.stm">Baitullah Mehsud</a> [BBC profile] and four others were <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/pakistan-police-file-charges-against.php">charged</a>  [JURIST report] in the assassination of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">former prime minister Benzhair Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Meshud is the commander of Tehrik-e-Taliban, a group of Islamic militants with links to al Qaeda. He has denied involvement in the attack.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian authorities Monday began dismantling illegal immigrant camps around Rome heavily populated by members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> (&quot;gypsies&quot;) [JURIST news archive] following the alleged weekend rape of a 14-year old girl by East European immigrants which led to public outcry and vigilante reprisals. Interior Minister <a href="http://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/ministero/ministro/">Roberto Maroni</a> [official profile, in Italian] meanwhile proposed an emergency decree which would authorize local bodies to create groups of unarmed citizens to &quot;assist the police by bringing to their attention events which might be damaging to urban security.&quot; Italy&#39;s left-wing opposition parties have already voiced disapproval of the move, and the Vatican has warned against scapegoating. <br /><br />In July 2008, the Italian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-begins-mass-fingerprinting-of.php">began recording the fingerprints</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging. Later that month, the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> [official website] called on EU member states to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/european-parliament-calls-for-end-to.php">repeal all anti-Roma laws</a> and the Council of Europe&#39;s Commissioner for Human Rights urged Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/europe-rights-commissioner-urges-change.php">change its &quot;severe&quot; policies</a> [JURIST reports] on Roma people. Italy&#39;s Interior Ministry responded by <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-to-scale-back-roma-fingerprinting.php">announcing</a> [JURIST report] that the government would revise plans to fingerprint the Roma, altering requirements to only include those who do not have valid identification cards.  In November 2005, the <a href="http://www.eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php">European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia</a> (EUMC) [advocacy website] reported that Roma minorities are the ethnic group <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/roma-facing-most-prejudice-in-european.php">most susceptible to racism in the European Union </a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Counterterrorism policies adopted by countries around the world since 2001 pose a &quot;serious threat to the integrity of the international human rights legal framework,&quot; according to a <a href="http://www.icj.org/IMG/EJPReport.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.icj.org/IMG/EJPExecutiveSummary.pdf">executive summary</a>, PDF] issued Monday by a special panel of human rights experts convened by the <a href="http://www.icj.org/sommaire.php3?lang=en">International Commission of Jurists</a> [organization website]. The panel, <a href="http://ejp.icj.org/">Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Human Rights</a> [official website], said that the policies have resulted in torture, abductions, arbitrary and secret detentions, unfair trials, and other limitations on human rights, and that many such policies, originally designed to be temporary, have effectively become permanent. The panel concluded that legal frameworks that existed before 2001 were sufficient to address the risks posed by terrorism, and that any future attempts at combating the threat should be long-term and should not discount fundamental rights:<blockquote>The Panel concludes that terrorism sows terror, and many States have fallen into a trap set by the terrorists. Ignoring lessons from the past, some States have allowed themselves to be rushed into hasty responses, introducing an array of measures which are undermining cherished values as well as the international legal framework carefully developed since the World War II. Seven years after 9/11, and sixty years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is time for the international community to re-group, take remedial action, and reassert core values and principles of international law. Those values and principles were intended to withstand crises, and they provide a robust and effective framework from within which to tackle terrorism. It is clear that the threat from terrorism is likely to be a long-term one, and solid long-term responses are needed.<br /><br />Moreover, the Panel concludes that counter-terrorist policies can only be successful over the longer term with the active support of an informed public. Yet, many of the measures we observed tend instead to encourage an &#8220;us and them&#8221; approach, often alienating communities whose support is essential for successful counter-terrorism action. We need to strengthen, not weaken, civil society if terrorism is to be effectively countered.<br /><br />Last but not least, political leadership is needed urgently at a national and international level to develop a comprehensive strategy committed to combating terrorism, that will <span style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span> &#8211; repudiate torture and all other serious human rights violations, restore respect for well-established principles of international human rights and international humanitarian law, and insist on the effective integration of human rights law into counter-terrorist initiatives.</blockquote> The panel went on to make a series of recommendations on how countries could remedy past damage done by the policies and how better to address terrorist threats in the future. It specifically called for a rejection of the &quot;War on Terror&quot; concept, called for terrorism prosecutions to be brought back within the normal criminal justice system, and called for intelligence gathering efforts to respect privacy rights. It also called for the repudiation of the rights violations, and for those guilty of the violations to be held accountable.<br /><br />Many of the panel&#39;s recommendations were targeted specifically at the new <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archive] administration in the US. In November,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/11/16/us-obama-should-repudiate-bush-counterterrorism-practices">made a similar plea</a>&nbsp;[HRW press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">report</a>] calling on Obama immediately to change what it said were the &quot;abusive&quot; policies of his&nbsp;predecessor, <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive].

The bill apparently targets <a href="http://www.hyporealestate.com/eng/index.php">Hypo Real Estate</a> (HRE) [corporate website], a holding company that, despite receiving over 87 billion euros in bailout money, has not recovered. Merkel <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/nn_4894/Content/DE/Interview/2009/02/2009-02-16-merkel-zdf.html">said</a> [interview transcript, in German] Monday that the country faces a &quot;crisis that is extraordinary&quot; and that implementing the nationalization measure would be a &quot;last resort.&quot; It is likely that a decision to enforce the bill, which would expropriate obstructionist shareholders, would be challenged in Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website].<br /><br />The bill is especially controversial because of Germany&#39;s Nazi and Communist heritage. The British government moved in the direction of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=aW3Q1zaDiel0&refer=uk">nationalizing several UK banks</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] last October.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/civilappeals.htm">England and Wales Court of Appeals (Civil Division)</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2009/92.html">refused</a> [judgment text] to clarify Britain&#39;s law banning assisted suicide in an action initiated by a British woman suffering from multiple sclerosis. Debbie Purdy, who was diagnosed with the disease in 1995 and has since lost most of her ability to function independently, sought the court&#39;s interpretation of the possible legal repercussions that might face her husband on his return to Britain if he accompanied her to a country where assisted suicide is legal. Under the current British <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1132509">Suicide Act of 1961</a> [text], Purdy&#39;s husband could possibly face up to 14 years in prison if he aids, abets, counsels, or procures her suicide. While the court had sympathy for Purdy&#39;s case, it held that a prosecutor does not have a duty to provide specific guidance about how he will exercise his discretion in the future. Though Purdy&#39;s appeal was rejected, the judgment noted other cases in which family members who accompanied loved ones to assisted suicide clinics abroad were spared from prosecution, adding that: <blockquote>Even if a defendant were to be convicted, but the circumstances were such that in the judgment of the court, no penal sanction would be appropriate, the court, exercising its own sentencing responsibilities would order that the offender should be discharged, and might well question publicly the decision to prosecute. In other words, the court is part of the protective system which discourages and would prevent or extinguish the effect of any arbitrary or unprincipled exercise by the [prosecutor] of his responsibilities.</blockquote>The court advised Purdy to seek legal advice on the issue and make her own decision.<br /><br />Physician assisted suicide remains a highly contested issue throughout much of the world. A proposed bill to legalize assisted suicide in the UK was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside by the House of Lords</a> in May 2007 following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition by physician groups</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies narrowly <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/luxembourg-parliament-passes-euthanasia.php">passed a bill legalizing assisted suicide</a> [JURIST report], a move that would have made Luxembourg the third European Union country to allow the controversial practice. The country&#39;s monarch, <a href="http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html">Grand Duke Henri</a> [official website, in French], refused to approve the bill, prompting the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/luxembourg-parliament-limits-monarchs.php">to amend the country&#39;s constitution</a> [JURIST report] to eliminate the requirement that its Grand Duke approve legislation before it becomes law so that the euthanasia bill could move forward. Euthanasia was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1904789.stm">legalized in the Netherlands</a> [BBC report] in 2001, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/belgium-euthanasia-cases-double-since.php">Belgium followed suit</a> [JURIST report] in 2002.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges from more than 30 Spanish provinces went on a one-day strike Wednesday to demand that the country&#39;s judicial system hire more judges and&nbsp;adopt electronic technology to decrease the workload faced by current judges.&nbsp;The judges were led by 21 local judges&#39; assemblies and the <a href="http://www.ajfv.es/quienes-somos.html">Francisco de Vitoria Association</a> (AJFV) and <a href="http://www.forojudicial.com/pagina/">Independent Judicial Forum</a> (FJI) [advocacy websites, in Spanish], and argued that understaffing and the&nbsp;judiciary&#39;s&nbsp;current, primarily paper-based, recording system have <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Bermejo/replica/primer/paro/jueces/ley/antihuelga/elpepunac/20090219elpepinac_4/Tes">created&nbsp;excessive&nbsp;workloads</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</font> report, in Spanish] for the Spain&#39;s estimated 4500 judges. In response to the strike, Spanish Minister of Justice <a href="http://www.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite?cid=1160559581663&pagename=Portal_del_ciudadano/OrgSubSeccionMJ/Tpl_OrgSubSeccionMJ&p=&menu_activo=1152882050659%E2%8C%A9=es_es">Mariano Fernandez Bermejo</a> [official profile, in Spanish] offered to discuss the issue with the groups, but also said that&nbsp;he intends to propose a law to limit the ways in which they may assert their rights given their role in government. The judges have said they plan to challenge any such law.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Spain&#39;s <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/cgpj/principal.htm">General Board of the Judiciary</a> (CGPJ) [official website, in Spanish], issued an <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetDoc?DBName=dPortal&UniqueKeyValue=71043&Download=false&ShowPath=false">official statement</a>&nbsp;[text, PDF, in Spanish] responding to the organizations&#39; <a href="http://www.ajfv.es/20090204-convocatoria-conjunta-ajfv--fji-sobre-huelga-18f.html">plan to strike</a>&nbsp;[press release, in Spanish]. &nbsp;The CGPJ said that it would not recognize the strike because <a href="http://www.datadiar.com/actual/legislacion/laboral/L000071.htm">Articles 3 and 4 of the Royal Decree Law 17/1977</a> [text, in Spanish] do not give the judges a legal right to go on strike. The Spanish judges&#39; initiative, known as the <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/10/19/espana/1224445685.html">October 8 Movement</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">El Mundo</font> report, in Spanish; AJFV <a href="http://www.ajfv.es/actualidad">materials</a>, in Spanish], was sparked by the fine a Huelva judge incurred in <a href="http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/803537/10/08/El-juez-del-caso-Mari-Luz-rechaza-responsabilidades-disciplinarias.html">October 2008</a> [EcoDiario report, in Spanish] for delay in issuing an arrest order for a suspect who later killed a small child.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Under the leadership of successive Labour Party governments the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] has systematically infringed on freedoms and rights of individual British citizens over the past decade, according to a <a href="http://www.modernliberty.net/downloads/abolition_of_freedom.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] released Thursday by the <a href="http://www.modernliberty.net/">Convention of Modern Liberty</a> [advocacy website]. The report, compiled by the <a href="http://www.uclshrp.com/">University College of London Student Human Rights Programme</a> [advocacy website] cites governmental actions that allegedly limit liberties guaranteed by the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], incorporated by statute by the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1">Human Rights Act of 1998</a> [text], as well as uncodified freedoms. Such limitations include increased use of electronic surveillance on individuals, right to detain individuals for up to 28 days without a formal charge, and a lowering of the standard of proof for criminal trials. The report further finds:<blockquote>The attack is as broad as it is deep. Over 25 Acts of Parliament and some 50 individual measures are involved. This document is organised around the articles of the Human Rights Act and also draws on the guarantees of Magna Carta, but it is important to remember that many of the freedoms that are disappearing have never been codified, which makes it all the more difficult to keep track of the attack on liberty</blockquote>Despite the report&#39;s focus on British issues, the Convention also mentioned the growing problem of limitations on civil liberties occurring around the world, particularly in countries that are engaged in counterterrorism efforts.<br /><br />A panel of human rights experts convened by the <a href="http://www.icj.org/sommaire.php3?lang=en">International Commission of Jurists</a> [organization website] said Monday that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/counterterrorism-practices-threaten.php">counterterrorism efforts are a serious threat to global human rights</a> [JURIST report]. The panel found that counterterrorism efforts tended to endorse such actions as torture, abduction and unfair trials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200902/08-5424-1165428.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] an October district court  <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-10-09%20Kiyemba%20corrected%20release%20order%20%282008-10-09%29.pdf">order</a> [opinion and order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">report</a>] that would have provided for the release of 17 Uighur <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report] detainees into the US. Lawyers for the detainees had <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-11-03%20Corrected%20Kiyemba%20brief.pdf">argued</a> [response brief, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/dc-circuit-hears-uighur-release-appeal.php">report</a>]  that the Uighur&#39;s continued detention was improper, but the DC Circuit agreed with the government&#39;s <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-10-24%20Kiyemba%20-%20Gov%27t%20Appeal%20Brief.pdf">position</a> [appeal brief, PDF] that admission of aliens into the US was a decision for either the executive or legislative branch, and that the detainees were not denied a statutory or constitutional right by being excluded. Writing for the majority, Judge Raymond Randolph wrote that the requirements for aliens to be admitted to the US were the exclusive purview of the political branches of government and that it was beyond the court&#39;s authority to grant their admission to the country:<blockquote>For more than a century, the Supreme Court has recognized the power to exclude aliens as &quot;&#39;inherent in sovereignty, necessary for maintaining normal international relations and defending the country against foreign encroachments and dangers &#8211; a power to be exercised exclusively by the political branches of government&#39;&quot; and not &quot;granted away or restrained on behalf of any one.&quot; Ever since the decision in the Chinese Exclusion Case, the Court has, without exception, sustained the exclusive power of the political branches to decide which aliens may, and which aliens may not, enter the United States, and on what terms. [citations&nbsp;omitted]</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a> [advocacy website], which had filed an <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/Kiyemba%20v%20Bush%20amicus%20brief.pdf"><font style="font-style:italic;">amicus curiae</font> brief</a> [text, PDF] on the Uighurs&#39; behalf, <a href="http://campaign.constantcontact.com/render?v=001wyGceUOSNjBGnJt6PiiJbfk-LF9wJ4WaHhPA59RpT7jCWwVDWxzJdoIuslXSpQ6MimSL0Qvo-zS_jQJUgL_g-rIzzcUbxrzau7G4KluL5faA3s7JD8y5S_JUmF_4IRqjGoxBtm8nBY_GFSnNH93AbA%3D%3D">criticized the ruling</a> [press release] shortly after its release, and called on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] to use his executive authority to order their release and admission to the US.<br /><br />The US government has determined that the Uighurs are not <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000948---a000-.html">unlawful enemy combatants</a> [10 USC &sect; 948a text; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">news archive</a>], but it has linked them with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9179/east_turkestan_islamic_movement_etim.html">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [CFR backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. China has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">renewed its demand</a> [JURIST report] for the Uighurs to be repatriated, and in October, Chinese authorities <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/21/china-terrorism">called on other nations</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Guardian</font> report] to arrest and extradite eight alleged ETIM members whom they suspected of plotting to attack the Olympic Games this past summer in Beijing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.med.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Maine</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.med.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Singal/2009/GZS_02182009_2-08cr187_United_States_v_James_Tobin.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] charges of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1001.html">making false statements</a> [18 USC &sect; 1001 text] against former Republican National Committee regional director <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=James_Tobin">James Tobin</a> [SourceWatch profile]. Tobin had earlier been <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/bush-campaigner-sentenced-in-new.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in connection with a scheme to <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/former-bush-campaign-chairman-indicted.php">jam phone lines to block Democratic voting drives</a> [JURIST report] during the 2002 Senate election in New Hampshire, but was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/bush-campaigner-acquitted-in-new.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of the charges on appeal in February 2008. After his acquittal, prosecutors charged Tobin with making false statements in relation to the original investigation, but Tobin challenged the new charges, arguing that they were brought simply because of his successful appeal. Agreeing with Tobin, Judge George Singal dismissed the charges, holding that they constituted vindictive prosecution. Singal wrote that given the circumstances and timing of the new charges, there was a presumption that prosecution was improper and that the government had not successfully rebutted that presumption:<blockquote>&quot;A defendant may establish a vindictive prosecution either (1) by producing evidence of actual vindictiveness or (2) by demonstrating circumstances that reveal a sufficient likelihood of vindictiveness to warrant a presumption of vindictiveness.&quot; Although Tobin asserts both actual and presumptive vindictiveness, he emphasizes the latter. Once raised, the government must rebut a presumption of vindictiveness &quot;by showing objective reasons for its charges,&quot; such as the discovery of new evidence...<br /><br />In short, these circumstances present a quintessential appearance of vindictiveness. Indeed, the sequence of events alone might well justify a presumption of vindictiveness; courts view quite skeptically the government&#8217;s decision to file more severe charges following a defendant&#8217;s successful appeal of his conviction. [citations omitted]</blockquote>Former president of Republican consulting group GOP Marketplace Allen Raymond <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/republican-consultant-sentenced-in-nh.php">received a five month sentence</a>, and former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party Chuck McGee was <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/former-head-of-new-hampshire-gop_10.php">sentenced to seven months in prison and $2,000 in fines</a> [JURIST reports] in 2005 in connection with the scheme. McGee admitted that he paid a Virginia telemarketing company more than $15,000 to jam Democratic Party phone lines with computer-generated calls. In 2006, former owner of the telemarketing firm Mylo Enterprises Inc. Shaun Hansen <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/telemarketer-pleads-guilty-in-2002-gop.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to two federal counts of conspiracy to commit interstate telephone harassment. A <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/democrats-going-to-court-for-gop.php">civil lawsuit</a> brought by the New Hampshire Democratic Party against the New Hampshire Republican State Committee was <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-hampshire-gop-phone-jamming-case.php">settled</a> [JURIST reports] in 2006 for $135,000.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">French National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] approved a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/ta/ta0242.asp">bill</a> [text, in French] Tuesday to provide government subsidies to individuals who temporarily leave work to care for dying relatives. The proposed law states that family members will be paid a &quot;daily allowance to accompany a dying person&quot; for a maximum of three weeks. Supporters of the bill said in a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/cri/2008-2009/20090168.asp">session meeting of the National Assembly</a> [transcript, in French] that a primary objective in passing the bill was to make it possible for an individual to die at home with family and further encourage family solidarity at the end of life. The National Assembly, the lower house of the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=French+Parliament">French Parliament</a> [JURIST archive] <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_FRANCE_HELPING_THE_DYING?SITE=TXDAM&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">passed</a> [AP report] the bill with unanimous support.  Before it can become law in France, the <a href="http://www.senat.fr/">Senate</a> [official website, in French] must vote to approve the bill, which observers say is likely. <br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s bill will extend the benefits of an existing law that allows for individuals to take as many as sixth months of unpaid leave to care for a dying family member. In the US, the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/">Family Medical Leave Act</a> [DOL backgrounder] requires an employer to grant an eligible employee up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for an immediate family member who is seriously ill. There is no US legislation to provide subsidies for workers on leave.

Radic was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mrksic/tjug/en/070927.pdf">acquitted</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/icty-convicts-leader-in-vukovar.php">report</a>] of war crimes charges by the ICTY in 2007 and is seeking more than $600,000 in compensation for his imprisonment. Lawyers for Serbia <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=02&dd=18&nav_id=57258">argued</a> [B92 report] that, because the ICTY is not a Serbian court, the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/8918">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> [text, PDF] does not provide for his compensation. Lawyers for Radic argued that he should still&nbsp;receive&nbsp;the money because of the role Serbia played in his prosecution before the ICTY. The ICTY does not compensate acquitted suspects for time they have served in prison during trial.<br /><br />Radic was originally accused of &quot;planning, instigating, ordering or otherwise aiding and abetting&quot; war crimes in the 1991 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2988304.stm">Vukovar massacre</a>&nbsp;[BBC backgrounder] in which Serb-led forces executed approximately 260 detainees. Radic was the only acquitted member of the so-called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1937767.stm">&quot;Vukovar Three&quot;</a> [BBC backgrounder; ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/mrksic/4">materials</a>], which included Mile Mrksic and Veselin Sljivancanin. Last year, Norway <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/norway-to-extradite-vukovar-war-crimes.php">agreed to extradite</a> [JURIST report] an unnamed Croatian citizen for his alleged involvement in the massacre.

The court unanimously found that the UK detained Qatada and 10 others following the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] in violation of the prisoners&#39; Article 5 right to liberty and security, right to a judicial review of the detention, and right to compensation. The judgment found no violation of Article 3, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. The UK was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/19/abu-qatada-compensation-european-court">ordered</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to pay a total of &pound;26,000 to the detainees, plus &pound;53,000 in legal costs. Qatada, once considered one of Osama bin Laden&#39;s chief associates in Europe, had been seeking &pound;170,000, but the court explained that the damages awarded were significantly lowered because the government&#39;s decision to detain Qatada and the others was &quot;devised in the face of a public emergency.&quot; The UK government <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJrhmRXljX5D9Wrjsw-rB7QAfdyQ">reacted with disappointment</a> [AFP report] to the decision, but applauded the court&#39;s consideration of the situation surrounding the detentions in lowering the damages awards.<br /><br />The ECHR decision came one day after the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about_lords/the_law_lords.cfm">Law Lords</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldjudgmt/jd090218/rbalge-1.htm">ruled</a> [judgment; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">report</a>] that Qatada can be deported to Jordan to face terror charges, despite fears that he will be tortured upon his return.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sweden&#39;s <a href="http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2625.aspx">Migration Court</a> [official website, in Swedish] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/lansrattenistockholm/Pressmeddelande/UM%206523-08.pdf">granted</a> [judgment, PDF, in Swedish; <a href="http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_Press____9665.aspx">press release</a>, in Swedish] asylum to former Uighur <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7816611.stm">Adil Hakimjan</a> [BBC backgrounder], also known as Adel Abdu Al-Hakim. The decision overruled a previous ruling by the Swedish Migration Board denying Hakimjan asylum. Hakimjan, who was held at Guantanamo Bay for nearly five years, was one of five Uighurs <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 who were granted asylum in Albania. Hakimjan had applied for asylum in Sweden because he has a sister living there. The court cited the family relationship, the humanitarian nature of the request, and Hakimjan&#39;s detention at Guantanamo Bay as reasons for granting him residence as a refugee.<br /><br />Also on Wednesday a panel of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200902/08-5424-1165428.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/dc-circuit-rules-against-release-of.php">report</a>] an October district court  <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-10-09%20Kiyemba%20corrected%20release%20order%20%282008-10-09%29.pdf">order</a> [opinion and order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">report</a>] that would have provided for the release of 17 Uighur Guantanamo Bay detainees into the US. The US government has determined that the Uighurs are not <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000948---a000-.html">unlawful enemy combatants</a> [10 USC &sect; 948a text; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">news archive</a>], but it has linked them with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9179/east_turkestan_islamic_movement_etim.html">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [CFR backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. Earlier this month, China <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">renewed its demand</a> [JURIST report] for the Uighurs to be repatriated. Despite the demands, the US government has been hesitant to release the Uighurs back to China, fearing they will be tortured upon their return.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Both the <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan government</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">news archive</a>] and the separatist <a href="http://www.ltteps.org/">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [group website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">news archive</a>] have committed human rights violations by attacking civilians in the Vanni region, according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/srilanka0209web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The report <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/02/19/sri-lanka-end-war-civilians">alleges</a> [HRW press release] that both sides &quot;appear to be engaged in a perverse competition to demonstrate the greatest disregard for the civilian population.&#8221; HRW asserts that both sides have violated the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/1d1726425f6955aec125641e0038bfd6">Hague Regulations of 1907</a> [text], as well as <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/93.htm">Protocol I</a> [text] and <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/d67c3971bcff1c10c125641e0052b545">Protocol II</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [materials]. Violations by the LTTE relate to the confinement of civilians to the conflict zone and putting civilians at unnecessary risk, by both confining them to an increasingly compact area and by employing civilians as forced labor on the battlefield. The alleged violations by the Sri Lankan armed forces include indiscriminate attacks, attacks on the &quot;Safe Zone,&quot; and attacks on hospitals.  <br /><br />Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=navi+pillay">news archive</a>] issued a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/7C48F59856B2A8BCC125754D003C5D24?opendocument">statement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] condemning the deteriorating conditions of those trapped in the conflict-ravaged north, calling for investigations and prosecutions for the killings and other human rights abuses. HRW has repeatedly accused both sides of violations, but since 2007 has focused on the government&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sri-lanka-should-halt-internment-of.php">de facto internment centers</a> and its role in the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/sri-lanka-government-rights-abuses-on.php">unlawful killings and other human rights violations</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egyptian authorities in Cairo released imprisoned political opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4558054.stm">Ayman Nour</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://www.freeaymannour.org/">advocacy website</a>] late Wednesday for medical reasons. Egypt&#39;s public prosecutor <a href="http://press.jrc.it/NewsExplorer/entities/en/786861.html">Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud</a> [EMM profile] unexpectedly announced the release of nine prisoners for medical reasons, including Nour. Only two days prior, Nour&#39;s wife expressed her belief that her husband would be kept in jail beyond July 2009, his earliest parole date, and reaffirmed that the detention endangered Nour&#39;s health. Nour said that the release was indeed unexpected and did not result from a negotiation, and that he is eager to resume his political activism. He is restricted from running in the next presidential elections in 2011 by his previous conviction, and his party has experienced much internal turmoil since he was imprisoned. In November, <a href="http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=17634">internal clashes led to a fire</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Egypt Daily News</span> report] in the party&#39;s own headquarters.<br /><br />A lawyer and former member of the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/English/default.htm">Egyptian Parliament</a> [official website], Nour was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/egyptian-opposition-leader-sentenced.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] and jailed in 2005 for allegedly forging signatures on petitions to form the <a href="http://news.elghad.org/news/">Al-Ghad Party</a> [party website, in Arabic], a liberal democratic political party, following a trial that was denounced by human rights organizations as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/12/06/egypt-ayman-nur-trial-badly-flawed">unfair and flawed</a> [HRW report]. In the 2005 presidential election, the first multi-candidate contention in Egypt since President Hosni Mubarak has been in office, Nour garnered 8 percent of the vote against Mubarak&#39;s 89 percent. Nour&#39;s jailing was also a source of tension in US relations as the Bush administration petitioned repeatedly for his release. In March 2008, Egypt&#39;s Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/egypt-appeals-court-rejects-release-of.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] a medical release to Nour, who is a diabetic. In <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/egypt-court-rejects-plea-for-opposition.php">May</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/egypt-court-refuses-to-consider-release.php">August</a> [JURIST reports] 2007, Egyptian courts rejected two other petitions to release Nour early for medical reasons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Abdul-Amir al-Rubaie of the <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040422_CPAORD_13_Revised_Amended.pdf">Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a> (CCCI) [establishment order, PDF] on Thursday postponed the trial of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7787792.stm">Muntadar al-Zaidi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Zaidi">news archive</a>], the Iraqi journalist accused of throwing his shoes at former US president <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive]. The new trial date is set for March 12.  Al-Zaidi&#39;s lawyers <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090219/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq;_ylt=A0LEUG6Tjp1JMAsB4hjZn414">argued</a> [AP report] that Bush&#39;s visit was not official and therefore the charge of assaulting a foreign leader should not apply. The trial was postponed so the court could determine if Bush&#39;s visit was official and respond to the defense. Al-Zaidi&#39;s appearance in court on Thursday was his first public appearance since his December arrest. He testified to a three-judge panel that his actions were meant to restore Iraqi citizens&#39; pride and that he had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">beaten while in custody</a> [JURIST report]. The assault charge holds a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison while a lesser charge of insulting a foreign leader is punishable by up to three years. Al-Zaidi&#39;s lawyers have been unsuccessful in having the charge reduced or dismissed.  <br /><br />Al-Zaidi&#39;s trial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-court-delays-trial-of-shoe.php">initially delayed</a> [JURIST report] in December so the court could make a determination of the charges. The trial has been opposed for failing to meet international standards of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/14/quality-justice">due process and fairness</a> [HRW report] and has been protested by Iraqis. The shoe-throwing incident occurred at a December 14 <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html">joint news conference</a> [transcript] at which Bush and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] signed a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] governing the future US military presence in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href=http://www.sec.gov/>Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20901.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; SEC <a href=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-26.htm>press release</a>] financier <a href=http://www.stanfordfinancial.com/sir_allen>Allen Stanford</a> [professional profile] Tuesday with orchestrating a fraudulent $8 billion investment scheme by selling certificates of deposits on the promise of improbably high interest rates. Stanford, through his investment companies - <a href=http://www.stanfordinternationalbank.com/contactus.cfm>Stanford International Bank</a> (SIB), <a href=http://www.stanfordgroup.com/>Stanford Group Company</a> (SGC) and <a href=http://www.stanfordcapitalmgmt.com/>Stanford Capital Management</a> (SCM) [corporate websites] - is accused of violating the <a href=http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/33Act.htm>Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href=http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/34Act.htm>Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> and the <a href=http://www.thecre.com/fedlaw/legal5b/uscode15-80a-1.htm>Investment Company Act of 1940</a> [materials]. US District Judge Reed O&#39;Connor issued a temporary restraining order to freeze Stanford&#39;s assets, as customers have rushed to withdraw their investments from SIB branches in Antigua and Venezuela.<br /><br />Stanford faces many of the same charges as <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=madoff>Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive], who is <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">accused of coordinating a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">consented to a partial judgment</a> [JURIST report] with the SEC over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against him. According to the SEC, the agreement will continue the previously imposed preliminary injunction, but in consenting to the agreement, Madoff will neither admit nor deny the SEC&#39;s allegations. The Stanford and Madoff charges, in concert with global economic woes, may invigorate the debate on financial regulation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Moscow Military District Court on Friday acquitted&nbsp;three men suspected of being involved in the murder of Russian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya">news archive</a>].&nbsp;The three men, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov and Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, were&nbsp;<a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090220/120238718.html">released</a>&nbsp;[RIA Novosti report]&nbsp;after a jury on Thursday found the evidence against them&nbsp;<a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090219/120225894.html">insufficient for a conviction</a>&nbsp;[RIA Novosti report].  Colonel Pavel Ryaguzov has&nbsp;also been acquitted for charges related to the case. The judge in the case, Yevgeniy Zubov, has&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7901136.stm">ordered a new investigation</a> [BBC report] into Politkovskaya&#39;s murder, and prosecutors have 10 days to appeal the verdict.&nbsp;<br /><br />A lawyer for one of the accused alleged Tuesday that prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/politkovskaya-murder-suspect-alleges.php">fabricated evidence</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] and pointed to other irregularities in the evidence including a lost DVD with security camera footage and claims of other prosecutorial misconduct.  Since the trial began in October, judge Yevgeniy Zubov has closed and then opened the proceedings to the public <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zubov">three times</a> [JURIST news archive], citing juror security concerns and the presentation of classified information.  After Thursday&#39;s jury finding, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged Russian authorities to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/russian-federation-anna-politkovskaya-s-trial-closes-investigation-must-">continue the investigation</a> [press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dadiran.ir/">Judiciary of Iran</a> [official website, in Persian] announced Tuesday that it has submitted proposed legislation to the <a href="http://majles.ir/mhtml/index.php?newlang=english">Iranian Parliament</a> [official website] recommending substantial changes to the treatment of juvenile offenders in <a href="/countries/iran.php">Iran</a> [JURIST news archive]. The legislation seeks to <a href="http://www.iranvnc.com/floater_article1.aspx?lang=en&t=floater_censoredculture&id=7931">amend</a> [IranVNC report] the classification of minors into three age groups - 7-12, 12-15, and 15-18 - to allow for more appropriate sentencing of offenders. The judiciary further recommends that the <a href="/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] be used only if it can be demonstrated that the offenders possessed the maturity to understand the implication of their crimes. The new age classifications also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itW6Ls9cR27XOgngIny3mpug8K_g">seek to limit</a> [AFP report] time spent in jail. A juvenile under 15 who commits a crime may receive little or no time in a juvenile prison for a crime that, when committed by an adult, would result in substantial jail time.<br /><br />The proposed legislation signals further change from previous attitudes concerning the punishment of minor offenders. In October, the Judiciary <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/iran-bans-execution-of-minors-for-drug.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] the imposition of the death penalty for drug-related offenses. Iran has previously been heavily criticized by human rights groups for imposing the death penalty on minors. In September, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Iran to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27894&Cr=iran&Cr1=">ban the use of the death penalty</a> [UN News Centre report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/un-rights-commission-urges-iran-to-stop.php">report</a>] against juvenile offenders. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] has said that Iran <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">leads the world in executing the most people for crimes committed as children</a> [press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2009/ag-speech-090218.html">said</a> [statement text] Wednesday that, despite landmark court decisions and legislation bolstering the official recognition of racial equality, the US remains a country that has not truly resolved its racial divide. Holder, who is the country&#39;s first African American attorney general, made his remarks during a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] event commemorating Black History Month and said it should be used to facilitate a dialogue about race. Holder said that average Americans &quot;simply do not talk enough with each other about race,&quot; and that he would use his position as attorney general to help address the problem:<blockquote>Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. Though race related issues continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion, and though there remain many unresolved racial issues in this nation, we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about race. It is an issue we have never been at ease with and given our nation&#8217;s history this is in some ways understandable. And yet, if we are to make progress in this area we must feel comfortable enough with one another, and tolerant enough of each other, to have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us. But we must do more- and we in this room bear a special responsibility. Through its work and through its example this Department of Justice, as long as I am here, must - and will - lead the nation to the &quot;new birth of freedom&quot; so long ago promised by our greatest President. This is our duty and our solemn obligation.</blockquote>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] voted 75-21 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-senate-confirms-holder-as-attorney.php">confirm</a> [JURIST report] Holder as attorney general. Prior to becoming the attorney general, Holder served as a associate judge for the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/superior/index.jsp">Superior Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/index-dag.html">Deputy US Attorney General</a> [archive materials] during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Holder served briefly as acting attorney general during a brief period of the Bush administration before the confirmation of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1120440.stm">John Ashcroft</a> [BBC profile].

The approval brings the treaty closer to full ratification by the EU&#39;s 27 member states, though it still must pass the nation&#39;s <a href="http://www.senat.cz/index-eng.php">Senate</a> [official website], be signed by <a href="http://www.klaus.cz/klaus2/asp/default.asp?lang=EN&CatID=YJrRHRsP">President Vaclav Klaus</a> [official website] and face a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-agrees-to-hold-second.php">referendum in Ireland</a> [JURIST report]. The measure is expected to draw rigorous debate in the Senate, where some leaders want to <a href="http://www.ods.cz/eng/policy/new.php?ID=518">delay ratification</a> [ODS press release] until the parliament approves a plan to host a radar base for a US missile defense system. If the agreement does pass the Senate, Klaus has expressed a desire to put off signing it until the issue is resolved in Ireland. <br /><br />The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU&#39;s six-month, rotating presidency, has faced pressure from EU states to approve the agreement after delays, including a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/czech-court-finds-eu-reform-treaty.php">failed constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Irish voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the treaty in a June 2008 referendum, prompting <a href="http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=437">Polish President Lech Kaczynski</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/poland-president-refuses-to-sign-eu.php">refuse</a> [JURIST report] to sign, calling it &quot;pointless.&quot; In November 2008, Sweden <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/sweden-parliament-approves-treaty-of.php">became the 24th EU state to ratify the charter</a> [JURIST report]. In 2005, a proposed <a href="/currentawareness/euconstitution.php">European constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] failed when voters in <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-exit-polls-say-france.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST reports] rejected the proposal in national referenda.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] said Friday that the US <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressS&id=13834737">has agreed to return</a>&nbsp;[press release] UK resident and <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>] to the country as soon as his transfer can be arranged. Mohamed was found by British authorities on Sunday to be <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-guantanamo-detainee-medically.php">healthy enough to return</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] to the UK after stopping his hunger strike, and the FCO said that his return comes after a long-standing request by the UK that its residents held at Guantanamo be returned to the country. It also said that his return did not indicate that he would be permitted to stay permanently in the country, but that it was an intermediate step to help the US close the military prison. The FCO said that his immigration status would be reviewed following his return to the UK.<br /><br />Mohamed was arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2004 on suspicion of war crimes in connection with his alleged involvement with al Qaeda attacks on the US. The charges against him were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] last October. Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. In December, he <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">asked the UK government</a> [letter, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">report</a>] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi government has reopened the prison formerly called <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/iraq/abughraib_halton.html">Abu Ghraib</a> [CBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=abu+ghraib">news archive</a>], promising to operate the prison by international standards and allow inspections by humanitarian groups. In a tour for members of the media Saturday, officials said they hoped to temper the strong feelings many Iraqis hold toward the prison with a new name, Baghdad Central Prison, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/world/middleeast/22iraq.html?ref=middleeast">renovations</a> [NYT report] including fresh paint, exercise equipment, and a library. The facility currently holds 300 prisoners, but officials expect to reach a capacity more than 12,000 once improvements are complete. <br /><br />The prison was the site of torture and executions under <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive] and gained further notoriety due to detainee abuse by American soldiers. Officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/iraq-officials-announce-reopening-of.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the prison&#39;s reopening in January. In December, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-detainee-abuses-approved-by-senior.php">senior US officials were responsible</a> [JURIST report] for the use of abusive interrogation techniques against detainees held in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. The bipartisan report stated that the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib &quot;was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own&quot; but grew out of interrogation policies approved by former Defense Secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] and other top officials. The prison was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">returned to the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/default.aspx">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-31191-CV0.wpd.pdf">reversed a lower court ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] that dismissed a suit resulting from <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive] brought on behalf of the US against eight flood insurers. The original suit, brought by Realtor Branch Consultants under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sec_31_00003730----000-.html"><span style="font-style:italic;">qui tam</span> provisions of the False Claims Act</a> [31 USC &sect; 3730 text], alleged that insurance companies who participated in the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/business/nfip/wyo.shtm">Write Your Own</a> (WYO) [materials] flood insurance program of the <a href="http://www.fema.gov">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) [official website] improperly passed the cost of flood damage to areas affected by Hurricane Katrina onto the government. The <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] dismissed the suit because two defendants, <a href="http://www.allstate.com">Allstate Insurance Company</a> and <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/insurance/insurance.asp">State Farm Fire and Casualty</a> [corporate websites], were also named in a pending Mississippi District Court case, <u>States ex rel. Rigsby v. State Farm Insurance Co.</u> (<u>Rigsby</u>), alleging the same offense. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Allstate and State Farm, and reversed the dismissal of those companies not named in the Mississippi suit. Explaining their decision not to extend the first-to-file bar to the remaining six defendants, Judge Catharina Haynes said:<blockquote><u>Rigsby</u> does not allege a true industry-wide fraud or concerted action among a narrow group of participants. Rather, looking only at the facts pleaded ... <u>Rigsby</u> implicates, at most, four specific WYO insurers among the approximately ninety-five WYO insurers conducting business in the Louisiana and Mississippi areas during Hurricane Katrina. Thus, <u>Rigsby</u> tells the government nothing about which of the ninety-one other WYO insurers ... if any, actually engaged in any fraud.</blockquote>The court declined to rule on the insurers&#39; alternative argument, that the suit should be dismissed because a <span style="font-style:italic;">qui tam</span> suit is improper if the information is publicly known, ruling that the first determination should be made by the district court.<br /><br />Damage from Katrina has resulted in several insurance-related suits. A <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-judge-dismisses-hurricane.php">prior fraud claim against State Farm</a> [JURIST report] was dismissed in April 2008 by a federal court in Mississippi as without an actionable basis. Earlier that month, the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-vacates-punitive.php">vacated $2.5 million in punitive damages</a> [JURIST report] awarded to a Mississippi couple in an action against State Farm. Allstate and State Farm were also among the insurance companies sued for <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/louisiana-ag-sues-insurance-industry.php">conspiring to fix payouts</a> [JURIST report] by Louisiana&#39;s Attorney General in November 2007. The US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi has a collection of <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/insurance.htm">Hurricane Katrina insurance orders and opinions</a> [materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Released <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>] was returned to the UK on Monday after being held for nearly seven years. Mohamed had immigrated from Ethiopia to the UK prior to his arrest, and it is not yet known whether he will be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7905657.stm">permitted to remain</a> [BBC report] in the country, whose government he has repeatedly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/feb/23/binyam-mohamed-return-uk">accused</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of being involved in his alleged torture.  Mohamed recently ended a hunger strike, and British authorities declared him <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-guantanamo-detainee-medically.php">healthy enough to travel</a> [JURIST report] last week. The UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] said that his return comes in response to a longstanding request for the return of UK residents held at Guantanamo.<br /><br />Mohamed was arrested and sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2004 on suspicion of war crimes in connection with his alleged involvement with al Qaeda attacks on the US. The charges against him were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] last October. Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials, he was then transferred to Moroccan agents who tortured him. In December, he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">asked the UK government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] chairman <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-11.htm">Mary Schapiro</a> [official profile] on Thursday named <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-31.htm">Robert Khuzami</a> [SEC press release] as the new director of the SEC&#39;s Division of Enforcement. Khuzmani replaces former director of enforcement Linda Thomsen, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">stepped down from the position</a> [JURIST report] last week. Khuzami has previously served as a federal prosecutor in the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/index.html">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], and as General Counsel for the Americas for the international investment bank <a href="http://www.db.com/en/content/company/our_company.htm?ghpnavigation=ENG_Our_Company">Deutsche Bank AG</a> [corporate website]. In a statement, Schapiro said:<blockquote>I&#39;m pleased to have Rob join the SEC in such an important role at this crucial time. ... As we work to improve investor confidence in the markets, our enforcement efforts are vital. Throughout his career, Rob has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to prosecuting wrongdoers and protecting citizens. As a former federal prosecutor, Rob is well-suited to lead the SEC&#39;s Division of Enforcement as we continue to crack down on those who would betray the trust of investors.</blockquote>As a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Khuzami prosecuted a number of financial crimes, and also assisted in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/19/AR2009021903113.html">the conviction of Omar Abdel-Rahman</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.<br /><br />Khuzami&#39;s appointment as head of the SEC&#39;s enforcement division comes as the agency has been rocked by heavy criticism for apparently lax enforcement in the wake of the alleged Ponzi scheme perpetrated by disgraced Wall Street investor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a>  [JURIST news archive], who faces <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">criminal charges</a> [JURIST brought] brought by the SEC. Similar charges were filed by the SEC against <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">Allen Stanford</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week. In the week following Madoff&#39;s charges, then-SEC chairman Christopher Cox said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-launching-investigation-of-failure.php">report</a>] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long. In December, then-President-elect <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president-elect_obama_names_key_regulatory_appointments/">named</a> [press release] Schapiro as the SEC Chairman, replacing Cox. Madoff was charged with securities fraud in December for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts]. UK financial firm <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/">Bramdean Alternatives Limited</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/news/send_attachment/48">raised concerns</a> [statement, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/uk-financial-institution-assails-us.php">report</a>] about the US financial regulatory process after its value dropped by more than 35 percent following news of its exposure to the fraud.

		<title>European leaders call for increased financial regulation in lead-up to G20 summit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] European members of the <a href="http://www.g20.org/">Group of 20</a> (G20) [official website] financial policy body said Sunday that <a href="http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/g20-in-berlin-10464/">tighter regulation</a> [EU press release] of the financial industry and liberal trade policies are necessary to help the global&nbsp;economy&nbsp;recover from its recent downturn. The leaders met in Brussels to discuss the &quot;European position&quot; on how to address the crisis, in anticipation of the full G20 meeting on April 4. In a <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/nn_127772/Content/EN/Artikel/2009/02/2009-02-22-g20-eu-vorbereitungsgipfel__en.html">release</a> [text] on the talks, German Chancellor <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/EN/Homepage/home.html">Angela Merkel</a>&nbsp;[official website] announced that the group specifically wants to double the budget of the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website], increase regulation of hedge fund operators, impose sanctions against countries which host tax shelters, and discourage protectionist trade policies. The G20&#39;s <a href="http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2008-leaders-declaration-081115.html">last meeting</a>&nbsp;[summit release] was in November, during which members called for global solutions to the crises to be presented at the April meeting.<br /><br />It remains unclear how other world economic powers, like the US, will respond to the European initiatives, given the country&#39;s prior resistance to increased regulation of the international financial industry. Last week, the US took a major step in its effort to stimulate its economy through the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-signs-recovery-bill-into-law-with.php">passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> (ARRA) [JURIST report]. The act originally&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-hints-at-legal-action-if-us-stimulus.php">raised global concerns</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] of protectionism with its controversial&nbsp;&quot;Buy American&quot; clause requiring that all goods used in funded projects to be made in the US. The bill has since been&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/senate-amends-buy-american-stimulus.php">amended</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] to clarify that the law will be applied consistently with US obligations under international trade agreements.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN assistant secretary general for legal affairs Peter Taksoe-Jensen stated Monday that significant progress was made during <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009022324354/National-news/KRT-graft-talks-reopen.html">discussions of corruption</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> report] alleged to exist in the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia </a>(ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>].  Taksoe-Jensen <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gaF3K_3vZWbrJWtULu-ktp9_g_QQ">commented</a> [AFP report] that he and Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://khmergovernmentoffice.org/eng/khmer/biography.php">Sok An</a> [official profile] had gone over a possible anti-corruption mechanism for the court. The ECCC was created in 2006 to try former <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Khmer+Rouge+regime">news archive</a>] leaders, but has faced repeated allegations of <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trials-at-risk-of.php">kickbacks</a> and other irregularities, which judges for the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-judges-deny.php">deny</a> [JURIST reports].   Also Monday, US governance monitor Global Integrity released a <a href="http://report.globalintegrity.org/Cambodia/2008/">report</a> [text] rating Cambodia as &quot;Weak&quot; in the areas of Anti-Corruption and Rule of Law. <br /><br />Some believe that such allegations of corruption are a leading cause of the ECCC&#39;s extreme financial difficulties, discouraging potential donors from contributing funds. Despite Japan&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/japan-promises-more-aid-to-cambodia.php">pledge</a> [JURIST report] of an additional $21 million in January, it is feared that the court may be bankrupt in less than a month.  The ECCC announced last June that it <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-aims-to.php">planned to end its operations</a> [JURIST report] a year early because of limited funding.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Army Sgt. <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Michael+Leahy+Jr.">Michael Leahy Jr.</a> [JURIST news archive] was convicted Friday on <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/three-us-soldiers-charged-with-murder.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] stemming from the 2007 deaths of four Iraqi detainees, and was given a life sentence at a court-martial at a US military base in Germany. Leahy will have a possibility of parole after being dishonorably discharged, having his rank reduced to private, and forfeiting his pay. The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-soldier-murder-trial-21feb21,0,7494413.story">medic from Illinois</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> report] had admitted to shooting one of the prisoners but pleaded not guilty to charges of premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit premeditated murder, and obstruction of justice, claiming his lack of sleep and long-term presence in a war zone had made him unable to reason properly.<br /><br />On Tuesday, a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-soldier-to-testify-against-alleged.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Staff Sgt. Jess Cunningham, who had been accused as a co-conspirator before his charges were dropped, would be allowed to testify against Leahy. Leahy was among six members of the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th Infantry</a> [unit website] accused in killings that took place between March 10 and April 16, 2007. The prisoners were allegedly shot in the head while bound and blindfolded before being dumped in a canal. Fellow unit members Spc. Belmor Ramon and Spc. Steven Ribordy pleaded guilty to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy.php">conspiracy</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-accessory.php">accessory to murder</a> [JURIST reports], respectively, in connection with the incident.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A report prepared for the Pentagon by US Navy <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=295">Admiral Patrick Walsh</a> [official profile] has  concluded that the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay detention center</a> [JURIST news archive] meets the requirements of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials], according to Friday statements from US officials who have reviewed the document. The report, which has not been released, was prepared by the Pentagon in response to President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">January 22 executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] requiring the closure of the Guantanamo facility within one year. The report is believed to contain <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/us/21gitmo.html?ref=us">recommendations</a> [NYT report] to alleviate solitary conditions in the prison by increasing the ability of detainees to speak with each other and congregate in communal spaces. The report also approved certain <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/20/AR2009022002191.html?hpid=moreheadlines">controversial tactics</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] used at the facility, including the force feeding of inmates engaged in hunger strikes, and the placement of high-risk detainees in isolation.<br /><br />Walsh was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52940">chosen</a> [Pentagon press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-navy-admiral-to-review-guantanamo.php">report</a>] to lead the assessment of operations last month by Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Robert Gates</a> [official profile], pursuant to the January 22 executive order. Last week, the Obama administration announced that it had taken the first step towards closure of the Guantanamo facility by beginning a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-begins-review-of.php">review of detainees</a> [JURIST report] being held at the prison. The January 22 order called for the review to be conducted by a &quot;Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition,&quot; which includes US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] and Gates as co-chairs. The review is intended to determine the options available in regards to the prosecution, transfer, or other dispositions of detainees, along with providing an assessment of detention policies. In addition, the order instructed Gates immediately to halt <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">news archive</a>] proceedings pending the comprehensive review, but did not specify where detainees would go upon release. The order also called for diplomatic efforts with foreign states in order to facilitate the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human rights group <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Monday called for the UN to place an arms embargo on Israel and Hamas, responding to the UN&#39;s <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE15/012/2009/en/3301b5c0-189b-4ba2-9bca-68e116fd590f/mde150122009en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] that both parties used foreign-supplied weapons during the recent fighting in Gaza.  The UN found that weapons from more than 20 countries were used during the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=israel%2C+gaza">Gaza conflict</a> [JURIST news archive], resulting in the deaths of hundreds of children and other civilians.  The US is the largest supplier of weapons to Israel, and a current 10-year agreement between the countries specifies that the US <a href="http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1066231.html">will supply Israel with $30 billion in military aid</a> [Haaretz report].  AI asserts that the US supplied Israel with <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/wp.htm">white phosphorus</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and other weapons used to allegedly commit <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report] and other violations of international humanitarian law.  The report called for a series of actions to cease the supply of arms: <blockquote>Impose immediately a comprehensive UN Security Council arms embargo on Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups until effective mechanisms are in place to ensure that weapons or munitions and other military equipment will not be used to commit serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This must include ensuring that alleged violations are thoroughly and impartially investigated and accountability, with any persons who are found responsible being brought to justice in fair trials. [sic]</blockquote><a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo </a> [official profile] is attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes.  Under the ICC&#39;s <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], jurisdiction in a matter can only be transferred to the court when it involves a recognized, signatory state, or by special approval of the UN Security Council. Israel does not recognize the court, and in the past Moreno-Ocampo has said that the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/icc-has-no-jurisdiction-to-investigate.php">lacked jurisdiction over the alleged crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, he indicated that the court was nonetheless <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-prosecutor-reviewing-options-for.php">making a &quot;preliminary analysis&quot;</a> [JURIST report] of the situation.  Israel has already begun to consider <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US Army Special Forces soldier facing <a href="/currentawareness/militaryjustice.php">court-martial proceedings</a> [JURIST news archive] over the killing of an Afghan civilian in March 2008 has admitted to killing the man but argued during opening statements Thursday that the act was committed in self-defense. Master Sgt. Robert Newell of the <a href="http://www.groups.sfahq.com/3rd/index.htm">3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne)</a> [unit website] was <a href="http://news.soc.mil/releases/News%20Archive/2008/September/080918-01.html">arraigned</a> [press release] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-special-forces-soldier-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with killing the unidentified Afghan and mutilating the corpse by cutting off an ear. Military prosecutors allege that the killing was premeditated, and that the civilian posed no threat to Newell. On Friday, an Afghan who served as a translator to Newell&#39;s Special Forces team <a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/article?id=319178">testified</a> [<em>Fayetteville Observer</em> report] that the victim had his hands in his pockets while being questioned and subsequently shot by Newell, and that the victim&#39;s hands remained in his pockets after the killing. According to defense lawyers, Newell believed the unidentified Afghan to be a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=taliban">Taliban</a> [JURIST news archive] insurgent who posed a threat to him. Newell is being charged with <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#918.118">murder</a> and <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#934.134">related offenses</a> [text] under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br /><br />In 2007, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/aclu-releases-us-army-documents-on.php">released documents</a> [JURIST report] describing alleged crimes committed by US soldiers against civilians in <a href="/countries/iraq.php">Iraq</a> and <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archive], but showing that troops believed they were following the law in most instances. The materials were made available in conjunction with a lawsuit the ACLU filed to compel the US military to release all documents relating to the deaths of civilians caused by US troops since January 2005. In 2006, court-martial proceedings against a group of US soldiers implicated in the abuse of detainees at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/us-soldier-convicted-of-abusing-afghan.php">ended with only one conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Three other soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/military-interrogator-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to abusing prisoners at Bagram, two others pleaded guilty at the court-martial and five were acquitted. The Army dropped the charges against three others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday unanimously <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/20/0716620.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion text, PDF] a US District Court <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/bc83a5777591b96f88256d480060b73c/43d59eb467206a118825733000649179/$FILE/VSDA.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-judge-issues-permanent.php">report</a>] that a California <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1179_bill_20051007_chaptered.pdf">law</a> [text, PDF] banning sales of video games to minors is unconstitutional because it is a violation of First Amendment free speech rights. In <u>Video Software Dealers Assoc. v. Schwarzenegger</u>, the appellants, a group of California state officials, argued for a reduced standard of review based on US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] precedent in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/390/629/"><u>Ginsberg v. New York</u></a> [opinion text]. The Ninth Circuit refused to apply the lower &#8220;variable obscenity&#8221; standard from <u>Ginsberg</u> instead of strict scrutiny based on the differences between sexually explicit content, which was the subject in <u>Ginsberg</u>, and violent content. In its opinion the court also found that the appellants did not meet the strict scrutiny standard by presenting a compelling state interest which was narrowly tailored:<blockquote>In sum, the evidence presented by the State does not support the Legislature&#8217;s purported interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm... [n]one of the research establishes or suggests a causal link between minors playing violent video games and actual psychological or neurological harm, and inferences to that effect would not be reasonable. In fact, some of the studies caution against inferring causation. Although we do not require the State to demonstrate a &#8220;scientific certainty,&#8221; the State must come forward with more than it has. As a result, the State has not met its burden to demonstrate a compelling interest.<br /><br />Instead of focusing its argument on the possibility of less restrictive means, the State obscures the analysis by focusing on the &#8220;most effective&#8221; means, which it asserts is the one thousand dollar penalty imposed for each violation. Further, the State does not acknowledge the possibility that an enhanced education campaign about the ESRB rating system directed at retailers and parents would help achieve government interests. Even assuming that the State&#8217;s interests in enacting the Act are sufficient, the State has not demonstrated why less restrictive means would not forward its interests. The Act, therefore, is not narrowly tailored.</blockquote>The bill, originally signed into law by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in October 2005, prohibited the sale or rental of violent video games to minors under the age of 17, and required retailers to label violent games. In December 2005, US District Court Judge Ronald Whyte issued a <A src="/paperchase/2005/10/industry-groups-sue-over-california.php">temporary injunction</A> [JURIST report] against the enforcement of the law after the <a href="http://www.theesa.com/">Entertainment Software Association</a> (ESA) and the <a href="http://www.idealink.org/Resource.phx/public/aboutvsda.htx">Video Software Dealers Association</a> (VSDA) [trade websites] <A src="/paperchase/2005/10/industry-groups-sue-over-california.php">filed a lawsuit</A> [JURIST report; EMA <a href="http://www.entmerch.org/schwarzenneger.html">backgrounder</a>]. Judges have struck down similar laws as unconstitutional in <A src="/paperchase/2006/04/michigan-violent-video-games-ban-ruled.php">Michigan</A>, <A src="/paperchase/2005/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-illinois.php">Illinois</A>, <A src="/paperchase/2006/07/federal-judge-rejects-minnesota-adult.php">Minnesota</A>, and <A src="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-judge-issues-injunction.php">Louisiana</A> [JURIST reports].

The complaint also contained &quot;a request for the indication of provisional measures in order to protect [Belgium&#39;s]  rights&quot; until the matter is resolved.  Belgium filed the complaint to advance either the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senegal-14-file-war-crimes-complaints.php">planned Senegalese trial</a> [JURIST report] or the current Belgian case against Habre, and alleges that: <blockquote>Senegal&#8217;s failure to prosecute Mr. H. Habre, if he is not extradited to Belgium to answer for the acts of torture that are alleged against him, violates the [United Nations] Convention against Torture.</blockquote>Under Article 30 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture</a> [text], any dispute concerning the Convention may be resolved by the ICJ.<br /><br />Senegal has dealt with numerous suits involving Habre since his exile from Chad in 1990 and has adapted its laws to permit his prosecution. In October, lawyers for Habre filed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ex-chad-dictator-habre-attempting-to.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the court of the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] to prevent his trial for crimes against humanity in Senegal from moving forward. In August, Chad convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced Habre to death <font style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</font></a> [JURIST report] for crimes against the state but did not seek extradition. Since 2005, Belgium and Senegal have been engaged in a legal battle over Habre because Senegal has <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused extradition</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suriname">Suriname</a> [JURIST news archive] dictator <a href="http://www.parbo.com/information/who.html#bou">Desi Bouterse</a> [backgrounder] resumed Friday with testimony by a former prison warden that he brought a leader of a 1982 military coup to an army barracks for execution. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jZHEs98SAqhddcYQPjqe_yh9q5Gg">testimony</a> [AFP report] of the former warden of Suriname&#39;s Santo Boma prison, a former military officer under Bouterse, came during the ongoing trial of Bouterse for the so-called &quot;December Murders&quot; of 15 of Bouterse&#39;s political opponents by the military regime at Fort Zeelandia, Paramarimbo in 1982. The trial <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/suriname-ex-military-dictator-goes-on.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in July 2008, and has already included testimony by Bouterse&#39;s former bodyguard Onno Flohr that the former dictator was present at the killings. Bouterse, who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/suriname-tribunal-backs-charges-against.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in April 2008 and faces up to 20 years in prison, has staunchly denied his involvement, insisting that he was not present at the military compound at the time of the shootings.<br /><br />Bouterse seized control of northeastern South American state of Suriname during a military coup in 1980, five years after the country achieved independence from the Netherlands. He stepped down in 1987 in the face of international pressure and briefly seized power in 1991. He is now the leader of the county&#8217;s primary opposition party, the <a href="http://www.ndp.sr/">National Democratic Party</a> [official website, in Dutch], which is preparing for the 2010 presidential elections.

Chen was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> on charges of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering in December, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-on-hunger.php">staged an earlier hunger strike</a> to protest the allegations when he was first <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-arrested-on.php">detained</a> [JURIST reports] in November. Chen has maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated, and in January <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully</a> [JURIST report] appealed his pretrial detention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the Khamovnichesky District Court in Moscow on Thursday ordered former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] to be transferred to the Russian capital to face <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">new charges</a> [JURIST report] including embezzlement and theft, according to court officials. Both Khodorkovsky and his former partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are to be transferred from the Siberian region of Chita, where both men have been serving prison sentences based on 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-six.php">convictions</a> [JURIST report] for fraud and tax evasion. A <a href="http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/1010/42/374699.htm">preliminary hearing on the charges is set</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report] for March 3 at the Khamovnichesky Court. Khodorkovsky&#39;s lawyers called the charges baseless, and several critics believe they are politically motivated based on Khordorkovsky&#39;s opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive]. Also this week, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] published its January <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=19498790&skin=hudoc-en">decision</a> [text] to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/business/20090218/120198397.html">accept a $34 billion lawsuit</a> [RIA Novosti] filed in 2004 by former managers of Khodorkovsky&#39;s company <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040719-662739,00.html">OAO Yukos Oil Co.</a> [TIME backgrounder]. The complaint alleged that the tax charges against Yukos, which led the company to bankruptcy, were part of an illegal effort by the Russian government to seize the company. In accepting the claims, the court rejected arguments by the Russian government that the complaint should not be heard because the claimants failed to exhaust all appeals in Russian courts and that that the company did not legally existed after 2007.<br /><br />Khodorkovsky was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 for fraud and tax evasion, charges which he still denies. Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">applied for early release</a> last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] by a Russian judge in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges. Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that decision in September.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish Minister of Justice <a href="http://www.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite?cid=1160559581663&pagename=Portal_del_ciudadano/OrgSubSeccionMJ/Tpl_OrgSubSeccionMJ&p=&menu_activo=1152882050659%E2%8C%A9=es_es">Mariano Fernandez Bermejo</a> [official profile, in Spanish] resigned on Monday due to mounting pressure following allegations that he interfered with a judicial investigation during a hunting trip with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Judge Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>]. The hunting expedition occurred just days before the launch of Garzon&#39;s investigation into corruption charges against the conservative <a href="http://www.pp.es/index.asp">Popular Party</a> (PP) [official website, in Spanish], but Bermejo maintained that it was a mere coincidence that he and Gardon were on the trip together. Bermejo said Monday that he <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Bermejo/dimite/ministro/Justicia/elpepuesp/20090223elpepunac_4/Tes">decided to resign</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] because he believed that it would be easier for someone else to do the job amid the controversy. Current Secretary for Constitutional and Parliamentary Affairs Francisco Caamano is <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Francisco/Caamano/nuevo/ministro/Justicia/elpepuesp/20090223elpepunac_6/Tes">expected to be named</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] as Bermejo&#39;s successor.<br /><br />Prior to his resignation, Bermejo had been criticized for his handling of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/spain-judges-strike-to-protest-workload.php">judiciary strike</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Judges from more than 30 Spanish provinces went on a one-day strike to demand the hiring of more judges and the adoption of electronic technology to decrease their workload. The effort, known as the <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/10/19/espana/1224445685.html">October 8 Movement</a> [<em>El Mundo</em> report, in Spanish; AJFV <a href="http://www.ajfv.es/actualidad">materials</a>, in Spanish], was sparked by the fine a Huelva judge incurred in <a href="http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/espana/noticias/803537/10/08/El-juez-del-caso-Mari-Luz-rechaza-responsabilidades-disciplinarias.html">October 2008</a> [EcoDiario report, in Spanish] for delay in issuing an arrest order for a suspect who later killed a small child. Bermejo had said that he intended to propose a law limiting the ways in which judges may assert their rights, given their role in the government. The judges planned to challenge any such law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall.html">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb09.shtml">briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1410.pdf">United States v. Navajo Nation</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether the Court&#39;s earlier <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/537/488/case.html">decision</a> [text] in the case foreclosed a decision by the US <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] that the US federal government breached its fiduciary duties in connection with coal leases and is liable to the Navajo Nation for as much as $600 million. The Navajo litigation began in 1993, when the Navajo Nation sued the US government for a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/usc_sec_25_00000396----000-.html">Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938</a> (IMLA) [text], alleging that the Secretary of the Interior breached fiduciary duties to the Nation when he communicated with a mining company with whom the Nation had negotiated a coal mining lease during a pending appeal of the mining company&#39;s appeal of a Department of the Interior order confirming the terms of the lease. As a result of those communications, the lease between the Navajo Nation and the mining company was renegotiated at terms substantially less favorable to the Nation than the originally approved lease. The case has a complex procedural history, having been argued in both the US <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit twice, as well as the Supreme Court. Counsel for the respondent argued:<blockquote>... [T]he Secretary did owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section (a) [of the IMLA]. That program did not end. That disclosure responsibility did not end. What the measure of damages for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is still open on remand. But the notion that the Secretary can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which is to know that he was not going to take personal jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no decision be made, leave the Navajo in a state of distress under those circumstances, force them to negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a minimum, and then handed up an agreement that was half what the fair market value would have been for the quality of coal is an outrage, and the Court ought to allow the damages action to go forward. ... I urge the Court to affirm.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-9995.pdf">Rivera v. Illinois</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether an Illinois trial court erred in refusing to grant a defense counsel&#39;s peremptory challenge to dismiss from a murder trial a juror who worked at a hospital that treated a larger number of gunshot wounds. After raising the challenge during jury selection, the trial court overruled the challenge and seated the juror. At the start of the trial, defense counsel again challenged the juror in juror&#39;s presence. That challenge was again denied, and the juror was appointed foreperson of the jury, with knowledge that the defendant&#39;s counsel had attempted to remove her from the jury. Rivera was found guilty of murder, and sentenced to 85 years in prison. The <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/appellatecourt/">Illinois Appellate Court</a> [official website] affirmed the conviction, rejecting the assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the peremptory challenge. After remand to the trial court, the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Supreme Court of Illinois</a> [official website], while noting that the challenge should have been granted, affirmed the verdict, holding that the trial court&#39;s error was harmless. Matthew Roberts, US Assistant to the Solicitor General appearing as amicus curiae supporting the respondent, argued:<blockquote>Federal law does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because the denial of a peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law rights. And even if his Federal constitutional rights had been violated, harmless error review would apply. The Constitution does not give criminal defendants the right to peremptory challenges; therefore, a -- the right of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise peremptory challenges derives entirely from State law, and when erroneous denial of a preemptory [sic] challenge deprives him only of State law right, and when the State law rights alone have been violated, State law not federal law dictates whether harmless error review applies. The violation of a State law right doesn&#39;t rise to a due process -- federal due process violation unless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial. And this Court has repeatedly held that States can withhold preemptory [sic] challenges entirely without impairing the right to an impartial jury or a fair trial. It, therefore, follows that the erroneous denial of a single preemptory [sic] challenge does not render a trial fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt on Sunday called for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to delay issuing an arrest warrant for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] for a least a year, in order to allow peace talks between the Sudanese government and Darfur rebels to continue. A spokesman for <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.eg/">Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak</a> [official website] said that the call came out of Sunday talks between Bashir and Mubarak, and that Egypt has already been urging other leaders to help postpone or prevent the warrant&#39;s issuance. ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] has long <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">sought an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Bashir on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and the ICC is expected to decide soon whether or not to issue the warrant.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the ICC announced that it&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/no%20decision%20concerning%20possible%20arrest%20warrant%20against%20president%20al%20bashir%20of%20sudan">had not issued an arrest warrant</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-denies-reports-that-bashir-arrest.php">report</a>] Bashir, despite a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html?ref=world">report</a> [NYT report] that it had.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar&#39;s military government has granted amnesty to 23 political detainees and more than 6,300 other prisoners, Thailand-based human rights group <a href="http://www.aappb.org/">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</a> (AAPP) [advocacy website] said Sunday. Among those freed were members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, including <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=15169">Zaw Myint Maung</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Irrawaddy</span> report], who had been imprisoned for more than 18 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Myanmar&#39;s government said Friday that the prisoners were released due to good behavior and also to allow the country to <a href="http://myamarnews.blogspot.com/2009/02/burma-begins-to-release-prisoners.html">hold fair elections</a> [BNN report] in 2010.&nbsp;The prisoners&#39; release follows a visit by UN Human Rights envoy to Myanmar <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/index.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official website], which also coincided with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15140">reduction of the prison sentences</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Irrawaddy</span> report] of several political activists last week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/default.asp>Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] Wednesday upheld a lower court ruling that bars <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif>Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive], former prime minister and current leader of the opposition <a href=http://www.pmln.org.pk/>Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website], from holding elected office based on a past criminal conviction for &quot;hijacking&quot;. Sharif was convicted of the offense for attempting to divert a plane carrying Army commander Pervez Musharraf during a 1999 coup against Sharif that ultimately succeeded. Sharif said the <a href=http://www.pmln.org.pk/news_detail.php?id=1254>ruling was retributive</a> [PML-N press release] and that <a href=http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/>President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari>news archive</a>] offered him a favorable verdict in exchange for his support of <a href=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=480>Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar</a> [official website]. Wednesday&#39;s <a href="http://dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/supreme-court-rules-against-sharif-brothers--qs">decision</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] also nullified the election of Sharif&#39;s brother, Shahbaz Sharif, who had served as the Chief Minister of Punjab since his election last June. The removal of Shahbaz Sharif from office may be viewed as a political power-grab, as Punjab is the most populous and affluent region in Pakistan, and the PML-N holds a sizable plurality over Zardari&#39;s <a href=http://www.ppp.org.pk/>Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) [party website] in its provincial assembly.<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s controversial ruling comes amid much turmoil regarding the country&#39;s judiciary, which has split the PML-N and PPP, which formerly were <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php>coalition partners</a> [JURIST report]. Sharif and the PML-N have urged the restoration of Chief Justice <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry>Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], ousted after then-president Pervez Musharraf declared emergency rule in November 2007.

During his visit, Holder reviewed cases against specific detainees, toured the facilities which had housed the military commission proceedings, and was joined by <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-ag-148.html">newly-appointed</a> [DOJ release] Guantanamo Detainee Review Task Force (GDRTF) Executive Director Matthew Olsen. In a Friday release announcing Olsen&#39;s appointment and the creation of GDRTF, Holden said that Olsen will be responsible for reviewing each detainee&#39;s&nbsp;case and coordinating the government&#39;s actions accordingly:<blockquote>As a leader of the Department&#8217;s National Security Division and 12-year career federal prosecutor, Mr. Olsen has the experience and judgment to lead the team&#8217;s evaluation of these individual cases... We&#8217;ve established a solid framework for the administration to make the right decision on each individual detainee -- decisions that will most effectively serve the interests of justice and the national security and foreign policy objectives of the United States.</blockquote>The Obama administration announced earlier this month that it had begun the process of <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-begins-review-of.php">reviewing detainees&#39; cases</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />Both Holder&#39;s visit to Guantanamo and his creation of the GDRTF are part of the DOJ&#39;s efforts to carry out US President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">January 22 executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] freezing the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">news archive</a>] system, calling for the review of US judicial policy towards the detainees, and ordering the closure of Guantanamo within one year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Paris appeals court on Tuesday overturned the 2007 terrorism convictions of five French citizens who had been questioned by French officials while detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court held that counter-terrorism agents from the French national security service <a href="http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_l_interieur/la_police_nationale/organisation/dst">DST</a> [official website, in French] could not gather intelligence and conduct a criminal investigation at the same time. The defendants, Brahim Yadel, Mourad Benchellali, Nizar Sassi, Khaled ben Mustapha and Redouane Khalid, had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/former-guantanamo-detainees-convicted.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of &quot;criminal association with a terrorist enterprise&quot; and sentenced to one year in prison. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gwcsgM2Hg4WO9R9KwITZi7KWuPywD96I5R700">plan to appeal</a> [AP report] the ruling to France&#39;s <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French].<br /><br />The court&#39;s ruling had been <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/france-court-postpones-ruling-on-former.php">postponed</a> in January, after US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">ordered the closure of the Guantanamo detention center</a> [JURIST reports]. France <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/former-french-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">charged the defendants</a> [JURIST report] in April 2006, and during their original September 2006 trial, the judge <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/france-judge-postpones-terrorism.php">refused to deliver a verdict</a> [JURIST report], explaining that he wanted to know more about the intelligence-gathering mission in which agents interviewed the men at Guantanamo. The French government at first <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/france-defends-undisclosed-meetings.php">failed to disclose the meetings</a> [JURIST report], which came to light during the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/retrial-of-six-former-guantanamo.php">retrial</a> [JURIST report] when a French diplomatic telegram published in the <em>Liberation</em> daily referred to at least two such interviews.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] were blocked from attending a scheduled Tuesday meeting with Khadr at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].  Officials have launched an investigation into the ethics of the defense team, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kuebler">Navy Lt. Cmdr. Bill Kuebler</a> [JURIST news archive], a military lawyer for Khadr, e-mailed media outlets to state that the investigation was prompted by his own criticism of lead defense counsel Air Force Col. Peter Masciola. Kuebler accused Masciola of having a disqualifying conflict of interest after Masciola allegedly implied that Khadr should face an additional civil trial, contradicting the position of the defense team that Khadr should return to Canada for rehabilitation. Deputy defense lawyer Michael Berrigan <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/592720">denied</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> report] that any such conflict of interest exists, and the entire defense team declined to discuss the specifics of the investigation. Officials confirmed that an investigation is underway but did not give further details. Also Tuesday, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon announced that <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090225.CANNON25/TPStory/TPInternational/America/">Canada will not seek Khadr&#39;s return</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report] and will await the outcome of the US proceedings before making further decisions regarding Khadr.  <br /><br />The military commission proceedings against Khadr are currently <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/P%20011.pdf">suspended</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/military-judges-grant-obamas-motion-to.php">report</a>] until May at the behest of US President Barack Obama. Earlier this month, Khadr&#39;s defense team presented a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/khadr-lawyers-propose-plan-for.php">plan to return him</a> [JURIST report] to Canada, a proposal <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/pdf/090211_omarkhadr_letter.pdf">supported by opposition members</a> [open letter, PDF] of the Canadian House of Commons. Khadr has <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/khadr-admitted-throwing-grenade-that.php">admitted to throwing a hand grenade</a> [JURIST report] that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan, and was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href=http://www.usdoj.gov/>Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) lawyers on Monday asked the <a href=http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/>US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official websites] to revisit a January decision in which a three-judge panel <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/01/fourth-circuit-finds-federal-civil.php>ruled</a> [JURIST report] that indefinite civil commitment of &quot;sexually dangerous&quot; offenders was unconstitutional. The DOJ now <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbWKFtDcXrsrysnDyoLpbnxqNxRwD96HI8P82">seeks an <span style="font-style:italic;">en banc</span> ruling</a> [AP report] on the case, and is disputing the panel&#39;s <a href=http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/077671.P.pdf>holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that civil commitment powers belong to the states. The government had unsuccessfully argued that federal power of civil commitment came from the <a href=http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag31_user.html#art1_sec8cl3>Commerce Clause</a> and the <a href=http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag86_user.html#art1_sec8cl18>Necessary and Proper Clause</a> [texts].<br /><br />January&#39;s ruling invalidated part of the <a href=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4472>Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act</a> [text], which also <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/07/bill-establishing-online-national-sex.php>established a national sex offender registry</a> [JURIST report]. This month, a federal district court ruled the <a href=http://www.ojp.gov/smart/faqs/faqs_general.pdf>Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [DOJ backgrounder], which imposes penalties for failing to register, <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/02/federal-judge-rules-sex-offender.php>was also unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc635503.pdf">announced</a> [public notice, text] Monday that a long-awaited decision on a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant">controversial arrest warrant</a> [JURIST news archive] sought for Sudanese head of state <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/820864.stm#leaders">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] would be rendered on March 4. The court said that &quot;[c]onsidering that there have been numerous rumors over the past weeks on the possible date and outcome of this decision [and that]... this Chamber is deeply concerned about such rumors...&quot;,  it would issue its ruling on the matter publicly. Earlier this month, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html">reported</a> that the warrant had been issued, leading court official to quickly <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-denies-reports-that-bashir-arrest.php">issue a denial</a> [JURIST report]. In an effort to promote Darfur peace talks, Egypt Sunday called on the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-joins-calls-for-icc-to-delay.php">postpone its decision</a> [JURIST report] on the arrest warrant.  <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> [JURIST reports] have also called for the proceedings against al-Bashir to be delayed. <br /><br />The warrant ruling is in connection with preliminary <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc559999.pdf">charges</a> [text, PDF] against al-Bashir filed by ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo in July 2008 alleging genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed in the Darfur region in violation of Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. Al-Bashir is accused of systematically targeting and purging the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa, three Arabic-speaking ethnic groups, under the pretext of counterinsurgency since 2003. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already urged  al-Bashir to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-sg-urges-bashir-to-comply-with.php">comply</a> [JURIST report] with the forthcoming ICC decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Colombian president <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/presidente/">Alvaro Uribe</a> [official profile, in Spanish] on Monday denied ordering <a href="http://www.das.gov.co/">Department of Administrative Security</a> (DAS) [official website, in Spanish] agents to conduct wiretaps on politicians, judges and journalists.   Journalists from the Colombian magazine <a href="http://www.semana.com/home.aspx"><span style="font-style:italic;">Semana</span></a> [official website, in Spanish] were the first to publish the allegations, and have stated that certain recordings have already been destroyed.  Some fear that remaining tapes may get into the hands of criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, paramilitary groups, or guerrillas.  Also Monday, the headquarters of the DAS was searched in an attempt to discover who may have ordered and used the information obtained from the illegal wiretaps. Several top DAS officials have resigned due to the scandal, and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iCJ9wZ40rXrPv9ghQwUHWOf_guVAD96IARVG0">two more deputy directors left the agency</a> [AP report] on Tuesday. <br /><br />This scandal is not the first to link Uribe with illegal wiretapping.  Last year, Uribe and his administration were cleared of <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/colombia-minister-admits-illegal.php">similar allegations</a> [JURIST report] after claiming they were unaware of a plan to record journalists, opposition members, and government officials, and that they did not use the resulting transcripts. In March 2007, Colombian authorities arrested <a href="http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/blog/archives/000242.htm">Jorge Noguera</a> [CIP backgrounder], a former intelligence chief heading the DAS, on charges of murder and conspiracy for<a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-ruling-may-disrupt.php"> allegedly contracting with illegal paramilitary groups</a> to assassinate political opponents, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/amnesty-blasts-colombia-protections.php">human rights activists</a> [JURIST reports] and union leaders.  He <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4378326.stm">resigned</a> [BBC report] in October 2005 after he was taped while discussing plans to sell DAS intelligence data to paramilitary groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Internet search company <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google, Inc.</a> [corporate website] will apply to join a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] antitrust proceeding against <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/default.mspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate website], accusing the software giant of hindering competition, according to a <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/02/browsers-powered-by-user-choice.html">message from Google Vice President Sundar Pichai</a> [text] posted to the company&#39;s official blog Tuesday.  On January 17, the EC confirmed that it <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/15&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">sent a Statement of Objections</a> (SO) [EC press release] to Microsoft, preliminarily concluding that by tying its Internet Explorer web browser to the Windows operating system, Microsoft &quot;provides Internet Explorer with an artificial distribution advantage which other web browsers are unable to match,&quot; thus undermining competition in violation of an EC Treaty <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E082:EN:HTML">provision on the abuse of a dominant position</a> [Article 82 text]. Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/jan09/01-16statement.mspx">responded</a> [press release] that it is committed to operating &quot;in full compliance with European law&quot; and indicated that it is &quot;studying&quot; the confidential SO. Pichai said that Google seeks to join the proceedings because <blockquote>Google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive, which holds back innovation for users. This is because Internet Explorer is tied to Microsoft&#39;s dominant computer operating system, giving it an unfair advantage over other browsers. Compare this to the mobile market, where Microsoft cannot tie Internet Explorer to a dominant operating system, and its browser therefore has a much lower usage. The value of competition for users (even in the limited form we see today) is clear: tabbed browsing, faster downloads, private browsing features, and more. Even greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design, enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications.<br /><br />Finally, we believe that we can contribute to this debate. We learned a lot from launching our own Google Chrome browser last year and are hoping that Google&#39;s perspective will be useful as the European Commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices. Of course creating a remedy that helps solve one problem without creating other unintended consequences isn&#39;t easy - but the more voices there are in the conversation the greater the chances of success.</blockquote>The SO allows Microsoft eight weeks to reply to the allegations in writing or to request an oral hearing. If the preliminary views of the SO are confirmed, the EC may require that Microsoft cease its infringement and may assess a fine.  <br /><br />The SO is based on legal principles confirmed in a <a href="/paperchase/2004_03_24_indexarch.htm#108013383120399834">2004 European Commission action</a> [JURIST report; EC <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/microsoft/">materials</a>] against Microsoft that directed the company to unbundle its media player from its Windows operating system. That landmark ruling required Microsoft to share technical information with competitors and lower its prices, but Microsoft failed to comply with the judgment and the EC assessed a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/318&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">record fine</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eu-levies-13b-fine-against-microsoft.php">report</a>] of 899 million euros ($1.3 billion). Last May, Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/microsoft-appeals-eu-antitrust-fine.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/txtdocfr/index_tpi.htm">European Court of First Instance</a> [official website], seeking to annul the fine. In response to the European decision and other judgments, Microsoft has instituted an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/corporategovernance/committees/antitrust.mspx">Antitrust Compliance Committee</a> [official website]. Last June, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/china-begins-anti-monopoly.php">China announced an anti-monopoly investigation</a> [JURIST report] of Microsoft for allegedly dominating the Chinese software market, unfairly raising prices, and bundling software.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/lebanon/tribunal/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> [official website] will begin work on March 1, according to the Tribunal&#39;s Registrar, <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/Vincent_bio.pdf">Robin Vincent</a> [official profile, PDF]. The March 1 start date for the court, established at the request of the Lebanese government after the February 14, 2005 assassination of <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri</a> [JURIST news archive], will coincide with the scheduled arrival of prosecutor <a href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/11/canadian_prosec.php">Daniel Bellemare</a> [<em>Ya Libnan</em> profile] in The Hague. In a televised interview on Monday, Vincent said that in May, the Tribunal will ask the Lebanese government to <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=99597">transfer four generals</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report] being held on suspicion of involvement in Hariri&#39;s assassination to the court&#39;s custody.<br /><br />The Special Tribunal will consist of 11 international and Lebanese judges, be <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/un-netherlands-ink-hariri-tribunal.php">based at The Hague</a> and have a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-secures-first-year-funding-for.php">budget of $51 million</a> for its first year [JURIST reports]. While no indictments have been issued, Bellemare, a Canadian prosecutor who headed the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8353.doc.htm">International Independent Investigation Commission</a> (IIIC) [authorizing resolution; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=110&Body=Leban&Body1=">materials</a>], believes a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-commission-suspects-criminal-network.php">criminal network was behind the plot</a> [JURIST report]. The investigation has increased tensions between Lebanon and Syria as several IIIC reports have <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-hariri-investigator-asks-security.php">implicated Syrian officials</a> in Hariri&#39;s death [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decided three cases Tuesday. The Court ruled 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-608">United States v. Hayes</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder;  JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-sentencing-gun-law.php">report</a>] that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000922----000-.html">federal gun law</a> [18 USC &sect; 922(g)(9), text] that prohibits anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence from possessing a firearm does not require that a domestic relationship between an attacker and victim be a specific element of the crime. Hayes, a West Virginia man arrested for owning a firearm ten years after pleading guilty to the misdemeanor battery of his wife, argued that because the statute specifically mentioned domestic battery crimes, applying it to general crimes would unfairly subject an offender to additional criminal charges. Reversing an <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/064087.P.pdf">earlier decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website], the Court held that Congress&#39; intent in writing the law was mostly likely to focus on the wrongful actions of the offender rather than the particular charges of which they had been convicted:<blockquote>Most sensibly read, then, &sect;921(a)(33)(A) defines &#8220;misdemeanor crime of domestic violence&#8221; as a misdemeanor offense that (1) &#8220;has, as an element, the use [of force],&#8221; and (2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim. To obtain a conviction in a &sect;922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant&#8217;s current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way. But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.</blockquote>Read the Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-608.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] per Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-608.ZD.html">dissent</a> filed by Chief Justice John Roberts.<br /><br />In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-869">Ysura v. Pocatello Education Association</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-takes-two-first-amendment.php">report</a>], the Court held 6-3 that a state law prohibiting payroll deductions for political purposes does not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text]. The case was brought by a group of state employee unions who wished to challenge Idaho&#39;s <a href="http://www3.state.id.us/oasis/2003/H0329.html">Voluntary Contributions Act</a> (VCA) [text], which provides in part that &quot;deductions for political activities . . . shall not be deducted from the wages, earnings or compensation of an employee&quot;, on the grounds that it was an unconstitutional restriction on the employee&#39;s free speech. Before accepting Idaho&#39;s argument that the prohibition was intended to avoid the appearance of political favoritism, the Court held that<blockquote>[w]hile publicly administered payroll deductions for political purposes can enhance the unions&#8217; exercise of First Amendment rights, Idaho is under no obligation to aid the unions in their political activities. And the State&#8217;s decision not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions&#8217; speech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see fit. They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.</blockquote> The Court reversed a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/10/05/0635004.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], which had found that Idaho was interfering with the functions of local governments and that the statute was unconstitutional as a result. Read the Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-869.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] per Chief Justice Roberts, a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-869.ZC.html">concurrence</a> filed by Justice Ginsburg, dissents filed by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-869.ZD.html">Justice John Paul Stevens</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-869.ZD1.html">Justice David Souter</a> and a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-869.ZX.html">concurrence in part and dissent in part</a> [texts] filed by Justice Stephen Breyer.<br /><br />The Court also ruled 6-3 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-526">Carcieri v. Salazar</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/supreme-court-to-hear-car-search-tribal.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/welcome.html">Secretary of the Interior</a> [official profile], was not authorized to take land in Charlestown, Rhode Island, to accept in trust for the use of the <a href="www.narragansett-tribe.org">Narragansett Indians</a> [tribe website] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/usc_sec_25_00000479----000-.html">Indian Reorganization Act of 1934</a> (IRA) [25 USC 479 text]. The Court interpreted the IRA&#39;s phrase &quot;now under Federal jurisdiction&quot; to refer to the time of the statute&#39;s enactment, and therefore to limit the Secretary of the Interior&#39;s ability to accept land in trust to those tribes recognized by federal authorities in 1934. Finding that the Narragansett had been assimilated into Rhode Island as part of an 1880 land sale, and had not regained sovereignty for federal purposes until 1983, the Court held that: <blockquote>[the IRA] limits the Secretary&#8217;s authority to taking land into trust for the purpose of providing land to members of a tribe that was under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted in June 1934. Because the record in this case establishes that the Narragansett Tribe was not under federal jurisdiction when the IRA was enacted, the Secretary does not have the authority to take the parcel at issue into trust.</blockquote>Tuesday&#39;s decision reversed a <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=03-2647EB.01A">July 2007 opinion</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] that &quot;now under Federal jurisdiction&quot; was ambiguous, and allowing the land trust to proceed. Read the Court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-526.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] per Justice Clarence Thomas, a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-526.ZC.html">concurrence</a> filed by Justice Breyer, a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-526.ZD.html">dissent</a> filed by Justice Stevens and a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-526.ZX.html">concurrence in part and dissent in part</a> [texts] filed by Justice Souter.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/HOME/tabid/53/Default.aspx">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/sierraleone.php">news archive</a>] prosecutor <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/ABOUT/CourtOrganization/Prosecution/tabid/90/Default.aspx">Stephen Rapp</a> [official profile] has told Reuters that lack of court funds due to the global economic downturn may require the release of former Liberian President <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/CharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">Charles Taylor</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>].  The SCSL has charged Taylor with <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">11 counts</a> [indictment, PDF] of crimes against humanity for his involvement in the Revolutionary United Front, a rebel organization allegedly responsible for the murder of Sierra Leone citizens.  The SCSL&#39;s budget comes entirely from individual donations, and it <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE51N2NF20090224?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews">expects a shortfall</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Reuters</span> report] of close to five million dollars.  Without sufficient funding, the judges in the case may be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/25/civil-war-crimes-tribunal">forced</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] to release Taylor from custody.  Should he be set free, the indictments would stand, leaving open the possibility for further legal action. <br /><br />Earlier this month, officials had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/liberia-ex-president-taylor-verdict.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they expected the court to render a verdict by 2010, despite the SCSL&#39;s ongoing financial troubles.  After <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/taylor-boycotts-opening-arguments-in.php">complaints</a> [JURIST report] of prejudice in 2007, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/taylor-allocated-100000-monthly-for.php">increased Taylor&#39;s defense funding</a> [JURIST report] to $100,000 a month.  Taylor claims to be indigent, but critics <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/taylor-not-indigent-defendant-un.php">argue</a> [JURIST report] that he has millions of dollars hidden in African banks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Swiss <a href=http://www.gruene.ch/f/index.asp>Green Party</a> [official website, in French] has collected enough signatures to force a <a href="http://www.protell.ch/Aktivbereich/01Homepage/fr/default_f.htm">referendum</a> [link to text, multilingual] on whether the country&#39;s service members should be required to keep their government-issued firearms at military compounds.  The Green Party has <a href=http://www.gruene.ch/f/aktuell/waffengewalt.asp>denounced</a> [position statement, in French] the current practice of permitting the storage of weapons at home: <blockquote>An impressive number of military weapons lie unused in Swiss cellars. No usage, whether military or sports-related, justifies their presence in the midst of the population. Far from protecting the people, these weapons represent a risk for their safety. Easily available, they contribute to increased suicides and murders.</blockquote>The proposed constitutional amendment would specially address sports shooters, gun vendors and collectors, and those whose jobs require them to use firearms. The referendum would also mandate a national firearm registry, which opponents say is too costly.<br /><br />For years, Swiss gun control advocates have pushed to <a href=http://www.iansa.org/regions/europe/Swisscampaign.htm>keep military guns out of homes</a> [IANSA backgrounder], urging the nation&#39;s <a href=http://www.parlament.ch/e/Pages/default.aspx>Parliament</a> [official website, in English] to pass a 2007 law banning the storage of military ammunition in residential buildings. The Swiss referendum process requires a minimum of 100,000 signatures on the ballot, and recent initiatives have addressed issues ranging from <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/12/switzerland-voters-approve-permanent.php>treatment for heroin addicts</a> to <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/06/switzerland-voters-reject-citizenship.php>national citizenship</a> [JURIST reports].

The <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/archivos/iniciativas/registro3590.pdf">proposed legislation</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] was presented to the Guatemalan Congress in January 2007, and was an important part of a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/english/toc.html">1999 report</a> [text] by the Commission for Historical Clarification. Prompted by the <a href="http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/guatemala/firm-lasting-peace.php">Peace Accords of 1996</a> [text], the report stated that 200,000 people were disappeared during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">30-year internal conflict</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. AI&#39;s Americas Deputy Director Kerrie Howard <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/guatemala-congress-must-approve-law-national-search-commission-disappear">commented</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The Historical Clarification Commission&#8217;s report was a massive landmark for human rights in Guatemala. Now it is time for the government to deliver some justice.</blockquote>Also included in the report were recommendations to make amends to the survivors and victim&#39;s families. <br /><br />Earlier this month, the director of Guatemala&#39;s National Compensation Program (PNR) announced that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/guatemala-files-criminal-complaints-for.php">the government has filed</a> [JURIST report] more than 3,000 criminal complaints for human rights violations committed during the internal armed conflict on behalf of 5000 victims.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] British Justice Secretary <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/straw.htm">Jack Straw</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement240209a.htm">vetoed</a> [materials] a British <a href="http://www.informationtribunal.gov.uk/">Information Tribunal</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/britain-tribunal-orders-release-of.php">order</a> [JURIST report] for the release of redacted minutes of two <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Cabinet</a> [official website] discussions from the months prior to the invasion of <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=iraq">Iraq</a> [JURIST news archive]. Straw <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/foi-statement-reasons.pdf">declared</a> [statement of reasons, PDF] that the public interest in keeping Cabinet meetings secret outweighed the benefits of disclosure: <blockquote>Serious and controversial decisions must be taken with free, frank &#8211; even blunt &#8211; deliberation between colleagues.  Dialogue must be fearless. Ministers must have the confidence to challenge each other in private. They must ensure that decisions have been properly thought through, sounding out all possibilities before committing themselves to a course of action. They must not feel inhibited from advancing opinions that may be unpopular or controversial. They must not be deflected from expressing dissent by the fear that they may be held personally to account for views that are later cast aside. Discussions of this nature will not however take place without a private space in which thoughts can be voiced without fear of reprisal, or publicity.</blockquote>Straw mentioned several other justifications for the veto, citing substantial policy discussions of an &quot;exceptionally serious&quot; issue which &quot;attracted exceptional media coverage.&quot; <a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2491548.0.Cries_of_shame_as_Straw_vetoes_release_of_Iraq_invasion_papers.php">Critics</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span> report] noted a potential conflict of interest, as Straw supported the invasion and was serving as Foreign Secretary at the time of the meetings. <br /><br />The veto is the first of its kind under Britain&#39;s <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000036_en_1">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text], which <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/british-freedom-of-information-act.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in January 2005, four years after its passage by Parliament. At the time, critics complained about broad exceptions that might prevent the release of highly sought-after documents, including many relating to the war in Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Department of Defense Monday officially released its anticipated  <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pdfs/REVIEW_OF_DEPARTMENT_COMPLIANCE_WITH_PRESIDENTS_EXECUTIVE_ORDER_ON_DETAINEE_CONDITIONS_OF_CONFINEMENTa.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/guantanamo-meets-geneva-convention.php">report</a>] on detainee treatment at Guantanamo Bay in compliance with President Barack Obama&#39;s January 22 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Review_of_Detention_Policy_Options/">executive order</a> [text] mandating the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-begins-review-of.php">review</a> [JURIST report]. As expected, the report concluded that conditions at the prison &quot;are in conformity with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.&quot; The report made  several recommendations to improve conditions, however, including increasing detainee-to-detainee contact, better training for guards, easier detainee access to health care services and video recording of interrogations. Introducing the report at a Pentagon <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4359">press conference </a> [transcript], review head and Vice Chief of Naval Operations <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=295">Admiral Patrick Walsh</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-navy-admiral-to-review-guantanamo.php">report</a>], was careful to distinguish between possible past violations of the Geneva Conventions and the current situation at the facility: &quot;In each case where there were violations the command took appropriate action, and there was discipline and accountability and that is what we are looking for here&quot;. <br /><br />Walsh&#39;s report was immediately attacked by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] which released its own <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/learn-more/reports/current-conditions-confinement-guantanamo">report</a> [text] detailing alleged violations at Guantanamo Bay and calling for an end to abusive practices.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/about/biographiescurrent.pdf">Justice Antonin Scalia</a> [official profile, PDF] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-410.pdf">dissented</a> [text, PDF] from the Court&#39;s denial of <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> to a Chicago federal corruption case. Three former aides to Chicago Mayor <a href="http://egov.cityofchicago.org:80/city/webportal/portalContentItemAction.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@0728979215.1235484705@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccccadegihkkijmcefecelldffhdfif.0&contentOID=536883237&contenTypeName=COC_EDITORIAL&topChannelName=Government&blockName=Promo+Item&channelId=-536879036&programId=536880056">Richard Daley</a> [official profile] appealed their convictions on charges of mail fraud related to granting city jobs to political supporters. Appellants Robert Sorich, Timothy McCarthy, and Patrick Slattery <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-daley-aides24feb24,0,5501652.story">asserted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> report] that because they received no bribes or rewards for their actions, no federal offense was committed under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1346.html">federal law</a> [18 U.S.C. 1346, text] prohibiting employees from depriving citizens of &quot;intangible services.&quot; Scalia commented on the loose wording of the federal corruption law, last updated in 1987, stating: <blockquote>If the &#39;honest services&#39; theory&#8212;broadly stated, that officeholders and employees owe a duty to act only in the best interests of their constituents and employers&#8212;is taken seriously and carried to its logical conclusion, presumably the statute also renders criminal a state legislator&#8217;s decision to vote for a bill because he expects it will curry favor with a small minority essential to his reelection; a mayor&#8217;s attempt to use the prestige of his office to obtain a restaurant table without a reservation; a public employee&#8217;s recommendation of his incompetent friend for a public contract; and any self-dealing by a corporate officer. Indeed, it would seemingly cover a salaried employee&#8217;s phoning in sick to go to a ball game.</blockquote>Scalia was the only one to dissent, and the rest of the Court did not comment on why <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span> was not granted.<br /><br />Last month the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] then-governor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blagojevich">Rod Blagojevich</a> [JURIST news archive] from office for allegedly trying to sell the US Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama. Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">were arrested </a> [JURIST report] in December on the same charges. Last year, former Illinois Governor <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=george+ryan">George Ryan</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/former-illinois-governor-heads-to.php">began serving a six-and-a-half-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted of corruption and fraud in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Judge <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1261">Samuel Kent</a> [official profile] pleaded guilty on Monday to obstruction of justice charges in connection with the alleged sexual harassment of his secretary and former case manager. The plea agreement included an admission that the sexual conduct was not consensual, in exchange for dropping five other counts of inappropriate sexual conduct with employees. The prosecution also agreed to limit Kent&#39;s prison sentence to three years, even though obstruction of justice is punishable by a sentence of up to 20 years. The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-crm-153.html">statement</a> [press release] describing the agreement in detail: <blockquote>As part of his plea, Kent admitted that in both 2003 and 2007, he engaged in non-consensual sexual contact with Person A. He also admitted that he engaged in non-consensual contact with Person B from 2004 through at least 2005. According to court documents, when Person A filed a misconduct complaint against Kent, the Fifth Circuit appointed a committee to investigate whether Kent had engaged in unwanted sexual contact with Person A or any other individuals. Kent admitted that when he appeared before the committee in June 2007, he falsely testified about his conduct with Person B.</blockquote>Kent immediately retired following the guilty plea, but might still face impeachment from Congress because federal judges continue to receive their salaries after retirement.<br /><br />Kent&#39;s plea prevents him from becoming the first federal judge to go on trial for sexual harassment. He was <a href="http://images.chron.com/content/news/pdfs/08/08/28/kentcourt.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] last August, and was initially charged with the sexual harassment of his former case manager. Charges related to the alleged sexual abuse of his secretary <a href="http://abajournal.com/news/federal_judge_samuel_kent_indicted_on_new_sex_and_obstruction_charges/">were added</a> [<em>ABA Journal</em> report, text] last month. In 2007, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [professional association] adopted new policies <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/aba-adopts-new-judicial-conduct.php">reforming the Model Code of Judicial Conduct</a> [JURIST report], which for the first time included prohibitions against sexual harassment, although some advocacy groups believe these changes <a href="http://www3.whdh.com/news/articles/national/BO42963/">do not go far enough</a> [AP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] urged sweeping reform of the American financial regulatory system in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-President-Barack-Obama-Address-to-Joint-Session-of-Congress/">speech</a> [text] on his economic revitalization plan to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. His address, which came less than a week after he <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-signs-recovery-bill-into-law-with.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the $787 billion <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ARRA_public_review/">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> (ARRA) [materials], focused on job creation, tax cuts, and funding for education and public works. Obama asked Congress:<blockquote>...to join me in doing whatever proves necessary.  Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession, and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system.  It is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse. </blockquote>Obama also outlined an aggressive plan to restart consumer lending and free up the troubled credit markets, and outlined the creation of a special fund to make more consumer, auto, and student loans available to the public. <br /><br />The ARRA, intended to stimulate and grow the US economy, came under Congressional scrutiny in the US Senate earlier this month with the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/senate-amends-buy-american-stimulus.php">amendment of its &quot;Buy American&quot; clause</a> [JURIST report] requiring that all goods used in construction projects, particularly iron and steel, must be manufactured in the US in order to receive stimulus funding. The provision was revised to clarify that the law will be applied consistently with US obligations under international trade agreements. Many countries, including Canada, were <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUKN0551421420090205">pleased</a> [Reuters report] with the Senate&#39;s move to define the provision, but international industry groups like the European steel confederation <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/">Eurofer</a> [official website] believe they <a href="http://www.eurofer.org/index.php/eng/News-Publications/Press-Releases/EUROFER-warns-US-Senate-s-amendment-on-Buy-American-Bill-does-little-to-remove-the-negative-effects-on-EU-industry">did not go far enough</a> [press release] to resolve <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-hints-at-legal-action-if-us-stimulus.php">global concerns</a> [JURIST report] about protectionism. Obama has already distanced himself from the &quot;Buy American&quot; provision, saying in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/President44/Story?id=6795877&page=3">interview</a> [transcript] earlier this month, &quot;That is a potential source of trade wars that we can&#39;t afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Attorney General <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Eric Holder</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Holder">news archive</a>] Wednesday confirmed the Obama administration&#39;s intention to close <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2010 despite his belief that the facility is now well-run and that detainees are treated appropriately by guards. After <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-ag-holder-visits-guantanamo-as-part.php">visiting the prison</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, Holder told reporters that he was impressed with what he saw there. His comments stand in direct contrast to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE51O3TB20090225">statements</a> [Reuters report] made earlier this week by <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] human rights lawyer Ahmed Ghappour, who said that complaints of beatings and other abuses have increased substantially since December as guards supposedly anticipated closure and stricter restraints imposed by the new administration. Reprieve currently represents 31 Guantanamo detainees. <br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/x6TGbQ6siSY&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/x6TGbQ6siSY&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Holder&#39;s visit to Guantanamo Bay was part of the Justice Department&#39;s effort to carry out US President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">January 22 executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] freezing the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">news archive</a>] system, calling for the review of US judicial policy towards the detainees, and directing the closure of Guantanamo within one year. Earlier this week US Navy <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=295">Admiral Patrick Walsh</a> [official profile] presented a report pursuant to the same order <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/guantanamo-meets-geneva-convention.php">concluding that the prison now meets the requirements of the Geneva Conventions</a> [JURIST report], although it may not have done so in the past.

		<title>Germany ban on religious clothing violates human rights: HRW</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a new <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/germany0209_web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; report <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/02/25/discrimination-name-neutrality-0">materials</a>] on Thursday stating that Germany&#39;s bans on religious clothing and symbols, particularly those focused on the <a href="/currentawareness/religiousdress.php">headscarves</a> [JURIST news archive] worn by Muslim women, are discriminatory and violate international human rights standards. The report details the impact that the ban has on autonomy and the rights to privacy, self-expression, and religion. HRW argues that the bans violate international obligations and addresses the direct effects they have on the lives of Muslim women who wear headscarves:<blockquote>After examining the laws and policies in the eight German states that restrict the wearing of religious symbols, and how they are applied in practice, Human Rights Watch has found that they contravene Germany&#39;s international obligations to guarantee individuals the right to freedom of religion and equality before the law. These laws (either explicitly or in their application) discriminate against Muslim women, excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith.  <br /><br />These regulations are not abstract concerns. The restrictions have a profound effect on women&#39;s lives, as was described by women affected who spoke to Human Rights Watch. In those states with bans in effect, women wearing the headscarf are not permitted to work as teachers. Immediately after the new laws came into effect, teachers were asked to remove the headscarf and were reprimanded if they refused to do so, and in some cases even dismissed. Teachers, some with many years of employment, have been threatened with disciplinary action if they continue to wear the headscarf, and have been subject to disciplinary action in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg.</blockquote>The recommendations of the report include a call for the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/ENGLISH/ISSUES/RELIGION/index.htm">United Nations special rapporteur on the freedom of religion or belief</a> [official website] to visit the country in order to assess the compatibility of the bans with international human rights laws and to issue an opinion for resolving conflicts.<br /><br />Headscarves have been the topic of fierce debate in Germany since teacher <a href="http://www.pluralism.org/news/intl/index.php?xref=Fereshta+Ludin&sort=DESC">Fereshta Ludin</a> [Pluralism Project backgrounder] filed suit after being denied a job in Stuttgart in 1998. Ludin argued that the German constitution guaranteed her right to wear the headscarf. The federal <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] ruled in September 2003 that under then-current laws, she was correct, but it also noted that individual states could pass laws banning the headwear. Currently headscarves are prohibited in nine of the 16 German states, including in <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/germany-state-court-upholds-teacher.php">Hesse</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/germany-court-affirms-teacher-headscarf.php">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bavarian-headscarf-ban-upheld-in.php">Bavaria</a> [JURIST reports]. Baden-Wuerttemberg initially <a href="/paperchase/2004/04/headscarf-ban-approved-by-german-state.htm">banned headscarves from schools in 2004</a> [JURIST report], becoming the first state in Germany to do so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate on Thursday voted <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00071">87-11</a> [roll call] to approve an <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2009_record&page=S2490&position=all">amendment</a> [S.Amdt. 573 text, PDF] that would prevent the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] from reinstating the <a href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/fairnessdoct/fairnessdoct.htm">Fairness Doctrine</a> [MBC backgrounder]. Under the doctrine, which was struck down by the FCC in 1987, broadcast licenses could be revoked if the broadcaster failed to give airtime to opposing sides of controversial issues.  The proposal was introduced by conservative lawmakers seeking to preempt the Obama administration from attempting to resurrect the policy, but earlier this month a White House spokesman told Fox News that <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/18/white-house-opposes-fairness-doctrine/?loc=interstitialskip">Obama opposes the Fairness Doctrine</a> [report]. The Senate proposal forbids the FCC from prescribing any rules or standards requiring &quot;that broadcasters present or ascertain opposing viewpoints on issues of public importance.&quot; The amendment was added to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00160:">District of Columbia House Voting Act</a> [S. 160 materials; <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:s160rs.txt.pdf">text</a>, PDF], which seeks to provide full voting rights to the District of Columbia in the House of Representatives. The legislation now moves to the House for consideration.    <br /><br />In July 2007, then-FCC Chairman Kevin Martin <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/fcc-will-not-reinstate-fairness.php">assured the public that the FCC would not reinstate</a> [JURIST report] the Fairness Doctrine. Martin&#39;s comments followed a push from Democratic lawmakers for Congress to consider reinstating the doctrine, after conservative radio talk shows widely attacked immigration reform bills on air. Republican members of Congress responded by introducing the ultimately-unsuccessful <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.2905:">Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007</a> [HR 2905 text], which would have prevented reinstatement of the doctrine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/sketch08index.html">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profile]&nbsp;<a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200902/022509b.html">announced</a>&nbsp;[materials]&nbsp;on Wednesday that the Committee is set to begin hearings on the creation of a truth commission charged with investigating the national security policies of the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] administration. Speaking on the Senate floor, Leahy called the hearing &#8220;Getting to the Truth Through a Nonpartisan Commission of Inquiry,&#8221;&nbsp;and said that the panel&#39;s&nbsp;primary focus would be on <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+torture">harsh interrogation tactics</a>, <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST reports] and the Bush administration&#39;s broad use of executive authority. Leahy said the purpose of the&nbsp;commission was to not to cast blame for the policies, but to learn from previous mistakes and to regain US authority on human rights:<blockquote>Nothing has done more to damage America&#8217;s standing and moral authority than the revelations that, during the last eight years, we abandoned our historic commitment to human rights by repeatedly stretching the law and the bounds of executive power to authorize torture and cruel treatment.  As President Obama said to Congress and to the American people [on Tuesday] &quot;if we&#8217;re honest with ourselves, we&#8217;ll admit that for too long we have not always met&#8221; our responsibilities.  But what the President said about the economy also holds true here, &#8220;it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment&#8221; that we will be able to move forward.  How can we restore our moral leadership and ensure transparent government if we ignore what has happened?</blockquote>The hearings are scheduled to begin on March 4.<br /><br />Leahy first&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/senate-judiciary-chair-leahy-calls-for.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the creation of such a commission earlier this month. Members of the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] have also <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/house-judiciary-committee-chair-urges.php">called for an investigation</a> into the actions of Bush administration officials, and Obama has said that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/house-judiciary-committee-chair-urges.php">would not rule out such an investigation</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] has <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">alleged</a> [report] that top Bush officials, including former Defense Secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=donald+rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], &#8220;bore major responsibility&#8221; for abuses committed by U.S. interrogators in military detention centers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/People/Ministers/SecretaryOfStateForDefence.htm">Secretary of State for Defence John Hutton</a> [official profile] gave a <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/HuttonSetsRecordStraightOnDetainees.htm">statement</a> [MOD press release] to the UK <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/server-side/images/parliament_logo.gif">House of Commons</a> [official website] Thursday providing details of participation with US forces in the rendition of terrorism suspects from Iraq to US detention in Afghanistan, possibly by way of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. Hutton&#39;s revelation comes after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7912668.stm">years of statements</a> [BBC report] by UK officials, including to the House of Commons, that there had been no participation in the CIA program. In his <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/06.htm#hddr_1">statement</a> [text], Hutton explained the circumstances of the transfer, saying:<blockquote>In Iraq, we have reviewed the record of detainee numbers listing all individuals held in UK detention facilities... During the final stages of the review of records of detentions, we found information about one case relating to a security operation conducted in February 2004. I am sure that hon. Members will recall that that period saw an increased level of insurgent activity as the transfer to Iraqi sovereignty drew closer. During the operation, two individuals were captured by UK forces in and around Baghdad. They were transferred to US detention, in accordance with normal practice, and subsequently moved to a US detention facility in Afghanistan.<br /><br />This information was brought to my attention on 1 December 2008, and I instructed officials to investigate the case thoroughly and quickly so that I could bring a full account to Parliament. Following consultations with US authorities, we confirmed that they transferred the two individuals from Iraq to Afghanistan in 2004 and they remain in custody there today.<br /><br />I regret that it is now clear that inaccurate information on this particular issue has been given to the House by my Department. However, I want to stress that that was based upon the information available to Ministers and those who were briefing them at that time. My predecessors as Secretaries of State for Defence have confirmed to me that they had no knowledge of these events. I have written to the hon. Members concerned correcting the record, and am placing a copy of these letters also in the Library of the House. Again, I want to apologise to the House for these errors.</blockquote><br />In September 2008, the <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php">All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> (APPG) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/parliamentary-panel-gives-legal-opinion.php">legal opinion examining UK governmental liability</a> [JURIST report] for participation in the US rendition program. The APPG was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/parliamentary-group-challenging.php">convened in December 2005</a> [JURIST report] to call for a formal inquiry into whether the British government violated international law by aiding  CIA rendition flights. In July, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee called &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-commons-committee-deplores-false-us.php">deplorable</a>&quot; [JURIST report] what it termed &quot;false US assurances&quot; about extraordinary rendition flights through the UK Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. In July 2007, the UK Intelligence and Security Committee said it had <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/no-evidence-of-direct-uk-involvement-in.php">found no evidence</a> [JURIST report] of direct UK involvement in the operation of the extraordinary rendition flights through UK airspace, but said that the United States&#39; lack of regard for UK concerns in the war on terror had &quot;serious implications for the working of the relationship between the US and UK intelligence and security agencies.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia </a>[official website] on Thursday sentenced former CIA executive director <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=foggo">Kyle Foggo</a> [JURIST news archive] to 37 months in prison for wire fraud related to charges that he accepted bribes in return for granting federal defense contracts. Foggo was originally <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/indictment_foggo_wilkes.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/ex-cia-top-official-indicted-with.php">report</a>] in February 2007 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering in connection with allegations that his friend and defense contractor <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/52283">Brent Wilkes</a> [Newsweek profile] gave him gifts and promised him a job in return for the granting of CIA defense contracts. Prosecutors later <a href="http://www.expose-the-war-profiteers.org/archive/legal/2008-1/20080520.pdf">amended the indictment</a> [PDF text] to include counts of conflict of interest and additional counts of fraud, but Foggo <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/ex-cia-official-pleads-guilty-to-wire.php">negotiated a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] last September, limiting the trial to one count of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001343----000-.html">wire fraud</a> [18 USC s. 1343 text]. US District Judge James Cacheris issued the maximum sentence recommended by prosecutors, rejecting the defense team&#39;s request for probation. <br /><br />In November 2007, Wilkes was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/defense-contractor-convicted-of-all.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 13 felonies, including money laundering, fraud, and conspiracy, in connection with bribes he paid to former congressman <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000994">Randy Cunningham</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=randy+cunningham">news archive</a>]. Both Wilkes and Foggo came under investigation when <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/california-congressman-pleads-guilty.php">Cunningham pleaded guilty in 2005</a> [JURIST report] to taking $2.4 million in bribes in return for federal contracts. Foggo was the third highest-ranking CIA officer at the time of the misconduct.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/HOME/tabid/53/Default.aspx">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) [official website] on Wednesday found three former guerrilla leaders <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=K2RdSI3L9KM%3d&tabid=214">guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [press release] for their roles in the country&#39;s civil war. Issa Hassan Sesay, Morris Kallon, and Augustine Gbao are the three highest-ranking surviving <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ruf.htm">Revolutionary United Front</a> (RUF) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leaders, after founder Foday Sankoy died before being tried in 2003. Of 18 charges, Sesay and Kallon were found guilty of 16 offenses and Gbao was found guilty of 14 offenses. The SCSL was unable to convict any of the three men of murder or taking hostages, and Gbao was also found not guilty of conscripting child soldiers or murdering peacekeepers because his alleged actions were not sufficiently widespread and systematic to rise to the level of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The SCSL also held that they were not responsible for the January 1999 attack on Freetown which resulted in over 5,000 deaths. The three are expected to be sentenced within in one month. The SCSL <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Jc1wg3PdWIo%3d&tabid=214">announced</a> [press release] last week that this ruling would be its last.   <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unamsil/background.html">Sierra Leone civil war</a> [UNAMSIL backgrounder] ended in 2002 after eleven years, during which the RUF allegedly killed and mutilated civilians, forcibly recruited child soldiers, and forced many from their homes as villages were burned and destroyed. In 2002, the UN and Sierra Leone <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=CLk1rMQtCHg%3d&tabid=200">jointly established</a> [text, PDF] the Special Court to try the leaders believed to be responsible. In <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">October 2007</a> [JURIST report], the SCSL sentenced two former leaders of the Civil Defense Forces to serve six to eight years for &quot;murder, cruel treatment, pillage, and collective punishment.&quot; In <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">July 2007</a> [JURIST report], three former leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council were sentenced to 45 years imprisonment on counts of rape, murder, mutilation, pillage, and abducting children to force them to work as soldiers and diamond laborers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US citizen and al Qaeda member Christopher Paul was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-nsd-171.html">sentenced</a> [DOJ press release] to 20 years in prison Thursday for conspiring to conduct a terrorist bombing campaign against targets in the US and Europe. Paul was sentenced by <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/judges/jfrost.htm">Judge Gregory Frost</a> [official profile] of the US <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website]. Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Paul <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/June/08-nsd-492.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] to one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction in June 2008, agreeing to a sentence of 20 years. In the statement, Acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/nsd/bio.htm">Matthew Olsen</a> [official profile] said:<blockquote>Today&#8217;s sentence brings an end to the long, militant career of Christopher Paul, an Ohio native who joined al Qaeda in the early 1990s, fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia and conspired with others to target Americans both at home and abroad. His lengthy prison term demonstrates our continuing resolve to protect the American public against terrorism.</blockquote>Paul was <a href="/pdf/paulindictment.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/federal-grand-jury-indicts-ohio-man-on.php">report</a>] in April 2007 with conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists, conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction, and providing material support and resources to terrorists. <br /><br />Paul is allegedly connected to two other men from Columbus who have also been indicted on terrorism charges. <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/iyman_faris.htm">Iyman Faris</a> [Global Security profile], who was sentenced to 20 years in prison after <a href="/paperchase/2003/10/terror-suspect-sentenced-to-20-years.htm">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2003 to charges of conspiring to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge, attended the same mosque and became friends with Paul. Nuradin Abdi, a Somali national who was sentenced to 10 years in prison after <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/somali-man-pleads-guilty-to-plotting.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST report] to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, used Paul as a reference on a government employment application. According to investigators, Paul traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the early 1990s to receive military training at an al Qaeda training camp and, upon his return to the US, continued to funnel money and other resources to al Qaeda. The indictment also alleges that Paul provided explosives training to co-conspirators in Germany to carry out future attacks on European and United States targets.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Serbian President <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/milan_milutinovic_519.html">Milan Milutinovic</a> [TrialWatch profile; ICTY case <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/milutinovic/cis-milutinovical.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF] on Thursday was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milutinovic/tjug/en/090226summary.pdf">acquitted</a> [judgment summary, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10066">press release</a>] of all <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/milutinovic/4">charges</a> [case materials] of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=icty">news archive</a>]. Also Thursday, five other former high-ranking Yugoslav officials were convicted for crimes against humanity by the ICTY. Of the five, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1931999.stm">Nikola Sainovic</a> [BBC profile], Yugoslav Army General Nebojsa Pavkovic and Serbian Police General Sreten Lukic were each sentenced to 22 years in prison, and former Yugoslav Army General Vladimir Lazarevic and Chief of General Staff <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1932011.stm">Dragoljub Ojdanic</a> [BBC profile] were each sentenced to 15 years in prison. The charges stemmed from crimes allegedly committed during the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/rpt_990604_ksvo_ethnic.html">1999 ethnic conflicts</a> [State Department backgrounder] in <a href="/countries/kosovo.php">Kosovo</a> [JURIST news archive], which included the deportation of 800,000 Kosovar Albanian civilians and the forcible transfer, murder and persecution of Kosovar Albanians at the hands of Serbian troops. The ICTY held that Milutinovic had not substantially contributed to the criminal enterprise and that he did not have actual control over these forces. <br /><br />Milutinovic took over as president of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Serbia">Serbia</a> [JURIST news archive] in 1997 after <a href="/hottopics/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] ended his presidency, but Milutinovic reportedly continued to stay in close contact with Milosevic and carry out his policies. The Milutinovic trial was one of the largest and most complex in the ICTY&#39;s history as it included testimony from over 235 witnesses and included over 4,300 exhibits. The ICTY has indicted nine of the most senior Serb and Yugoslav officials for the crimes committed during the Kosovo conflict. In total the Tribunal has indicted 161 people for human rights violations allegedly committed in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001, and 116 of the proceedings have been completed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in Lebanon on Wednesday granted bail to three men suspected of involvement in the February 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST news <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4264359.stm">archive</a>].

Of the three men, who have been detained for three years, Mahmoud and Ahmed Abdel-Aal are Lebanese brothers whose phone records allegedly link them to the bombings, and are members of a pro-Syrian Sunni Muslim group. Ibrahim Jarjoura is a Syrian who was arrested for allegedly misleading the investigation. Four more suspects, who are high ranking Lebanese generals, are still being held. The SLT is expected to <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=99597">request their transfer</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Lebanon Daily Star</span> report] to The Hague within two months.<br /><br />Created by <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9029.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 1757</a> [text] in May 2007, the SLT <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-hariri-tribunal-to-begin-work-march.php">will commence</a> [JURIST report] operations in The Hague on March 1, but has not yet issued any indictments. Investigation of Hariri&#39;s assassination have increased tensions between Lebanon and Syria, because the UN International Independent Investigation Commission&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/docs/mehlisreport/">report</a> [text] implicated <a href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2009/02/mehlis_is_sure.php">Syrian officials</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">YaLibnan</span> report] in the killing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_02-25-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb09.shtml">briefs</a>] in two cases on Wednesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-108.pdf">Flores-Figueroa v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether a federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001028----000-.html">&quot;aggravated identity theft&quot; statute</a> [18 U.S.C. &sect; 1028A(a)(1)] applies only to individuals who knowingly use another person&#39;s identification documents. In April, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/04/072871U.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] Ignacio Flores-Figueroa&#39;s conviction for using counterfeit social security and resident alien cards. Flores renewed his argument before the Court on Wednesday, asserting that the statute is aimed at identity theft and not immigration issues:<blockquote>In common usage to say that somebody knowingly transfers, possesses or uses something is to say that that person knows what it is that he is transferring, possessing or using....The same principle follows under the Federal aggravated identity theft statute, which calls for a two-year mandatory sentence...</blockquote>The government countered that the prosecution need only show that the identification belonged to a real person, and that the defendant knowingly used the document:<blockquote>I agree that a person who deliberately sets out to misappropriate the identity of a known individual is almost certainly more culpable than someone who does not do it but inadvertently does so.<br />But I don&#39;t think that is controlling in this case for a very important reason....[W]e are not having this conversation unless the defendant has already committed the predicate felony, and he is subject to punishment for that predicate felony.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1372.pdf">Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether the state of Hawaii is precluded from transferring 1.2 million acres of land ceded by the former Hawaiian monarchy, pending a political settlement with <a href="http://www.nativehawaiians.com/">Native Hawaiians</a> [advocacy website]. The <a href="http://www.oha.org/">Office of Hawaiian Affairs</a>(OHA) [official website] had won an injunction from the <a href="http://www.courts.state.hi.us/page_server/Courts/Supreme/72D2460755E8199BEBD3ACE8C3.html">Hawaii Supreme Court</a> [official website] barring the state from selling any ceded lands until claims to the land are settled. The state of Hawaii argues that the <a href="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/publawall.html">1993 Apology Resolution</a> [text] passed by Congress was not intended to limit the state&#39;s ability to manage its land:<blockquote>A 1993 congressional apology resolution did not alter Hawaii&#39;s right to transfer its public lands or repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments that it extinguish all competing claims to those lands. It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple apology, and no more.</blockquote>OHA counters that the Hawaii Supreme Court properly acknowledged the State&#39;s fiduciary obligation under state law, and did not rely on the Apology Resolution:<blockquote>I think that if one looks at the critical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court&#39;s opinion on pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court actually discusses the relevance of the Apology Resolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on it only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians have unresolved claims.</blockquote>The Hawaiian monarchy was <a href="http://hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&CategoryID=259">overthrown</a> [historical timeline] in 1893, and the US annexed its territory five years later.  Hawaii was admitted as a state in 1959.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Colombian <a href="http://web.presidencia.gov.co/presidente/">President Alvaro Uribe</a> [official profile, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3214685.stm">profile</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://web.presidencia.gov.co/english/2009/febrero/01262009_eng.html<br />&quot;&gt;announced</a> [press release] that the <a href="http://www.das.gov.co/">Department of Administrative Security</a> (DAS) [official website, in Spanish] will no longer be able to conduct wiretapping operations with just a court order, and will now require the cooperation of the <a href="http://oasportal.policia.gov.co/portal/page/portal/HOME/Home">National Police</a> [official website, in Spanish].  This order follows allegations that the DAS illegally recorded the conversations of Supreme Court magistrates, media directors, and politicians from the opposition.  According to Uribe, the police will need to verify the legality of the requests and will act as a check on the power of national intelligence gathering, improving transparency.  DAS Director Felipe Munoz has <a href="http://www.colombiareports.com/colombian-news/news/3044-intelligence-director-das-resigns.html">acknowledged the existence</a> [<em>Colombia Reports</em> report] of evidence supporting the allegations.  Intelligence Director Fernando Tabares resigned Thursday, the fourth intelligence official to resign in the midst of the scandal.<br /><br />On Monday, Uribe <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/colombia-president-denies-ordering.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] ordering any of the illegal wiretaps.  Last year, Uribe and his administration were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/colombia-minister-admits-illegal.php">cleared of similar allegations</a> [JURIST report] after claiming they were unaware of a plan to record journalists, opposition members, and government officials.  The scandal comes at an inopportune time for Colombian officials, as Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos and Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-santos-qa9-2009jan09,0,7214767.story">trying to convince</a> [LA Times interview] the Obama administration to <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N21537960.htm">continue funding an anti-drug initiative</a> [Reuters report] despite human rights violations, corruption and a failure to reduce cocaine production.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Robert Cleland of the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday ordered journalist David Ashenfelter to attend a second deposition to answer questions regarding unnamed sources he used in connection with a 2004 article on former federal prosecutor Richard Convertino. Cleland declined to hold Ashenfelter in contempt, however, instead requiring the <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.freep.com/">Detroit Free Press</a></span> [media website] journalist to either divulge his governmental sources or support his Fifth Amendment claim with further facts. Ashenfelter has exerted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to reveal sources within the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice </a>(DOJ) [official website] who supplied Ashenfelter with information regarding Convertino&#39;s conduct during the 2001 trial of terror suspect Karim Koubriti. Convertino <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/federal-prosecutor-sues-ashcroft-says.htm">sued the DOJ</a> [JURIST report] in 2004 for leaking information about his conduct during the trial. Cleland wrote: <blockquote>As discussed, Ashenfelter, as the witness seeking protection under the Fifth amendment, has not yet provided personal testimony or other evidence which sufficiently indicates the nature of any criminal liability he may fear. The court has been presented with an abstract list of possible crimes which, without specific factual backing, provide little more than Ashenfelter&#39;s &quot;say so&quot; that a reasonable possibility of criminal prosecution exists. In light of the reasoning expressed herein however, the court will provide Ashenfelter a further opportunity to either provide the requested information or to properly develop the factual record so that this court may weigh his claim under the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>Judge Cleland additionally imposed a deadline of March 6, 2009 for Ashenfelter&#39;s next deposition.<br /><br />The Ashenfelter dispute is the latest in a series of cases involving journalists who have refused to divulge their sources. In November, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-appeals-court-vacates-locy.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a contempt order against former <span style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span> reporter Toni Locy. Locy had refused to reveal government sources for a series of articles she wrote about the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anthrax">2001 anthrax attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], and had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-holds-anthrax-reporter-in.php">held in contempt</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008 by Judge Reggie Walton of the US District Court for the District of Columbia. In October 2005, Judge Thomas Hogan of the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/judge-lifts-contempt-order-for-nyt.php">lifted the contempt order</a> [JURIST report] against former <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> journalist Judith Miller, who had refused to reveal sources she used for a report on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+leak">2003 leak</a> [JURIST news archive] of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China&#39;s <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">Information Office of the State Council</a> [official website, in Mandarin] issued its now-annual <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/13/content_7779839.htm">report</a> [text] on violations of human rights in and by the United States Thursday a day after the US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119037.htm">scolded China</a> [report text] for a variety of human rights abuses in its <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">annual series of country reports on human rights around the world</a> [JURIST report]. Among other things, the Chinese report noted:<BLOCKQUOTE>The United States of America is [sic] the world&#39;s largest prison and has the highest inmates/population ratio in the world. A December 5, 2007 report by EFE news agency quoted statistics of U.S. Department of Justice as saying that the number of inmates in U.S. prisons has increased by 500 percent over the last 30 years. By the end of 2006, there were 2.26 million inmates in U.S. prisons, up 2.8 percent from a year ago. The number is the highest over the last six years. The U.S. population only accounted for 5 percent of the world total, but its inmates made up 25 percent of the world total. There were 751 inmates in every 100,000 U.S. citizens, far higher than the rates in other Western countries (EFE news agency, December 5, 2007). Among the inmates, 96 percent were serving sentences of more than one year, which equaled about one in every 200 U.S. citizens serving a sentence of more than a year (Prisoners In 2006, U.S. Department of Justice, www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs). Since the September 11 attacks, reincarceration rate has been rising in the United States. According to statistics, about two thirds of the inmates would commit a second crime within three years after releasing. Two out of three inmates would be caught again after their release and 40 percent would be put behind bars again.</BLOCKQUOTE>On Wednesday, Chinese state news agency <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/">Xinhua</a> [media website] <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/26/content_10899729.htm">accused the US</a> [Xinhua report] of &quot;turning a blind eye to to the efforts and historic achievements China has made in human rights&quot; and of distorting facts and making &quot;irresponsible remarks on China&#39;s ethnic, religious and legal systems.&quot; The two countries have recently made a regular practice of trading rights accusations at the time of the State Department report release, with Chinese sensitivity growing in the run-up to and follow-up from the 2010 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=beijing+olympics">Beijing Olympics</a> [JURIST report].

In a Wednesday hearing, Napolitano told lawmakers that she was not made aware of the raid which resulted in the arrest of 28 foreign nationals, adding:  <br /><blockquote>In my view, we have to do workplace enforcement [and] it needs to be focused on employers who intentionally and knowingly exploit the illegal labor market. That [behavior] has impacts on American workers, it has an impact on wage levels, [and it] often has undue impact on the illegal workers themselves. Our ICE efforts should be focused on those sorts of things.</blockquote>Napolitano issued a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1233353528835.shtm">directive</a> [text] in January calling for the review and assessment of ICE fugitive operation teams in response to a number of workplace raids similar to Tuesday&#39;s.<br /><br />Earlier this month, ICE tactics under the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/bush-immigration-enforcement-policies.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] for being overly-aggressive and ineffective.  ICE has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/hundreds-of-suspected-illegal-aliens.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] many non-criminal illegal immigrants in the past year, many of whom were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST report]. In April, Seton Hall Law School&#39;s Center for Social Justice filed a <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/04/lawsuit_claims_immigration_rai.html">lawsuit</a> [Star-Ledger report] claiming that warrantless immigration raids violate the US Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href=http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/>US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/084358.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that two former lobbyists may use classified documents in their <a href=http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/aipac/>defense against charges</a> [case materials] under the <a href=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000793----000-.html>1917 Espionage Act</a> [18 USC 793 text]. Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman, previously with the <a href=http://www.aipac.org/>American Israel Public Affairs Committee</a> (AIPAC) [advocacy website], are charged with <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/former-pro-israel-lobbyists-indicted.php>conspiring to convey classified US intelligence to the Israeli government</a> [JURIST report]. Tuesday&#39;s decision affirmed a ruling of the <a href=http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/>US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] that the defendant&#39;s would be allowed to use certain classified materials in their defense under the <a href=http://fas.org/irp/offdocs/laws/pl096456.htm>Classified Information Procedures Act</a> (CIPA) [text].<br /><br />The district court ruled in 2006 that the prosecution must show the defendants <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/24/AR2009022403855.html>&quot;had bad faith purposes&quot;</a> [AP report], as well as knowledge that their actions would harm the United States. Rosen and Weissman had earlier <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/08/federal-judge-rules-espionage-act.php>challenged the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of the Espionage Act, which has been construed ever more narrowly since it was first passed during World War I.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi-born Dutch citizen Wesam al Delaema <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-nsd-168.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] Thursday in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to a charge of <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=$$xa$$busc18.wais&start=3695121&SIZE=4866&TYPE=TEXT">conspiracy to murder US nationals outside the United States</a> [text].  Al Delaema is the first alleged insurgent in the Iraq war to be tried in US federal court.  As part of the plea arrangement al Deleama admitted planting roadside bombs in the Iraq city of Fallujah and demonstrating on video how he planned to detonate those bombs to kill Americans.  The agreement calls for a 25-year sentence to be served in the Netherlands, though the court will formally sentence al Delaema April 15.  The Netherlands, however, has discretion to change the length of the sentence.  <br /><br />In 2007 al Delaema <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/extradited-dutch-citizen-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to attacks on US troops in Fallujah in 2003.  The <a href="http://english.justitie.nl/">Dutch Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/dutch-citizen-extradited-to-us-for.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] al Delaema to the United States in 2007 after <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/dutch-citizen-to-be-extradited-to-us.php">authorization</a> [JURIST report] from a Dutch court based on US promises to try al Delaema in a federal court rather than by a <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive].  Al Delaema was held in the Netherlands for about two years after the US <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/us-charges-dutch-citizen-for-crimes-in.php">charged him with attempting to kill US soldiers</a> [JURIST report] in 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] on Wednesday released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials]. <a href="http://www.state.gov/video/?videoid=14120286001">Announcing the release</a> [Flash video; statement <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/02/119786.htm">text</a>], Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the new Barack Obama administration is seeking to both improve the US rights record at home and to continue to promote the recognition and protection of human rights around the world. In its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/frontmatter/118984.htm">introduction</a> [text] to the reports, which covered almost 200 countries, the Department noted that many countries still abuse basic human rights, that those abuses are generally emblematic of deep-routed problems within the political structures of those countries, and that more robust political systems lead to the better respect of human rights:<blockquote>Each country report speaks for itself. However, some broad, cross-cutting observations can be drawn.<br /><br />One: In 2008, pushback against demands for greater personal and political freedom continued in many countries across the globe. A disturbing number of countries imposed burdensome, restrictive, or repressive laws and regulations against NGOs and the media, including the Internet. Many courageous human rights defenders who peacefully pressed for their own rights and those of their fellow countrymen and women were harassed, threatened, arrested and imprisoned, killed, or were subjected to violent extrajudicial means of reprisal.<br /><br />Two: Human rights abuses remain a symptom of deeper dysfunctions within political systems. The most serious human rights abuses tended to occur in countries where unaccountable rulers wielded unchecked power or there was government failure or collapse, often exacerbated or caused by internal or external conflict.<br /><br />Three: Healthy political systems are far more likely to respect human rights. Countries in which human rights were most protected and respected were characterized by the following electoral, institutional, and societal elements:<br /><br />Free and fair electoral processes that include not only a clean casting and honest counting of ballots on election day, but also a run-up to the voting that allows for real competition and full respect for the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association;<br /><br />Representative, accountable, transparent, democratic institutions of government, including independent judiciaries, under the rule of law to ensure that leaders who win elections democratically also govern democratically, and are responsive to the will and needs of the people; and<br /><br />Vibrant civil societies, including independent NGOs and free media.</blockquote>In Africa, the DOS criticized continuing conflicts in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">Somalia</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sudan">Sudan</a>, and said that Zimbabwe&#39;s President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> continues to impose authoritarian rule over the country. It praised democratic elections in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=angola">Angola</a>, Ghana and Zambia; and progress made my the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ictr">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [JURIST news archives].<br /><br />In East Asia and the Pacific, the DOS criticized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china">China</a> for its repression of Tibetan and Uighur minorities, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vietnam">Vietnam</a> for increased restrictions on the press and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burma">Burma</a> for making sweeping constitutional changes in the aftermath of a devastating typhoon. It praised progress made by the Bilateral Commission of Truth and Friendship in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=indonesia">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eccc">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) as well as legislation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cambodia">Cambodia</a> [JURIST news archives] designed to fight human trafficking.<br /><br />In Europe and Eurasia, the DOS criticized both <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=georgia">Georgia</a> for their actions in South Ossetia, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Belarus">Belarus</a> for failing to protect journalists, and several countries for general hostility towards free press and non-governmental organizations.  It praised <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo">Kosovo</a> [JURIST news archives] for its democratically declared independence, but said that anti-hate-speech legislation in Britain, Germany, and other European countries could too severely limit free speech.<br /><br />In the Near East and North Africa, the DOS criticized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> for imprisoning human rights activists and Egypt, Iran, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saudi+arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> for restrictions on religious freedoms. It praised both Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for increased female participation in government, and Oman and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a> [JURIST news archives] for enacting legislation to improve labor conditions.<br /><br />In South and Central Asia, the DOS criticized Kyrgyzstan, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and Turkmenistan for restrictions on journalists; Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan for restrictions on religious freedoms; and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=india">India</a> for continued use of child labor. It praised Pakistan, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maldives">Maldives</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> [JURIST news archives] for holding democratic elections.<br /><br />In the Western Hemisphere, the DOS criticized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> for restriction on speech, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=venezuela">Venezuela</a> for press restrictions and called <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cuba">Cuba</a> &quot;the hemisphere&#39;s only totalitarian state.&quot; It praised <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=columbia">Columbia</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=peru">Peru</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chile">Chile</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=argentina">Argentina</a> [JURIST news archives] for conducting investigations into past human rights abuses.<br /><br />The DOS issues its yearly reports on human rights practices to Congress under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode22/usc_sec_22_00002151---n000-.html">legal mandate</a> [22 USC &sect; 2151n text], and has filed similar reports for <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">2007</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rice-says-us-allies-among-worst-human.php">2006</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/us-rights-reports-name-north-korea.php">2005</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/state-department-raps-middle-east.php">2004</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/us-human-rights-reports-cite-gains-in.htm">2003</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/state-department-human-rights-reports.php">2002</a> [JURIST reports] and previous years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decided two cases Wednesday. In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-665">Pleasant Grove City v. Summum</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder;  JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-first-amendment.php">report</a>] the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-665.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that privately donated monuments displayed in public parks qualify as government speech, and that their display is therefore not subject to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/search/display.html?terms=first%20amendment&url=/anncon/html/amdt1bfrag1_user.html">freedom of expression</a> [LII backgrounder] considerations that apply to private speech. The case involved Pleasant Grove&#39;s refusal to accept the donation of a monument displaying the Seven Aphorisms of the Summum religion, even though it had accepted a monument displaying the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. Reversing a <a href="http://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/opinions/06/06-4057.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the court held that the display of a permanent monument on government land was best construed as speech of the government itself, and subject only to the restrictions of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">Establishment Clause</a> [LII backgrounder], which prohibits the government from creating a state religion. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that Pleasant Grove need not endorse a particular meaning of text included on a monument in order for the placement of the monument itself to be considered government expression:<blockquote>Contrary to respondent&#8217;s apparent belief, it frequently is not possible to identify a single &#8220;message&#8221; that is conveyed by an object or structure, and consequently, the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and displays such an object may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor. By accepting a privately donated monument and placing it on city property, a city engages in expressive conduct, but the intended and perceived significance of that conduct may not coincide with the thinking of the monument&#8217;s donor or creator. Indeed, when a privately donated memorial is funded by many small donations, the donors themselves may differ in their interpretation of the monument&#8217;s significance. By accepting such a monument, a government entity does not necessarily endorse the specific meaning that any particular donor sees in the monument.</blockquote> Justices <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-665.ZC.html">John Paul Stevens</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-665.ZC1.html">Antonin Scalia</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-665.ZC2.html">Stephen Breyer</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-665.ZC3.html">David Souter</a> [concurrence texts] all filed concurring opinions.<br /><br />Also Wednesday, the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-512.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-512">Pacific Bell v. Linkline Communications</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder;  JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-veterans-benefits.php">report</a>] that telecommunication product retailers cannot pursue an antitrust claim against a telecommunication company that acts as both a retailer and wholesaler of the product when the defendant company is not under an obligation to sell the product to competing retailers. Linkline, a DSL retailer, had sued Pacific Bell, both a DSL retailer and wholesaler, for &quot;price squeezing,&quot; a practice where a company both raises the wholesale price at which it offers a product to competitors while lowering the price at which it sells the product at retail, under a <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sec_15_00000002----000-.html">federal law</a> [15 USC &sect; 2 text] prohibiting monopolies. Reversing a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/01869D985FA0790588257353005142B7/$file/0556023.pdf?openelement">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court rejected Linkline&#39;s claim, reasoning that a <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-150A1.pdf">change</a> [FCC order, PDF] in Federal Communications Commission regulations no longer required Pacific Bell to sell DSL lines to other retailers, and that there was no evidence that Pacific Bell had been participating in predatory retail pricing:<blockquote>Plaintiffs&#8217; price-squeeze claim, looking to the relation between retail and wholesale prices, is thus nothing more than an amalgamation of a meritless claim at the retail level and a meritless claim at the wholesale level.  If there is no duty to deal at the wholesale level and no predatory pricing at the retail level, then a firm is certainly not required to price both of these services in a manner that preserves its rivals&#8217; profit margins.</blockquote> Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion of the court. Justice Breyer wrote a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-512.ZC.html">concurrence</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Argentina <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.ar/index.asp">Ministry of Defense</a> (MOD) [official website, in Spanish] announced Friday the implementation of a new law containing  provisions aimed at bringing the military and its justice system under increased civilian control. The legislation was signed into law last August. The law is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jEIT0d3HkWaeSULNnYit9NMeWjjgD96K7CU00">seen by many</a> [AP report] as a response to the return of democracy and the rise of independent political institutions following widespread human rights violations during the country&#39;s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, known as the &quot;<a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">Dirty War</a>&quot; [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war+argentina">news archive</a>]. Included in the law are <a href="http://www.mindef.gov.ar/info.asp?Id=1749">provisions</a> [MOD press release, in Spanish] that eliminate the death penalty, move trials against service members for offenses to civilian courts, and amend the military legal disciplinary system.<br /><br />It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the military dictatorship&#39;s campaign against suspected dissidents. In 2005, Argentina&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">struck down amnesty laws</a> [JURIST report] adopted in the 1980s to protect potential defendants, prompting the government to reopen hundreds of human rights cases. In July, an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-life.php">sentenced former general Luciano Benjamin Menendez</a> and four others to life in prison for the 1977 kidnapping, torture, and killing of four political dissidents during the &quot;Dirty War,&quot; and in August, a court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/argentina-ex-generals-convicted-of.php">convicted Mendendez and another former general</a> [JURIST reports] and sentenced them to life terms for kidnapping, torturing, and murdering Peronist politician Guillermo Vargas Aignasse in 1976 during the coup that brought the military to power.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China&#39;s top legislative body, the <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2005-09/02/content_28456.htm">Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress</a> (SCNPC) [official backgrounder], approved a new food safety law Saturday which will setup a commission to supervise the country&#39;s food monitoring system, according to state media reports. The law <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-02/28/content_7522958.htm">passed</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report] by a vote of 158-7 and is to take effect June 1. It is intended to improve the monitoring system by implementing new national safety standards, recalling unsafe or inferior products, and provides strict punishment for those who violate the law. The law also includes <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-02/28/content_7522309.htm">provisions reducing the number of government agencies involved in food safety supervision</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report], as this was a major point of criticism of the current system.  <br /><br />The new law follows a series of food scandals in <a href="/countries/china.php">China</a> [JURIST news archive] over the last few years. News of milk powder contamination by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report], which lead to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders. The contaminated milk is believed to have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i7MiJ6RPCScq-j1ti0boCmc-CFjwD96KDCNG0">caused</a> [AP report] the deaths of at least six infants along with sickening about 300,000 others. In 2007 China came under fire after chemicals were found in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/02/us/02toothpaste.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">toothpaste</a> [NYT report], toys and seafood, and was generally blamed for <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/09/business/petfood.php">toxins found in pet food</a> [IHT report] that killed hundreds of dogs and cats in the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] gave notice to the White House Office of Management and Budget Friday that it was preparing to rescind a <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-30134.pdf">Bush administration regulation</a> [text] protecting healthcare workers who refuse to fulfill medical services that violate their moral principles. The regulation, which was entered into the Federal Register on December 19, 2008, came into effect on January 20, just before the change in administration, and expressly limited potential actions brought by recipients of federal funding. Supporters of the regulation include the <a href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a> [organization website] and the <a href="http://www.chausa.org/">Catholic Health Association</a> [organization website], which believe that it protects the consciences of some health practitioners. Opponents of the regulation include the<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association</a> [organization website] and <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [organization website], which believe it rewards those who deny women some types of medical services, including abortions. The official announcement of intent by the Obama administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/politics/28web-abort.html?_r=1&hp">is expected</a> [NYT report] next week. <br /><br />Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-repeals-international-abortion.php">repealed an international abortion funding restriction</a> [JURIST report] in January, which refused federal funding to all international family planning organizations that provided information or counseling about abortions. In December, 13 state attorney generals <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/group-of-state-attorneys-general.php">protested the provisions of a similar proposed rule</a> [JURIST report] that would limit women&#39;s access to abortion based on the religious beliefs of their medical providers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Speaking on behalf of the European Union, Czech Interior Minister <a href="http://www.langer.cz/">Ivan Langer</a> [official profile, in Czech] Thursday <a href="http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/press-releases/interior-ministers-discuss-guantanamo-at-justice-and-home-affairs-council--10765/">expressed reservations</a> [press release] about hosting <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees without first examining potential safety and security implications. The Czech Republic currently holds the rotating <a href="http://www.eu2009.cz/en/">European Presidency</a> [Czech presidency website]. After meeting with the <a href="http://consilium.europa.eu/showPage.aspx?id=249&lang=en">EU Justice and Home Affairs Council</a> [official website], Langer explained that while the decision to accept Guantanamo detainees is within the hands of each member nation individually, any decision to do so will affect all member nations due to the EU&#39;s lack of internal border controls.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Foreign ministers of the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN) [official website] meeting in Thailand said Friday they had held <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/22313.pdf">discussions</a> [press release] on a draft charter for the already-controversial ASEAN Human Rights Body (AHRB), which Thai officials have said they expect to be formally created during Thailand&#39;s chairmanship of ASEAN this year. The group said that AHRB will &quot;promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms&quot; but will likely lack the power to sanction member states for violations, according to a copy of the draft terms <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jKGSctnevG9LndlMcz4Twj6Kt4jwD96JT5883">obtained</a> [AP report] by the Associated Press. In a press release, the ASEAN foreign ministers characterized the AHRB as a tool to promote cooperation on common rights issues:<br /><blockquote>The AHRB is a part of ongoing regional efforts to help realize a truly people-centered ASEAN Community by 2015. The objectives of the AHRB is the creation of an organization that will promote and protect human rights and help shape and raise human rights standards in ASEAN according to the regional context and act as a channel for constructive cooperation on the issue of human rights for ASEAN Member States. In addition, the Foreign Ministers emphasized that the AHRB should be credible, realistic, effective and evolutionary.</blockquote>Charter drafting committee chairman Sihasak Phuangketkeow also said that the AHRB may have the power to investigate potential abuses, despite <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/myanmar-objects-to-monitoring-powers-of.php">previous objections from Myanmar</a> [JURIST report]. Human rights groups reacted to the draft&#39;s announcement by <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/12372/asean-urged-to-move-on-rights">doubting that the body would be strong enough</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] to improve rights in the region, and calling for the AHRB to be given greater powers and independence. A final version of the draft is expected in July.<br /><br />The AHRB has long faced opposition from some ASEAN states that think it goes too far, as well as rights groups that think it does not go far enough. In 2008, Myanmar called on ASEAN to<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/myanmar-objects-to-monitoring-powers-of.php">refrain from interfering</a> [JURIST report] in the internal affairs of ASEAN member nations. ASEAN&#39;s failure thusfar to create effective checks on abuses has also been <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/asean-urged-to-put-rights-component-of.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] because of Myanmar&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Myanmar+human+rights">human rights record</a> [JURIST news archive]. A human rights body was provided for under the terms of ASEAN&#39;s 2007 charter but so far ASEAN has only <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/asean-countries-reach-preliminary.php">agreed to the body in principal</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate on Thursday approved the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c111:9:./temp/~c111fUstVQ::">District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009</a> (S 160) [text] by a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00073">61-37 vote</a> [roll call]. The legislation gives the residents of the District of Columbia (DC) voting representation in the House of Representatives and also gives Utah an additional seat in the House. The Act was <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.157:">introduced into the House</a> (HR 157) [bill summary] by DC delegate <a href="http://www.norton.house.gov">Eleanor Holmes Norton</a> [official website] on January 6 and into the Senate on the same day by Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (CT) and <a href="http://hatch.senate.gov/">Orrin Hatch</a> (UT) [official websites]. Approval of the bill may yet be impeded by <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r111:FLD001:S02491">Amendment 575</a> [text; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SP00575">materials</a>], introduced by <a href="http://ensign.senate.gov/public/">Senator John Ensign</a> (R-NV) [official website], which seeks to counter DC&#39;s strict gun laws by attempting to &quot;restore Second Amendment rights.&quot; The amendment, passed 62-36, calls for the repeal of strict firearms registration requirements, lifts bans on semi-automatic weapons and handgun ammunition, and limits DC&#39;s ability to restrict federally allowed firearms and other gun-related provisions. The overall Act has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives.<br /><br />The House <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/house-passes-dc-congressional-voting.php">previously approved</a> a DC voting rights bill in 2007, although it was later <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-senate-kills-dc-congressional-voting.php">rejected by the Senate</a> [JURIST reports]. Eleanor Holmes Norton is the current House delegate for DC and is not allowed to vote on the final passage of bills. DC residents have been <a href="http://dpc.senate.gov/dpc-new.cfm?doc_name=lb-111-1-25">trying to obtain a voting seat in the House since 1801</a> [DPC backgrounder] but have been opposed on Constitutional grounds. Article I, Section 2 of the US Constitution has <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-house-vote-for-dc-might-be.php">stood in the way</a> [JURIST report] of such voting rights by granting representation only to the &quot;People of the several States.&quot; Supporters of DC voting rights cite Article I, Section 8, which provides that Congress shall have exclusive legislative authority over the District. In December, DC <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/dc-council-passes-legislation.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] increasing the restrictions on gun ownership after the Supreme Court in June <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">prohibited</a> [JURIST report] a gun ban in DC on Second Amendment grounds.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] Friday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2009/02/27/09_15266_Al%20Haramain_v_Obama_order.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] an appeal by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/index.html">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] seeking to stop a <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/islamic-charity-sues-to-shut-down-nsa.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by an Islamic charity alleging it was the subject of an illegal wiretap by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website]. The denial upholds last month&#39;s <a href="/pdf/walkernsa.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-revives-islamic-charity.php">report</a>] by US District Judge Vaughn Walker allowing the case brought by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Al-Haramain+charity">al-Haramain Islamic Foundation</a> [JURIST news archive] to go forward. At the heart of the appeal was the Obama administration&#39;s fight to keep a classified document, a call log which allegedly shows the foundation had been wiretapped, secret. The call log had been deemed a <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=State_secrets_privilege">state secret</a> [SourceWatch backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-rules-against.php">report</a>] but Vaughn&#39;s decision had ordered the government to allow the foundation to view the document.  The DOJ had argued that allowing the lawsuit to proceed would jeopardize national security. While the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4sj03-Gb3HZUn9lqMmn4QKH30mwD96KADA00">denial of the appeal</a> [AP report] appears to grant al-Haramain&#39;s lawyers access, the DOJ argued in a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/27/MNQI166PAV.DTL&tsp=1">filing</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] just hours after the appeals court ruling that the original order has no authority.<br /><br />The document was accidentally released to Al-Haramain in 2004 during the DOJ&#39;s investigation which ultimately lead to the foundation being classified as a terrorist organization. The original <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/islamic-charity-sues-to-shut-down-nsa.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], filed by the foundation in February 2006, alleged that the NSA illegally taped several conversations between the charity and its lawyers. Walker had previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-rules-executive-privilege.php">dismissed the suit</a> [JURIST report], finding that Al-Haramain lacked a cause of action because the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive] trumped procedural requirements under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FISA">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/ali_saleh_kahlah_al_marri/index.html"> Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=ali+al-marri">news archive</a>], a suspected Al Qaeda operative held in the Navy brig in South Carolina since 2003, is to be officially charged and tried in US federal court, according to news reports. Al-Marri, a legal US resident, was arrested in December 2001 in Peoria, Illinois and charged with being part of a terrorist sleeper cell and is the only person held as an enemy combatant in the United States. He is expected to be charged with providing material aid to terrorists. The move comes just two months before the Supreme Court is to hold hearings on al-Marri&#39;s <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/al-marri-cert-petition-9-19-08.pdf">petition</a> [cert. petition, PDF] for <em>habeas corpus</em>. The government is expected to ask for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/court-trial-for-al-marri/">dismissal</a> [SCOTUSblog post] of the case as being moot but al-Marri&#39;s lawyer Jonathan Hafetz said he will <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38843prs20090226.html">oppose</a> [press release] a dismissal and ask for a ruling on the merits: <blockquote>If true, the decision to charge al-Marri is an important step in restoring the rule of law and is what should have happened seven years ago when he was first arrested. But it is vital that the Supreme Court case go forward because it must be made clear once and for all that indefinite military detention of persons arrested in the U.S. is illegal and that this will never happen again.</blockquote>In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ReviewoftheDetentionofAliSalehKahlah/">executive order</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-immediate-review-of.php">report</a>] directing a review of his case. Al-Marri has previously claimed he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/enemy-combatant-detained-in-military.php">abused in detention</a> [JURIST report]. Previously, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had issued a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds.php">upholding</a> [JURIST report] al-Marri&#39;s detention as an enemy combatant as lawful and within presidential power. <br /><br />3:15 PM ET - The federal grand jury <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/terrorism/usalmarri22609ind.html">indictment</a> [text] of al-Marri was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-ag-177.html">unsealed</a> [DOJ press release] Friday. He is formally charged with two counts of providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring with others to provide material support to al Qaeda. The Justice Department says the Solicitor General will now move to dismiss al-Marri&#39;s pending litigation before the US Supreme Court.<br /><br />6:30 PM ET - The government has filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/motion-to-dismiss-al-marri.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] to dismiss al-Marri&#39;s pending litigation before the US Supreme Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/terrorism/rapporteur/srchr.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scheinin">news archive</a>] has called for greater protection of individual rights and increased oversight of intelligence agencies in a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.3.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to be presented to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website]. The report, obtained by AP, is critical of the weak supervision of intelligence agencies by national governments after the agencies were given increased power in the wake of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Scheinin&#39;s report particularly criticizes joint counterterrorism operations organized by the United States, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/26/AR2009022603325.html">presence of foreign intelligence agents</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] during the interrogation of terrorism suspects, and the use of non-traditional and extra-statutory powers to arrest, detain, and interrogate terrorism suspects. Scheinin concludes:<blockquote>The increased powers of intelligence services to conduct measures that seriously interfere with individuals&#8217; rights, as well as the increasing relevance of intelligence for legal and administrative actions, make it essential that adequate accountability mechanisms are put in place to prevent human rights abuses. Under international human rights law, States are under a positive obligation to conduct independent investigations into alleged violations of the right to life, freedom from torture or other inhuman treatment, enforced disappearances or arbitrary detention, to bring to justice those responsible for such acts, and to provide reparations where they have participated in such violations. States retain this positive obligation to protect human rights where they grant privileges within their national territory to another State, including to intelligence services.</blockquote>The report recommends creating legislative intelligence oversight committees with wide-ranging investigative powers, increased transparency for the actions of intelligence agencies, and the creation and adoption by the UN High Commission for Human Rights of guidelines for human rights compliance and best practices for intelligence agencies.<br /><br />Scheinin has been a vocal proponent of greater limits on the power of intelligence agencies to act with limited safeguards under the justification of national security. In October 2008, he urged the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-rights-expert-urges-overhaul-of.php">restructure or eliminate</a> [JURIST report] the existing terrorist &quot;blacklisting&quot; system. In June 2008, he called on the US to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-should-expedite-guantanamo-closure.php">set a concrete deadline</a> [JURIST report] for closure of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, a task <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">accomplished</a> [JURIST report] in January 2009 by President Barack Obama. In May 2008, he urged Spain to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/un-expert-urges-spain-to-reform-legal.php">reform its legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for the treatment of suspected terrorists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia&#39;s <a href="http://eng.genproc.gov.ru/news/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website] on Friday appealed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/russia-journalist-murder-suspects.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST report] of three Chechen men accused of involvement in the killing of Russian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya">news archive</a>]. The decision to appeal the ruling was reportedly made <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090227/120341333.html">shortly after</a> [RIA Novosti report] Moscow Military Court judge Yevgeny Zubov referred the case back to the office last week. The defendants&#39; acquittal came a day after a jury found that the evidence presented against Sergei Khadzhikurbanov and Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov was insufficient to convict them for the crime.  Prosecutor Vera Pashkovskaya said the appeal was based on trial <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=13607206&PageNum=0">violations</a> [ITAR-TASS report] of the Russian code of criminal procedure, which may have inappropriately influenced jurors.<br /><br />Politskovkaya, who gained recognition for her <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=4079894&postID=116065565827069835">investigative reports</a> [JURIST report] on torture in Chechnya, was murdered in her Moscow apartment building in 2006.  The killing has been described by police as a contract killing in which the three men are <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-charges-three-chechens-with.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of playing minor roles. A lawyer for one of the accused alleged just before the acquittal that prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/politkovskaya-murder-suspect-alleges.php">fabricated evidence</a> [JURIST report] and pointed to other irregularities in the evidence, including a lost DVD with security camera footage and claims of other prosecutorial misconduct.  Since the trial began in October, judge Yevgeniy Zubov has closed and then opened the proceedings to the public <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zubov">three times</a> [JURIST news archive], citing juror security concerns and the presentation of classified information.  After last week&#39;s jury finding, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] urged Russian authorities to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/russian-federation-anna-politkovskaya-s-trial-closes-investigation-must-">continue the investigation</a> [press release] of Politkovskaya&#39;s killing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A number of advocacy, rights and philanthropic groups filed an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/kindhearts_amicus.pdf">amicus curiae brief</a> [text, PDF; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/discrim/38853prs20090227.html">press release</a>] Friday with the US <a href="http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Northern District of Ohio</a> [official website] arguing against the classification of some charitable groups as terrorist organizations without due process. The brief, filed by the groups to support the plaintiffs in <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/discrim/38636res20081009.html">KindHearts for Charitable Humanitarian Development, Inc. v. Paulson et al</a> [ACLU backgrounder and materials], argues that the designation of charitable groups as terrorist organizations without due process violates the groups&#39; constitutional rights and discourage and undermine their humanitarian aid efforts. KindHearts is being represented in the litigation by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. Among the organizations supporting the brief are <a href="http://www.internationaldonors.org/">Grantmakers Without Borders</a>, <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/">OMB Watch</a>, and the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> [advocacy websites]. The amicus groups argue:<blockquote>NPOs [Non-Profit Organizations] are in fact the government&#8217;s allies in the global effort to prevent the growth and spread of terrorist organizations and activities. By providing humanitarian aid, by encouraging economic development, and by enhancing the prospects for the future for those in need, NPOs work to prevent people from losing hope. They work to prevent societies from breaking down, countries from fragmenting. This work helps to prevent the emergence of violent extremism. Unfortunately, at a time when the U.S. has so much to gain by supporting international philanthropy, such work is instead becoming increasingly difficult. NPOs should be treated as allies in the global effort to counter terrorism, but instead they have become targets and casualties. Not only are the government&#8217;s actions and policies unconstitutional, but they also discourage and undermine the critical humanitarian aid provided by NPOs, and thus they are counterproductive to the government&#8217;s own counter-terrorism goals.</blockquote><a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/kindhearts_complaint.pdf">KindHearts v. Paulson</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in October 2008 in response to an order by the US Treasury Department&#39;s <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/">Office of Foreign Assets Control</a> (OFAC) [official website] that froze the assets of KindHearts for Charitable Humanitarian Development, a Toledo, Ohio based Muslim charity that has provided support to Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and refugee camps in Lebanon, as well as support to those on the US Gulf Coast affected by Hurrican Katrina. According to the complaint, OFAC has alleged that KindHearts has provided support to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive] in both Lebanon and Gaza, but has given limited information to KindHearts regarding the investigation. The complaint alleges that OFAC&#39;s asset freeze, investigation, and refusal to allow KindHearts to dispute OFAC&#39;s findings are arbitrary and capricious, and violates  KindHearts&#39; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment</a> [text] rights. KindHearts is seeking relief including an injunction vacating the OFAC asset freeze and releasing funds to pay for legal defense services,  and a declaratory judgment that OFAC&#39;s actions are <em>ultra vires</em>.

Rukundo, who was a military chaplain and captain in the Rwandan Armed Forces, was found to have used his position as a priest to influence troops to <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Rukundo/indictment/rukundo.pdf">abduct and kill</a> [indictment, PDF] Tutsi refugees hiding in a seminary during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HWR backgrounder]. The ICTR stated that his sentence was increased because he used a position of trust and authority to further the crimes. It also credited Rukundo with the seven-and-a-half years he has already spent in UN custody, leaving the balance of his term at approximately 17 years.<br /><br />In 2003, UN Security Council <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">Resolution 1503</a> [text, PDF] stated that the ICTR should complete all trials by 2008, but last June the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-seeks-more.php">requested additional time</a> [JURIST report]. The contempt trial for a former ICTR defense investigator <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ictr-begins-contempt-trial-of-former.php">began</a> earlier this month, and in January a former justice official was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rwanda-ex-justice-minister-sentenced-to.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to life in prison for his role in the 1994 genocide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/">Supreme Court of Nebraska</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/opinions/2009/february/feb27/s07-010.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that Robert Henderson will not be reinstated as a state trooper for the <a href="http://www.nsp.state.ne.us/">Nebraska State Patrol</a> [official website] because of his membership in the <a href="http://www.kkk.com/">Knights Party</a> [advocacy website], a political group associated with the KKK. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/supreme-court/scjudges/gerrard.shtml?sub1">Justice John M. Gerrard</a> [official profile] wrote: <blockquote>Nebraska public policy precludes an individual from being reinstated to serve as a sworn officer in a law enforcement agency if that individual&#39;s service would severely undermine reasonable public perception that the agency is uniformly committed to the equal enforcement of the law and that each citizen of Nebraska can depend on law enforcement officers to enforce the law without regard to race.</blockquote> Henderson had joined the Knights Party in 2004 and posted on their online forum. In 2006, the State Patrol launched an investigation into his activities and Henderson&#39;s dismissal shortly followed. The Nebraska State Law Enforcement Bargaining Council, the <a href="http://www.netroopers.org/">representative</a> for Nebraska state troopers, filed a grievance on Henderson&#39;s behalf which resulted in arbitration. Friday&#39;s ruling affirmed the district court&#39;s decision vacating the arbitration award in favor of Henderson&#39;s reinstatement.<br /><br />The US has recently experienced a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/klan-members-ordered-to-pay-25-million.php">resurgence</a> [JURIST report] of hate groups such as the KKK, possibly related to increased public attention to immigration issues. The resurgence is in spite of dwindling Klan membership and the continuing <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-group-claims-immigration-fears.php">prosecution and conviction of Klan members</a> [JURIST report] for hate crimes.
