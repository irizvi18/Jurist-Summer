The commission <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iHkf2vg4rDSOm7HiLKTX8hfLdbtw">plans to look into accusations</a> [AFP report] that former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gloria+arroyo">news archive</a>] and members of her administration rigged the 2004 presidential election, misused government funds and profited from government contracts. Aquino said that <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49743820100629">other agencies will assist the commission</a> [Reuters report] in its investigation, including the country's <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Department of Justice</a> [official website]. Aquino's announcement prompted a call for the president to <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/30/10/noynoy-urged-issue-eo-truth-commission">issue an executive order</a> [ABS-CBN report] to make the commission's creation official and clear up any ambiguity regarding the commission's authority. Aquino appointed former <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] chief justice <a href="http://www.un.int/philippines/about/davide_bio.htm">Hilario Davide</a> [UN profile] to head the commission.

<p>Arroyo was elected to the lower house of parliament after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">receiving permission to run for the seat</a> [JURIST report] in April despite protests that her presidency gave her an unfair advantage. In March, Aquino and other presidential candidates criticized as "unjust" a Supreme Court ruling that allowed Arroyo to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">appoint a replacement for the retiring chief justice</a> [JURIST report], who planned to step down a week after the May presidential elections. Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] in December for the first time in 23 years in the wake of a massacre in the Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. In February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">prosecutors charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the massacre. A Manila trial court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-189.php">ordered the arrest of 189 more suspects</a> [JURIST report] in March. Eleven policemen and militia members <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/philippines-police-plead-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Italy</a> [judgment, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/europe-rights-court-rules-crucifixes-in.php">report</a>], where the ECHR found an Italian school's display of the crucifix in classrooms violated Articles 2 and 9 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], regarding religious and educational freedoms. Italy appealed the decision, arguing that the crucifix is a part of the country's <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-49786020100630">national identity</a> [Reuters report]. Ten other countries&#8212;Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Romania and Russia&#8212;joined Italy in its appeal. One lawyer argued the ban would force countries to remove religious references from their flags and national anthems. The 19-judge chamber is expected to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iPGhvn5-JIJq1wRL9Hm3MFcVKk2QD9GLNDA00">announce its ruling in September or October</a> [AP report].

<p>In November, the Greek Orthodox Church <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/greek-orthodox-church-protesting-echr.php">urged Europeans to unite in protesting</a> [JURIST report] the decision. Earlier this month, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/europe-rights-court-overturns-russian-ban-on-jehovahs-witnesses.php">overturned a Russian ban on Jehovah's Witnesses</a> [JURIST report], finding that the ban denied congregations their right to religious freedom. In December, a Swiss Muslim <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-minaret-ban-challenged-in.php">filed a complaint in the ECHR</a> after Swiss voters approved a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/switzerland-voters-approve-ban-on.php">ban on construction of Islamic towers</a> [JURIST reports] known as minarets, alleging violations of religious freedom and freedom from discrimination.

ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/149">President Judge Patrick Robinson</a> [official profile] addressed the Security Council on the importance of this issue, stating that "a failure to take action immediately on the rate of staff attrition at the Tribunal will have profound effects on the ability of the Tribunal to complete its mandate as expeditiously as possible." The new resolution will extend the terms of office for five appeals judges to the end of 2012, and the terms of eight permanent trial and 10 <em>ad litem</em> judges until the end of 2011, or until the completion of the caseload if sooner. The latest completion strategy report estimates that all first instance trials will be completed by mid-2012 with the exception of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>], which is expected to finish in late 2012. Most appellate work is scheduled to be completed by early 2014. 

<p>In March, UN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] said that the ICTY will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-to-remain-in-operation-beyond-2010.php">continue to operate</a> [JURIST report] beyond its originally planned end date in part to apprehend the two indictees still at large, former Bosnian Serb Commander <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/mladic/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>] and former Croatian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/694/4">Goran Hadzic</a> [case materials], who both face a significant number of charges. In May, the ICTY amended the indictment of Mladic in order to help speed up the court proceedings once he is captured. Mladic's family members, who have not seen or heard from Mladic in seven years, recently asked for the former commander to be <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php">declared dead by the Serbian government</a> [JURIST report]. Mladic is wanted on 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and violations of the laws and customs of war during the 1992-1995  <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hadzic, who was last seen <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/photos-show-war-crimes-suspect-fleeing.htm">fleeing his home</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia in 2004, faces crimes against humanity charges for killings of non-Serbs and for abuses in Croatian prison camps between 1991 and 1995.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Munyakazi was liable for the deaths of more than 5,000 Tutsi civilians during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>] and that he "intended to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group in whole or in part." Munyakazi had also been charged with complicity in genocide, but the court found that there was not enough evidence to convict him on the charges related to the distribution of weapons and the providing of material support to the militia involved in the killings. Rwandan authorities had sought to have Munyakazi transferred to Rwanda for trial, but that request and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ictr-upholds-decision-to-refuse.php">subsequent appeal were both denied</a> [JURIST report] based on concerns that the judiciary in Rwanda may not be fully independent and immune from outside pressure. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/rwanda-justice-officials-criticize-ictr.php">criticized the decision</a> [JURIST report] and insisted that Rwanda's judicial system was fully independent and capable of guaranteeing a fair trial. Munyakazi was sentenced to 25 years in prison and will remain in custody at the UN Detention Facility in Arusha, Tanzania, pending transfer to the country where he will serve out his sentence. 

<p>The ICTR continues its work to prosecute those most responsible for the Rwandan genocide, in which nearly 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, were killed. Last month, the ICTR Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-convicted-former-colonel.php">heard arguments in an appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed on behalf of former Rwandan Armed Forces Colonel <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=96&mnid=3">Tharcisse Renzaho</a> [case materials]. Renzaho was <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Renzaho/judgement/090714.pdf">sentenced to life in prison</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-gives-military.php">report</a>] last year after he was convicted of crimes relating to the genocide in Rwanda. Also last month, the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-convicted-former-priest.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of Emmanuel Rukundo, a priest convicted of genocide and other charges last year. In March, the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-tribunal-affirms-genocide.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the genocide conviction of popular Rwandan singer-songwriter Simon Bikindi. Also in March, the Appeals Chamber reversed several convictions against Rwandan district attorney Simeon Nchamihigo including murder and extermination as crimes against humanity and three counts of genocide. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report claims that the Cuban legal system allows the government to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/restrictions-freedom-expression-create-climate-fear-cuba-2010-06-30">restrict content provided to the media</a> [press release] and to use the restricted content to prosecute hundreds of dissidents. AI said that Cuba's criminal code is vague and can easily be interpreted in a way that infringes fundamental freedoms. The report stated that the laws, which are used to curb legitimate expression of opinion and dissent, are coupled with a corrupt police force and a biased judiciary, leading to several arbitrary arrests and convictions.<blockquote>The current legal framework and the way in which it is enforced by the authorities seriously limits freedom of expression. ... People continue to face unfounded criminal prosecution, as well as harassment and intimidation by state security and police officials, for expressing and distributing information or opinions critical of the government. Unlawful restrictions on freedom of expression are underpinned by other restrictions on human rights, such as the rights to freedom of association, of peaceful assembly and of movement. Arbitrary detention, interrogations and warnings at police stations, and other forms of temporary arrests are frequently used by the authorities to intimidate individuals critical of the prevailing state system. ... The judiciary is neither independent nor impartial and allows criminal proceedings to be brought against those critical of the government as a mechanism to prevent, deter or punish them for expressing dissenting views. The complicity of the state judicial system in prosecuting government critics, often in summary trials that fail to meet international fair trial standards has a profound chilling effect on freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.</blockquote>The state-run media has a monopoly over broadcast media and the press, as private ownership of mass media is prohibited under the Cuban constitution. To circumvent the private media blockade, many Cubans rely the Internet and new communications technologies to express ideas and opinions. These technologies are less regulated by the government, allowing Cubans to receive and impart information for which they would otherwise be prosecuted. Several small independent press agencies still operate within Cuba illegally but are regularly facing prosecution for news that goes against the government's grain.

<p>The report follows a statement released by AI in March <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-revoke-laws.php">urging the Cuban authorities</a> [JURIST report] to "revoke laws that restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association and to release all dissidents unfairly detained by the authorities." Also in March, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] criticized Cuba for interfering with the right to privacy in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">report</a>]. In November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/cuba1109web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cuba-continues-political-repression.php">report</a>] claiming that the Cuban government continued to repress dissidents and violate fundamental civil liberties of Cubans, and resorted to imposing short-term imprisonment measures to elude international critique. According to a February 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/todo-sobre/organismo/CCDHRN/Comision/Cubana/Derechos/Humanos/Reconciliacion/Nacional/575/">Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation</a> (CCDHRN) [<em>El Pais</em> backgrounder, in Spanish], the number of political prisoners in Cuba had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-reports-decline-in-number.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] from 234 in January 2008 to 205, while the number of brief detentions had increased. In 2008, Cuba was ranked 170th in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/press-freedom-index-moves-us-up-war.php">eighth annual Worldwide Index of Press Freedom</a> [JURIST report] issued by <a href="http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=20">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RWB) [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-senate-reconcile-financial-reform-bills.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the final version of the bill last week, but were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65L4A920100701">forced to re-open negotiations</a> [Reuters report] this week following the death of Democratic <a href="http://byrd.senate.gov/">Senator Robert Byrd</a> (WV) [official website] in order to ensure the bill's final passage in the Senate. The biggest concession made in order to gain Republican support for the bill was the removal of a $17.9 billion tax on large financial institutions that was meant to cover the bill's costs. The final bill creates a new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent the companies from becoming "too big to fail." It also gives the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] the power to supervise the largest financial companies and report to the government any risks the firms may pose to the economy at large. Additionally, a new consumer protection division will be established within the Federal Reserve to enforce rules against certain business practices like abusive mortgage lending and some credit card practices. As a final protection against future bailouts, the government will have the ability to seize and liquidate failing financial institutions before their collapse can have an adverse affect on the entire economy. The so-called "Volcker Rule" is included in the final bill, but instead of prohibiting banks from owning hedge funds, banks will be permitted to invest up to 3 percent of their capital into hedge funds or private equity funds. The final bill also includes regulation of some derivatives, requiring that they be bought and sold through clearinghouses or exchanges. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-passage-financial-reform">praised the passage of the bill</a> [press release], as well as its content, stating:<blockquote>It will put in place the strongest consumer financial protections in history, curbing abuses by banks, mortgage and credit card companies and giving their customers the information they need to make responsible financial decisions.  It will make our financial system more transparent, so that complex transactions that escaped scrutiny in the past will now be done in the light of day.  And it will put an end to the idea that any financial firm is too big to fail, and therefore entitled to taxpayer bailouts.</blockquote>The Senate is expected to vote on the final bill later this month. 

<p>The Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-senate-approves-financial-reform-legislation.php">approved its version</a> of the financial reform bill in May, after the House <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] in December. The Senate <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Banking Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf">proposed a bill</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">report</a>] in 2009 that was met with resistance and resulted in the committee's development of the bill ultimately passed by the Senate. One provision in the bill that has been the source of much debate is the creation of a consumer protection agency. The House <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> to create the agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders last July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving the Obama administration's stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. Last June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/facecoveringsregulation.html">Face Coverings (Regulation) Bill</a> [materials] was introduced by <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/philip-hollobone/31683">MP Philip Hollobone</a> [official website] in order to regulate the covering of the face in public and, if passed, would prohibit the wearing of both the burqa and the niqab. Hollobone has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/politics/10465209.stm">outspoken</a> [BBC report] about the wearing of the burqa, indicating that it goes against British values. He also suggested that no one should be allowed to conceal their identity from the public. The bill is scheduled for a second reading in December and would then proceed to the committee phase of the legislative process. Due to the parliamentary process used by the UK, the bill is unlikely to progress beyond the reading phase. Hollobone was selected as part of a random process allowing individual MPs to introduce legislation for consideration. He was selected late in the process, which would decrease the chance that his legislation would move forward.

<p>Many European jurisdictions continue to consider legislation banning the burqa. Last month, the Spanish <a href="http://www.senado.es/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.senado.es/cgi-bin/verNoticia?IDITEM=486">approved a motion</a> [press release, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/spain-senate-calls-for-government-ban-of-face-veils.php?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+pitt%2FvLdl+(JURIST+-+Paper+Chase+%5Bfull%5D)">report</a>] calling on the Spanish government to ban the use of full face veils in public places. Also last month, the <a href="http://w3.bcn.es/XMLServeis/XMLHomeLinkPl/0,4022,200713899_200720824_1,00.html">Barcelona city council</a> [official website, in Catalan] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/spain-city-bans-use-of-face-veil-in-public-areas-managed-by-the-city.php">passed a ban</a> [JURIST report] on face coverings in all public places. In May, the French Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/france-cabinent-approves-legislation-to-ban-burqa.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would ban the wearing of the burqa or other face veils in public.

The documents illustrate how Goldsmith repeatedly warned Blair that UN Security Council <a href="http://www.c-span.org/Content/PDF/UN1441.pdf">resolution 1441</a> [text, PDF], which offered Iraq under Saddam Hussein "a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations," did not authorize military force. In a <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/46496/Goldsmith-note-to-PM-30January2003.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the former PM dated January 30, 2003, Goldsmith stated:<blockquote>In view of your meeting with President Bush on Friday, I thought you might wish to know where I stand on the question of whether a further decision of the [UN] security council is legally required in order to authorise the use of force against Iraq. I remain of the view that the correct legal interpretation of resolution 1441 is that it does not authorise the use of force without a further determination by the security council. My view remains that a further [UN] decision is required.</blockquote>Blair illustrated his frustration with Goldsmith's legal advice by scribbling "I just don't understand this" in the margins. The release of the documents will make it difficult for Blair to use a good-faith defense against charges that he knowingly led the country into an illegal invasion. 

<p>The Iraq Inquiry, led by Sir John Chilcot, was created by former prime minister <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/gordon-brown">Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] in 2009 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uk-panel-begins-investigation-into.php">identify lessons that can be learned</a> [JURIST report] from the Iraq invasion. In January, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/former-uk-ag-warned-cabinet-iraq.php">inquiry released a 2002 letter</a> [JURIST report] from Goldsmith to former secretary of defense <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8443972.stm">Geoff Hoon</a> [BBC profile] in which Goldsmith warned the Cabinet that the Iraq invasion was not supported by international law. Former chief legal adviser to the UK's <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ha/notewriters/wood.pdf">Sir Michael Wood</a> [UN profile, PDF] told the Iraq Inquiry in January that he had advised the Foreign Ministry that the invasion was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/former-uk-legal-advisor-testifies-iraq.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report]. During a public hearing in February, former UK international development secretary Clare Short told the inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-uk-cabinet-member-claims-blair.php">Blair was "misleading" and "deceitful"</a> [JURIST report] with the Cabinet and parliament regarding the Iraq invasion. Additionally in February, former UK Foreign Ministry secretary <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/person/5038/jack-straw">Jack Straw</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-uk-foreign-minister-denies.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that he did not ignore legal advice that the invasion of Iraq lacked basis in international law. <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-pm-defends-legality-of-iraq-invasion.php">Brown also testified before the inquiry</a> [JURIST report] in March stating that he remains convinced that the decision to participate in the 2003 Iraq invasion was the appropriate course of action. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ngoga reiterated Rwanda's commitment to honoring its obligations under the <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/AboutICTR/FactSheet/InternationalCooperationwiththeTribunal/tabid/113/Default.aspx">Memorandum of Understanding</a> [materials]. The cooperation between the Rwandan government and the ICTR was illustrated last month when the ICTR <a href="http://appablog.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/ictr-more-prosecution%E2%80%99s-case-files-transferred-to-rwanda/">transferred the cases</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">report</a>] of 25 suspects to the Rwandan authorities. The suspects, who have been investigated but not yet indicted by the ICTR, are believed to be in hiding abroad. Ngoga also assured ICTR defense lawyers that they can work in Rwanda without fear of interference by authorities. He commented specifically on the case of US lawyer and <a href="/forum/">JURIST forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erlinder">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrested and detained</a> [JURIST report] in Rwanda on charges of genocide denial. Ngoga stated that Erlinder's arrest was unrelated to his work with the ICTR and that it will have no effect on other ICTR defense lawyers working in the country. 

<p>Last month, ICTR defense lawyers <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/jun/08/statement-defence-rwanda-peter-erlinder">released a statement</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-defense-lawyers-call-for-release-of-us-lawyer-threaten-boycott.php">calling for Erlinder's release</a> [JURIST report] and threatening to boycott other ICTR trials until international authorities worked to obtain Erlinder's release and to guarantee immunity for "every person engaged in seeking truth before any international or domestic jurisdiction." Erlinder was in Rwanda to prepare his defense of opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://www.victoire2010.com/english/index.html">Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza</a> [campaign website], who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested in April</a> [JURIST report] on similar charges. Erlinder <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-lawyer-pleads-not-guilty-to-rwanda-genocide-denial.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report], but was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXb0DUaj8ErmZ2ZIcGeQT1QJPTVA">deemed a flight risk</a> [AFP report] and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rwanda-judge-denies-bail-application-by-us-lawyer.php">denied bail</a>, despite his claim that he needed to return to the US for medical treatment following what Rwandan officials say was a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rwanda-officials-claim-detained-us-lawyer-attempted-suicide.php">suicide attempt</a> [JURIST reports]. Rwandan authorities ultimately reversed their decision, and Erlinder was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-lawyer-in-rwanda-custody-released-on-bail.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report]. He <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/lawyer-freed-from-rwanda-returns-to-us.php">returned to the US last month</a> [JURIST report], after agreeing to the terms of his release set by the Rwandan court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The brief was filed in support of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], challenging the constitutionality of the Arizona legislation. According to the brief, "the ABA has long opposed initiatives such as S.B. 1070, which, by their plain language, can only be implemented by intruding on the civil rights of both citizens and noncitizens." The ABA argues that the <a href="http://www.abanow.org/2010/06/aba-president-says-an-extraordinary-law-%E2%80%A6-requires-extraordinary-action/">federal government should have exclusive power</a> [press release] over immigration issues. In addition, the brief, which was filed in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website], states that the law will increase the use of racial profiling, result in unlawful and unreasonable detentions and increase the burden on the state's indigent defense system. The ABA usually waits until a case reaches the appellate level to file an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief, but ABA <a href="http://www.whitecase.com/clamm/">President Carolyn Lamm</a> [professional profile] said this case requires "extraordinary action:"

<p><object height="198" width="300"><param value="http://www.abanow.org/video_player.swf?id=11504" name="movie"/><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen"/><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess"/><embed height="198" width="300" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.abanow.org/video_player.swf?id=11504"/></object></p>

<p>The Arizona immigration bill requires that police seek proof of a person's immigration status if they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally. The law is set to go into effect in January 2011. </p>

<p>Last week, the Mexican government filed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mexico-asks-judge-to-strike-down-arizona-immigration-law.php"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] supporting the ACLU suit, claiming a substantial interest in ensuring its "bilateral diplomatic relations" with the US remain "transparent, consistent and reliable, and not frustrated by the actions of individual US states." The government also claims an interest in ensuring that its citizens are "accorded human and civil rights when present in the US in accordance with federal immigration law." Arizona's new immigration law has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling, since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] in April. In addition to the class action filed by the ACLU, Brewer is also currently facing federal lawsuits filed by the  <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration-law.php">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> and several <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Tuscon police officers</a>, who claim they can not properly implement the law without racially profiling. The Obama administration, though supporting immigration reform, has <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-reaffirms-support-for-federal-immigration-reform.php">sharply criticized the law</a> [JURIST report], calling it "misguided" and expressing concern that it could be applied in a discriminatory fashion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Due to their status, the plaintiffs are prohibited from flying to or from the US or over US airspace. According to the complaint, thousands of people, including the plaintiffs, were never informed as to why they were placed on the list or given a chance to clear their names. The list has left several individuals stranded abroad including plaintiffs Ayman Latif, a disabled US Marine Corps veteran stranded in Egypt, and Raymond Earl Knaeble a US Army veteran stuck in Colombia. The complaint outlined that consequences of the government adding individuals to the list without appropriate safeguards in place:<blockquote>The United States' system of screening commercial airline passengers against databases of suspected terrorists is broken. Thousands of people have been barred altogether from commercial air travel without any opportunity to confront or rebut the basis for their inclusion, or apparent inclusion, on a government watch list known as the "No Fly List." The result is a vast and growing list of individuals whom, on the basis of error or innuendo, the government deems too dangerous to fly, but too harmless to arrest. Many of these individuals, like the Plaintiffs in this action, are citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States; some, including three Plaintiffs in this action, are veterans of the United States Armed Forces. Some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents have been placed on the list while traveling abroad and therefore have found themselves stranded in foreign countries, without explanation or appropriate visas, unable to return home to their families, jobs, and needed medical care in the United States. The Constitution does not permit such a fundamental deprivation of rights to be carried out under a veil of secrecy and in the absence of even rudimentary process.</blockquote>The ACLU, along with its affiliates in Oregon, Southern California, Northern California and New Mexico, filed suit in the <a href="http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> against the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ), the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">FBI</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/counterrorism/mission.htm">Terrorist Screening Center</a> [official websites]. 

<p>In 2006, the FBI and the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/public/">Transportation Security Administration</a> [official website] agreed to pay the ACLU $200,000 in attorney's fees to settle a case brought by the civil rights organization in 2003 <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aclu-settles-no-fly-list-case-with-us.php">challenging the government's no-fly list</a> [JURIST report] and requesting the disclosure of records. The documents noted that construction of the list was based on "two primary principles," but that there were "no hard and fast" rules governing decisions of who was put on the list. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in 2008 that those placed on the government's "no-fly list" can <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ninth-circuit-rules-people-on-no-fly.php">challenge their inclusion on the list</a> [JURIST report] in federal district courts. The court held that the Terrorist Screening Center, which actually maintains the list, is a subsection of the FBI and is therefore subject to review by the district courts. Also in 2008, the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/plus/a0816/final.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] saying that the FBI had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/fbi-submitted-inaccurate-data-to.php">submitted inaccurate information to the list</a> [JURIST report], that the information was rarely reviewed before its submission and even if discrepancies become apparent they were often left unchanged.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontobamapres.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Thursday reiterated the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform">need for comprehensive immigration reform</a> [statement] and called on members of Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass immigration legislation. Obama noted the role of immigrants throughout US history and indicated that immigrants must continue to play a role as the country grows and develops. He acknowledged the continuing difficulty with securing the border but cited efforts made by the administration to improve enforcement of current laws, including increased numbers of enforcement agents. He also acknowledged the frustration that has led states, like Arizona, to enact their own <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">immigration laws</a> [JURIST news archive]. Obama called these laws "ill conceived" and "divisive" and indicated that they are unenforceable. He stated that reform should include holding businesses responsible for hiring and exploiting undocumented workers, a path to citizenship for people living in the US illegally and a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants. Obama endorsed the <a href="http://dreamact.info/">DREAM act</a> [materials], which would allow students who graduate from US high schools, but are not US citizens, to gain citizenship by completing a college degree or serving two years in the US military. He also stressed the need for bipartisanship in order to accomplish immigration reform, stating:<blockquote>I'm ready to move forward; the majority of Democrats are ready to move forward; and I believe the majority of Americans are ready to move forward. But the fact is, without bipartisan support, as we had just a few years ago, we cannot solve this problem. Reform that brings accountability to our immigration system cannot pass without Republican votes. That is the political and mathematical reality. The only way to reduce the risk that this effort will again falter because of politics is if members of both parties are willing to take responsibility for solving this problem once and for all.</blockquote>Opponents of the plan to grant amnesty to some illegal immigrants contend that it would only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/us/politics/02obama.html">encourage further illegal migration</a> [NYT report]. It is unclear whether Congress will have the political will to address immigration reform in an election year. 

<p>Arizona's new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070], which has been seen as an impetus for the renewed immigration debate, has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling. Last month, the Mexican government filed an <a href="http://www.heatcity.org/wp-content/uploads/Amicus-Curiae-Brief-on-Behalf-of-Mexico.pdf"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] asking that the law be <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mexico-asks-judge-to-strike-down-arizona-immigration-law.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also last month, the city of Tucson, Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">joined a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the state's new immigration law arguing that it law violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text], in addition to federal immigration law, through which the federal government has "fully occupied" the field of immigration control. The Obama administration, though supporting immigration reform, has <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-reaffirms-support-for-federal-immigration-reform.php">sharply criticized the law</a> [JURIST report], calling it "misguided" and expressing concern that it could be applied in a discriminatory fashion. These criticisms are shared by Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, Spanish] who called the law a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/mexico-president-criticizes-arizona.php">"violation of human rights"</a> [JURIST report]. In May, a group of UN experts found that the law could <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-rights-experts-say-arizona-immigration-law-may-violate-international-standards.php">violate international standards</a> [JURIST report] that are binding on the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.4645:">Travel Restriction Reform and Export Enhancement Act</a> [HR 4645 materials], which would eliminate travel bans to Cuba and prohibit money transfer restrictions, will now face a full chamber vote. The bill's sponsor, <a href="http://collinpeterson.house.gov/default.htm">Chairman Collin Peterson</a> (D-MN) [official website], suggested, "increasing trade with Cuba will encourage democratic progress." A similar <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:s.428:">bill</a> [S 428 materials] is pending in the US <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website].

Planning to push the bill to a vote in the remaining weeks of the legislative session, Dorgan said, "[t]he nearly 50-year embargo and travel ban restricting Americans' right to travel to Cuba has been a failure. The quickest way to bring democracy to Cuba is through travel and trade." <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/">Senator Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) plans to <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=f7d34088-4122-4d27-af29-7eee246a07bc">oppose the bill and filibuster</a> [press release] any attempt to pass it.

<p>A <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-874">version of the bill</a> [HR 874 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cuba-travel-legislation-introduced-in.php">originally introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the House in February 2009. The US <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/">Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] in September <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-treasury-eases-cuba-travel.php">lifted travel restrictions and restrictions on money transfers</a> [JURIST report] between Cuban-Americans and their families in Cuba. The department also authorized US telecommunications companies to work within Cuba to facilitate communication between families split between the two countries. The Obama administration ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php">restrictions to be lifted</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009. Earlier in 2009, Congress approved legislation that relaxed rules <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/cuba-travel-restrictions-tightened.htm">put in place by the Bush administration in 2004</a> [JURIST report].

Representative <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official website] sponsored the bill, calling the previous legislation "ancient" and "outdated." Some Republicans argued that the bill was too broad because it covers all companies operating on the high seas but did not act to block its passage. Representatives from both parties did agree on at least one issue&#8212;that companies directly responsible for the Gulf oil spill should not be allowed to limit damages under outdated laws. The House passed the bill on a voice vote, and was therefore not recorded. The bill will now go before the US Senate.

<p>Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP as evidence of the oil company's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come out. <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">Two lawsuits were recently filed</a> [JURIST report] against BP alleging violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Rackteer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.]. The first lawsuit, a class action filed on behalf of US residents affected by the oil spill, was filed last week and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/062110bpricocomp.pdf">alleges</a> [complaint, PDF] that BP engaged in a scheme to secure profits by deceiving the public. The second suit, filed Monday, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/062810bprico.pdf">alleges</a> [complaint, PDF] that BP has been involved in racketeering and corruption related to the BP claims payment process.  Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] is reviewing whether any criminal or civil <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP resulting in the oil spill.  Holder cited several statutes being examined by government lawyers including the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/lcwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> [materials]. Last month, DC-based consumer advocacy organization <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/">Food and Water Watch</a> (FWW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-drilling-at-bp-gulf-%20platform.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a US district court against the US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of Interior</a> (DOI) and the <a href="http://www.mms.gov/">Minerals Management Service</a> (MMS) [official websites] for an injunction to halt drilling at the <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&amp;contentId=7052055">BP Atlantis Facility</a> [corporate website], another BP Gulf of Mexico site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The indictment alleges that Uwinkindi collaborated with the extremist National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in order to kill Tutsis. He allegedly led a group of Hutus to look for and kill a group of Tutsi settlers and conspired with members of the militia to kill Tutsis who sought protection in the church where he was the pastor. According to the indictment, approximately 2,000 bodies were found near the church where the violence occurred. Uwinkindi had been one of the ICTR's most wanted suspects, with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/10486173.stm">$5 million reward being offered</a> [BBC report] for information leading to his capture. Uwinkindi will be transferred to the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania, where he will stand trial. 

<p>Ugandan officials apprehended another highly-sought genocide suspect last October when they <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/top-rwandan-genocide-suspect-arrested.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former Hutu intelligence chief <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8292684.stm">Idelphonse Nizeyimana</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=100&mnid=1">case materials</a>]. Nizeyimana, who has <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/rwanda-genocide-suspect-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report], was <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/Case/English/Nizeyimana/indictment/index.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with four counts of genocide, or, in the alternative, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity, and is still awaiting trial. Nizeyimana was one of four top accused sought by the ICTR in order to complete its mission. In July 2009, the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/un-extends-terms-for-icty-and-ictr.php">extended the terms</a> [JURIST report] for ICTR judges until December 31, 2010, or until they complete their cases.

The new constitution will allow the interim government to establish a legitimate government through parliamentary elections in the fall. Final results from the referendum showed that the new constitution was adopted by 90.55 percent of the Kyrgyz voters, according to <a href="http://kabar.kg/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2389&Itemid=1">local news reports</a> [Kabar report, in Russian]. Under the new constitution, parliamentary elections will be held every five years, while presidential elections will be held every six years. The office of president will be limited to one six-year term. Interim <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8608656.stm">President Roza Otunbayeva</a> [BBC profile] will continue to lead the country until presidential elections in 2012. The constitution, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-approves-draft-constitution.php">approved by the interim government</a> [JURIST report] in May, shifts power from the president to the prime minister, defines Kyrgyzstan as a secular state and increases the number of seats in parliament from 90 to 120.

<p>The government of Kyrgyzstan chose to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-to-proceed-with-constitutional-referendum-despite-violence.php">proceed with the elections</a> [JURIST report] despite ongoing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/14/kyrgyzstan-conflict-background">ethnic violence</a> [Guardian backgrounder] against the Kyrgyz Uzbek population. Last month, Otunbayeva issued <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-president-issues-shoot-to-kill-order-as-ethnic-violence-continues.php">shoot to kill orders</a> [JURIST report] to the nation's military after the reservists were activated and sent to quell the ethnic conflict that has been primarily focused in the southern cities of Osh and Jalal'abad. The cause of the violence is unclear, but <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay</a> [official website] and witnesses have described it as organized. One suggested motivation for the violence was to cause a delay of the referendum by allies of ousted Kyrgyz president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile]. The interim government has accused the former president's son of paying USD $10 million to finance the violence. He was arrested in the UK earlier this month, and the interim government has promised to seek his extradition. Despite the ongoing violence, voter turnout for the referendum was reported to be about 65 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI claims that <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/new-testimonies-reinforce-call-china-investigate-xinjiang-riots-2010-07-02">police officials committed several human rights violations</a> [press release] during the riots, including arbitrary arrests, shootings to disperse peaceful protesters and the excessive use of force. AI has also called for transparent judicial proceedings in accordance with international standards for those arrested during the riots. Addressing the importance of the new testimony, AI stated in its report:<blockquote>The Chinese authorities have prevented adequate investigation of the July 2009 protests and their background. Consequently, many details of the events remain disputed or are unknown. According to the eyewitness testimonies obtained by Amnesty International, a violent police crackdown on peaceful Uighur demonstrators preceded the eruption of violence on 5 July. Chinese authorities, however, within hours blamed overseas Uighur groups ... for what they described as "premeditated violence" ... a consistent pattern of allegations emerges from the accounts collected by Amnesty International of acts by the security forces that constitute human rights violations which should be fully investigated. It is imperative that the Chinese authorities allow independent and impartial investigation into the events of July 2009, including full access to scenes of confrontation, eyewitnesses, and detainees, whilst ensuring that those providing information to the investigation are protected from harassment, intimidation or punishment.</blockquote>According to official statistics, at least 198 people have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-court-sentences-4-more-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the Xinjiang riots, including 35 death sentences. Nine people are known to have already been executed.

<p>The actions of the Chinese government in the aftermath of the riots have also been <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-xinjiang-riot-trials-fail-to-meet.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. HRW has stated that the trials of the suspected rioters have been marred by infringements on due process and political considerations. Additionally, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-officials-disappeared-uighurs.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that more than 40 <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Uighurs">Uighurs</a> [JURIST news archive] had disappeared while in the custody of Chinese authorities after large-scale sweeps by police. Residents of the region claim that the majority of the deaths were at the hands of Chinese authorities, but Chinese state media has reported that most of the deaths were due to protesters. The Chinese government has admitted that police were <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/china-official-says-police-killed-12-in.php">responsible for 12 of the deaths</a> [JURIST report]. The Muslim Uighur population is <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8137206.stm">opposed</a> [BBC backgrounder] to China's restrictive bans on religious practice and says that the recent influx of Han Chinese has disenfranchised non-Chinese-speaking Uighurs.

They are also trying to determine if the US government shared information about US citizens living abroad and what is being done to ensure the return of citizens who have been detained while abroad. A spokesperson for CCR cited the importance of the information the group is requesting, stating:<blockquote>Serious questions remain unanswered about the US response to the attack, its actions and policies, particularly in the context of the blockade of Gaza, internationally condemned as illegal and unjust. Citizens need to know their government will protect their rights under US and international law vis-a-vis a foreign government, including Israel&#8212;the biggest recipient of US aid over the last fifty years.</blockquote>CCR is also requesting access to information surrounding US policy toward the ongoing Gaza blockade, which has been described by UN officials as <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/un-rights-chief-slams-israeli-blockade.php">"collective punishment"</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] indicated earlier this week that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-considers-widening-scope-of-internal-probe-of-flotilla-raid.php">consider widening the scope</a> of an <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-cabinet-approves-internal-probe-of-flotilla-raid.php">internal probe</a> [JURIST reports] into the flotilla raid, giving investigators the power to subpoena witnesses. The panel has been asked to investigate the events that took place in the early hours of May 31, when Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to the Palestinian territory of Gaza. The raid left numerous wounded and resulted in the shooting deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists: eight Turks and one American. Earlier this month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] reiterated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-sg-urges-international-oversight-in-israeli-flotilla-investigaton.php">importance of an international component</a> [JURIST report] in the investigation into the raid. Ban's original proposal to establish an investigatory panel comprised of representatives from Israel, Turkey, and other unnamed countries, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-rejects-international-inquiry-into-flotilla-attack.php">rejected by Israeli officials</a> [JURIST report]. Israeli officials have insisted that Israel has the ability and the right to resolve matters through an internal investigation and does not require international oversight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Selebi was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/interpol-ex-president-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with receiving $170,000 in bribes from convicted drug smuggler <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-06-02-selebis-friend-the-fraud">Glenn Agliotti</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], who was suspected of killing South African mining magnate Brett Kebble.

The court rejected Selebi's defense of a conspiracy against him and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/10485558.stm">found him guilty of granting favors</a> [BBC report] to Agliotti in exchange for money and gifts totaling USD $156,000.

Selebi is scheduled to be sentenced on July 14. He could face up to 15 years in prison. 

<p>Selebi was a close political ally of former South African president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/249680.stm">Thabo Mbeki</a> [BBC profile], and the South African government <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7475254.stm">extended</a> [BBC report] Selebi's contract for an additional year in June 2008, around the time a court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/south-africa-police-commissioner.php">established</a> [JURIST report] Selebi's trial date.

Videla was tried and convicted in 1985 along with eight other <em>junta</em> leaders on abduction, torture and murder charges, but was pardoned in 1990 by former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1376100.stm">Carlos Menem</a> [BBC profile]. In 2006, a federal judge ruled that the presidential pardon was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/argentina-judge-rules-dirty-war-pardon.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], allowing criminal charges to be brought against the former dictator. Videla, who is now 84, is also facing charges in <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/italy-seeks-extradition-of-139-in-south.php">Italy</a>, Spain, France and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dnp-videla.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports] involving the deaths of their citizens during the Dirty War.

Videla has been in prison since 2008 while an investigation is underway for his role in the abduction of children born to political prisoners and forced disappearance victims during Argentina's Dirty War. A court revoked the house arrest conditions he had been granted in 1998 when the investigation began. Despite his age, Videla is now being held in a common cell in Cordoba. During the period Videla was head of the military junta, an estimated 90,000 civilians were killed or disappeared.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the <a href="http://mayor.cityofchicago.org/mayor/en/press_room/press_releases/2010/july_2010/0701_supreme_ct_gun.html">new ordinance</a> [press release], citizens possessing handguns must keep them inside their homes. The gun owners are not permitted to take their guns into the yard, garage or porch of the home. Additional requirements were also placed on handgun registration. Adults who are legally permitted to own handguns may register one handgun a month and the registration must be renewed every three years. The legislation was enacted four days after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1521">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] right to bear arms is applicable to the states as well as the federal government. The court remanded <u>McDonald</u>  to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website], where they are expected to rule that Chicago's <a href="http://www.isp.state.il.us/docs/ordinances/chicago.pdf">current handgun ban</a> [ordinance, PDF] is unconstitutional because it prohibits citizens from keeping handguns in their homes for protection. Chicago <a href="http://mayor.cityofchicago.org/mayor/en.html">Mayor Richard Daly</a> [official website] spoke about the need for the new ordinance on Thursday and called for the city council to act quickly in order to pass restrictions that were within the constitutional limits described by the court in <u>McDonald</u>. The ordinance is scheduled to go into effect on July 12, although lawsuits challenging its validity are expected.

<p>The court's ruling in <u>McDonald</u> cited the holding in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>] where the court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense. The District of Columbia enacted a new series of firearm regulations following the court's ruling in <u>Heller</u>. The regulations were <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">recently upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">report</a>] by a federal judge who cited <u>Heller</u>, holding that the Second Amendment does not prohibit regulation of firearms where that regulation will "effectuate the goal of promoting public safety." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A federal judge on Thursday ruled that former Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/ahmed_khalfan_ghailani.htm">Ahmed Ghailani</a> [GlobalSecurity profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ghailani">news archive</a>] is not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and is therefore fit to stand trial. The issue of Ghailani's psychological state arose after he <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-subject-to-strip-search.php">requested to be exempt</a> [JURIST report] from prison strip searches because it triggers his PTSD, which he allegedly acquired while being interrogated at an overseas <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] detention camp. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] denied the request, but decided to further investigate Ghailani's PTSD claims. Kaplan concluded that the reason Ghailani has skipped hearings in the case is an effort to frustrate the prosecution rather than the consequence of psychological trauma from strip searches. Kaplan also stated that Ghailani is capable of standing trial and is of the mind to adequately defend himself. 

<p>The exemption request was filed in May after Kaplan ruled that Ghailani must <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-to-attend-trial-despite-strip-searches.php">attend the opening of his trial</a> [JURIST report], requiring him to submit to strip searches. Kaplan held that the entire visual search was a necessary safety standard to prevent inmates from hiding weapons and other illegal items in body cavities. Last month, Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-drop-charges-against-exguantanamo-detainee.php">refused to dismiss criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ghailani, despite his lawyer's claims that he had been tortured in prison. Kaplan held that even if Ghailani were mistreated while in CIA custody, there was no connection between that and the current prosecution. In November, Kaplan ruled that Ghailani does <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-against-military.php">not have a right to be represented by his military defense lawyers</a> [JURIST report] in a civilian court. In July 2009, Ghailani's military lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-request.php">requested access</a> [JURIST report] to the CIA "black sites" at which their client was held prior to his transfer to Guantanamo Bay and was allegedly subjected to cruel interrogation methods. Ghailani was the first Guantanamo detainee to be brought to the US for prosecution. Having been held at the Guantanamo facility since 2006, Ghailani was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to-us.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the SDNY in June to face 286 separate counts, including involvement in the bombings and conspiring with Osama bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda to kill Americans worldwide. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-ex-detainee-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] at his initial appearance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the new legislation, sanctions will be imposed against parties investing in Iran's petroleum development and aiding in exporting the petroleum. Financial institutions that facilitate certain activities in Iran, including the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/qods.htm">Islamic Revolutionary Guard</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], will also be subject to sanctions. The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] voted last month to impose a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34970&Cr=&Cr1=">fourth round of sanctions on Iran</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran.php">report</a>] in order to persuade the country to cease their enrichment procedures and resolve international concerns over their nuclear program. Obama indicated that the legislation <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-hr-2194">"builds on"</a> [press release] the UN sanctions and called the sanctions "a powerful tool against Iran's development of nuclear weapons and support of terrorism." 

<p>Iranian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4107270.stm">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahmadinejad">news archive</a>] has strongly criticized attempts to impose UN sanctions on his country's nuclear program. Last month, the Iranian leader said that actions being taken by the US and its allies in the Security Council are illegal and that his country will not accept any pressure. He also said that any evidence submitted by the US and Britain for new UN sanctions amounted to "lies" similar to the claims made over nuclear weapons in Iraq which served as an impetus to the 2003 war. In December 2006, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-security-council-imposes-nuclear.php">imposed sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium and <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/security-council-broadens-iran-nuclear.php">broadened them</a> [JURIST report] three months later. The UN had previously ordered Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/breaking-news-un-security-council.php">stop expanding</a> [JURIST report] its nuclear program by August 31, 2006. Iran has said it will <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-threatens-iaea-withdrawal-if.php">completely withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the IAEA if its "nuclear rights" are taken away.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Zentai is accused of killing Jewish teenager Peter Balazs in 1944 in Budapest for failing to wear the Star of David identifying him as a Jew. Judge Neil McKerracher overturned an extradition order made last year by Australian <a href="http://www.brendanoconnor.com.au/">Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor</a> [official website], holding that the case had no jurisdictional precedent. He directed the government to explore other options besides extraditing Zentai, such as trying him in a domestic court. McKerracher also said it was inhumane to send Zentai, now in his 80s, back to Hungary due to his age and poor health. The extradition proceedings were initiated by the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/">Simon Wiesenthal Center </a> [official website], an international Jewish human rights organization dedicated to locating former Nazi war criminals. The center, which has identified Zentai on its top ten most wanted list, <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441467&ct=8493319">strongly criticized the ruling</a> [press release] stating that: <blockquote>Today is a very sad day for Australia, Australian justice, and especially for the Balazs family and for people seeking justice for the victims of the Holocaust. If anything, the Zentai case shows a lack of understanding by the Australian judicial system of the urgency and importance of bringing suspected Holocaust criminals to justice. Contrary to today's decision, Zentai's age is totally irrelevant...and the notion that he would be treated harshly in Hungary, a member in good standing of the [EU] and NATO is ludicrous. We urge the Hungarian and Australian authorities to take all possible measures to overturn today's unfortunate decision.</blockquote> Zentai denies the allegations against him and claims that he was not in Budapest at the time of the alleged offense. It is not yet known whether the Australian government will appeal the decision. 

<p>Several suspected Nazi collaborators have recently faced deportation to stand trial for war crimes committed during World War II. In May this year a US immigration court ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-immigration-court-orders-deportation-of-ex-nazi-guard-to-austria.php">deportation of former SS guard Anton Geiser</a> [JURIST report] to Austria for serving as an armed guard at the Sachsenhausen and the Buchenwald concentration camps during World War II. Earlier that month accused Nazi prison guard <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/accused-nazi-guard-deported-to-germany.php">deported</a> to Germany after <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">exhausting the US appeals process</a> [JURIST report] all the way to the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>].

The ECJ also called for improvements at the workplace for the safety and health of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. The suits were filed by Austrian doctor Susanne Gassmayr and Finnish airline flight attendant Sanna Maria Parviainen, who both suffered losses at work after becoming pregnant. Gassamayr lost on-call duty allowances and Parviainen lost allowances after being transferred to ground staff. The ECJ's ruling is binding on all EU member nations. 

<p>The ECJ was created to ensure that EU legislation is interpreted and applied in the same way in all EU countries and that national courts do not give different rulings on the same issue. Last month the ECJ ruled that Dutch restrictions on Internet gambling were compatible with <a target="_blank" href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/services/docs/infringements/art49_en.pdf">EU law on service provisions and games of chance</a> [Article 49-EC text, PDF], holding that that national regulations on <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/eu-court-upholds-dutch-gambling-restrictions.php">games of chance are compatible with EU law</a> [JURIST report] when they are enacted to mitigate addiction and combat fraud. The ECJ ruled in April that the UK <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/europe-court-rules-uk-may-not-suspend.php">may not restrict government benefits</a> [JURIST report] to the spouses and families of suspected terrorists. The court struck down the UK's interpretation of EU law, finding that it does not fulfill the purpose of combating international terrorism. In November the ECJ ruled that airline passengers confronted with flight delays of two hours or more may receive compensation equal to that of passengers whose flights are canceled. The case arose under European Parliament and European Council <a target="_blank" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0261:EN:HTML:NOT">Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004</a> [text, PDF], which sets rules for compensation and assistance of airline passengers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law, set to take effect July 5, replaces the current law dating back to 1985, which allowed abortions only in the case of rape, up to 12 weeks, severe fetal malformation, up to 22 weeks, or if the woman's physical or mental health was in danger.  The protest follows similar demonstrations in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thousands-protest-spain-abortion-law.php">March</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-protesters-oppose-relaxation-of.php">last October</a> [JURIST reports].

The Spanish <a href="http://www.senado.es/index.html"></a>Senate</a> [official website, in Spanish] gave final approval to the bill in February.

Specific changes would remove the DOI's ability to override vetoes of the American Samoan governor and remove its ability to reject amendments to the constitution. Delegates <a href="http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54365">rejected a proposal</a> [RNZI report] to transfer the authority to appoint members to the High Court from the DOI to the governor, however. The proposed constitutional changes would additionally create a right to jury trials and set the number of representatives in the territorial legislature, known as the <a href="http://americansamoa.gov/forum/topic/american-samoa-fono">Fono</a> [official website]. The American Samoan government would also have the right to <a href="http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54496">opt out of federal laws</a> [RNZI report] deemed harmful to the territory and would be allowed to require that all <a href="http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=16661">members of the Fono be of Samoan ancestry</a> [<em>Samoa News</em> report]. American Samoa's non-voting delegate to the US Congress, <a href="http://www.house.gov/faleomavaega/">Eni Faleomavaega</a> (D) [official website] opposed both proposals, describing them as unconstitutional under the US constitution. The changes will be put to American Samoan voters in November, and must also be approved by the DOI and Congress before taking effect.

<p>The constitutional convention was <a href="http://americansamoa.gov/sites/default/files/concon/exec-order-calling-concon.pdf">called</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="http://americansamoa.gov/governor">Governor Togiola Tulafono</a> (D) [official website] earlier this month. Also in June, Faleomavaega <a href="http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54201">called for a referendum</a> on the political status of the territory, echoing a statement by Tulafono calling for <a href="http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=54058">greater autonomy for the territory</a> [RNZI reports]. In explaining the need for greater local governance, Tulafono expressed the worry that local laws favoring those of Samoan decent may come to be challenged in the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] and cited the harmful effects of federal minimum wage laws that were applied to the territory in 2007. American Samoa has been a US territory since 1900, when the leaders of the three islands that comprise the unorganized and unincorporated south Pacific territory signed the <a href="http://americansamoa.gov/sites/default/files/concon/Historical%20Documents%20and%20Constitutions.pdf">Deeds of Cession</a> [text, PDF]. The nearly 70,000 residents of the territory are US nationals, a status that is not recognized as US citizenship, and remain exempt from most federal laws and provisions of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge panel overturned the district court ruling, which held that Bensaya's imprisonment by the US government was legal because evidence showed he was an al Qaeda supporter and that it was unnecessary to determine if the government could also prove that he was part of al Qaeda. Circuit Judge Douglas Ginsburg, writing the opinion for the panel, held that there appeared to be no direct evidence linking Bensaya to al Qaeda, and that the government's authority under the 2001 <a target="_blank" href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF] only extends to the detention of individuals who are "functionally part of" a terrorist organization. Ginsburg also stated that "the evidence upon which the district court relied in concluding Bensayah 'supported' Al-Qaeda is insufficient...to show he was part of that organization." If the government, upon remand to the district court, cannot provide a preponderance of evidence that Bensaya was part of al-Qaeda, then his indefinite detention would be deemed illegal under AUMF and he should be granted <em>habeas corpus</em> relief.  Bensaya was captured in Bosnia in 2001 along with five other Bosnian-Algerian nationals. The men were accused of planning to travel to Afghanistan to fight against US forces and were sent to Guantanamo Bay in January 2002.

<p>Bensayah was the only one of the six petitioners from the 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] decision who was not granted <em>habeas</em> relief after the Supreme Court remanded the case for further review of evidence. Under <u>Boumediene</u> federal courts have jurisdiction to review <i>habeas corpus</i> petitions filed by Guantanamo detainees who have been classified as "enemy combatants." In May the DC Circuit ruled in <em>Al Maqaleh v. Gates</em> that  <u>Boumediene</u> was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">narrowly tailored to detainees being held at Guantanamo</a> and that detainees held at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Force Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a target="_blank" href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">news archive</a>] in Afghanistan cannot bring <i>habeas corpus</i> challenges in US courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 78-year old former judge was put on trial in October 2009 sparking criticism from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-detention-haitham-maleh">US government</a> [press release] and several human rights groups. In June the US government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65N6NL20100624">reiterated its disapproval</a> [Reuters report] of Syria's increased crackdown on political dissidents and called for the release of several political prisoners, including Maleh. Lawyers for Maleh called the judgment "tragic" and fear that due to his age and poor health he will not survive his sentence. Maleh was held as a political prisoner for six years in the 1980s and was banned from leaving Syria. In 2006 he was awarded the Dutch Geuzen Medal, which is named after the Nazi resistance fighters, for serving as a political activist over the past several decades.

<p>Over the past several years, Syria has increased its prosecution of political dissidents, drawing strong criticism from the international community. In October 2008 a Damascus criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/syria-court-sentences-dissidents.php">sentenced twelve dissidents</a> [JURIST report] accused of inciting sectarian strife to two and a half years in prison.

In January 2008 the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/syria-arrests-pro-democracy-former.php">Syrian government arrested</a> [JURIST report] former parliamentarian and dissident Riyad Sayf, a prominent member of the "Damascus Declaration" group which in 2005 issued a declaration urging Syria to embark on democratic transition and improve relations with Lebanon. In 2007 a Syrian court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/syria-court-sentences-dissidents-for.php">sentenced writer and activist Michel Kilo</a> [JURIST report] to a prison term of three years for "speaking false news, weakening national feeling and inciting sectarian sentiments." Kilo was arrested in May 2005 along with nine other Syrians shortly after signing the so-called Beirut-Damascus Declaration of 12 May, which calls for the normalization of relations between Syria and Lebanon, a properly demarcated border, the release of political prisoners, and an exchange of ambassadors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOE filed a <a href="http://www.energy.gov/news/documents/DOE_Motion_to_Withdraw.pdf">motion to withdraw the application</a> [text, PDF] in March claiming that Yucca Mountain is not a "workable option" for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste and that "alternatives will better serve the public interest." Under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/nwpa82.pdf">Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982</a> [text, PDF] the NRC regulates the terms and conditions of a withdrawal of an application. The three-judge panel ruled last week that the executive branch could not act unilaterally to withdrawal the application, and the request must instead be initiated by an act of Congress. Explaining its ruling the panel stated: <blockquote>Unless Congress directs otherwise, DOE may not single-handedly derail the legislated decision-making process by withdrawing the [Yucca Mountain repository] application. Given the stated purposes of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and the detailed structure of that legislation, it would be illogical to allow DOE to withdraw the application without any examination of the merits...[The Act] does not give the [DOE] secretary the discretion to substitute his policy for the one established by Congress. </blockquote> The judges also added the the DOE had weakened its arguments by "conceding that the application is not flawed nor the site unsafe." The NRC already granted an appeal of the ruling and set a July 16 deadline for follow up briefs. If the NRC rules against the DOE, the department can appeal to the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website].

<p>The nuclear repository has not been welcomed by Nevada government officials, who have been mounting challenges against the site since Congress approved government plans to construct the facility in 2002. Government officials fear that the repository, which will be located 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, will negatively effect the city's $28 billion tourism industry. Rejecting challenges by Nevada officials, the DC Circuit ruled in 2004 that federal plans to build a nuclear waste site in the state were <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/appeals-court-rules-yucca-mountain.htm">constitutional under the Takings Clause</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2006 Nevada filed a lawsuit against the federal government, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/nevada-sues-us-government-to-gain.php">seeking documents related to the repository</a> [JURIST report], including documents which allegedly contain information that the proposed site cannot meet <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/epa-puts-forward-new-radiation.php">radiation safety standards</a> [JURIST report] mandated by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website]. Later that year Nevada filed suit in the DC Circuit Court challenging the DOE's Record of Decision (ROD) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) governing the transportation of waste to Yucca Mountain, alleging that both violated the National Environmental Policy Act. The court declined to review a DOE proposal to move nuclear waste to the repository by rail, finding that some <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-nevada.php">claims by Nevada lacked merit</a> [JURIST report] while others were unripe. The application for the repository has been pending since 2008 when it was filed by former president George W. Bush. The repository was approved by Congress in 1987 to contain highly toxic waste from nuclear complexes that built atomic bombs during the Cold War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Xue was also fined 200,000 yuan. The court stated that Xue received a database which contained the coordinates for oil wells owned by the <a href="http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/">China National Petroleum Corporation</a> [official website] while conducting research for US-based IHS energy. Upon discovery, Xue <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gE6zSxI_SVZeYhKBsZD4BN2K34HAD9GOV4J00">agreed to sell the database to IHS</a> [AP report], which the court ruled was illegal under China's controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+state+secrets">state secrets</a> [JURIST news archive] law.

Xue was arrested over two and a half years ago and was allegedly tortured during his incarceration.

Ganic, who served as vice president during the outset of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">1992-1995 Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive], is accused of ordering attacks in Sarajevo during the start of the war in violation of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/y3gctpw.htm">Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</a> [text].

The court held that Khadr, who is a Canadian citizen, has a right to "procedural fairness and natural justice" under  <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], and the government has so far failed to take appropriate action to guarantee these rights. The court also ruled that Khadr is entitled to submit additional potential remedies and will provide his list to the government within seven days of their original submission. Judge Russell Zinn, delivering the judgment of the court, held that upon receiving the remedies list, the government must "advance a potential curative remedy as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable and to continue advancing potential curative remedies until the breach has been cured or all such potential curative remedies have been exhausted." Zinn concluded that he retained jurisdiction to impose a remedy if the government does not implement an effective remedy withing a "reasonably practicable period of time."  Khadr has been held at Guantanamo since his 2002 capture by US forces in Afghanistan when he was 15 years old. He is facing <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed one US soldier and injured another. He has repeatedly denied the accusation.

<p>Khadr <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">sought judicial review</a> from the Federal Court following the Supreme Court's decision in January that Canada would continue to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">refuse to request his repatriation</a> [JURIST reports] from Guantanamo, even though the judges unanimously agreed that the government had breached Khadr's Charter rights. According to the ruling, Canadian officials questioned Khadr, who was captured at age 15, even though they knew he was being indefinitely detained, and, in March 2004, he was questioned with knowledge that he was subjected to three weeks sleep deprivation by US authorities. In May, a UN official called on the US and Canada to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-calls-for-khadrs-release-to-canada.php">respect international conventions</a> [JURIST report] and release Khadr into Canadian custody. The UN claimed that since Khadr was 15 when he was captured, his detention would fall in line with the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [official website], which has been ratified by Canada, but not the US. Khadr's trial before a US military commission is <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-judge-sets-opening-date-for-khadr-trial.php">set to begin on August 10</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thai <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website, in Thai] said the decision was <a href="http://www.mcot.net/cfcustom/cache_page/75287.html">based on intelligence reports</a> [MCOT report] regarding certain areas of the country and also noted that the state of emergency would be allowed to expire in five provinces that are considered to be stable. The state of emergency was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared in April</a> [JURIST report] after protesters, known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], broke into Parliament, causing government officials to evacuate. Rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-fears-ill-treatment-of-imprisoned-thai-protesters.php">expressed concern</a> about the treatment of anti-government protesters arrested during the protests and urged the government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/asia-rights-groups-urge-thailand-to-end-state-of-emergency.php">end the state of emergency</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/">International Crisis Group</a> (ICG) [advocacy website] on Monday released a report <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/asia/south-east-asia/thailand/192_Bridging%20Thailands%20Deep%20Divide.ashx">detailing reconciliation efforts in Thailand</a> [report, PDF] following the protests. In the report, they called for an immediate end to the state of emergency, which they say has <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/media-releases/2010/asia/bridging-thailands-deep-divide.aspx">"empowed" the government to stifle political discourse</a> [press release] within the country. Thailand's Human Rights Commissioner Nirand Pithakwachara has expressed concern over the extension, calling on the government to clarify the reason for extending the state of emergency and noting that the extension was not consistent with the steps the government has been taking toward reconciliation. Under the state of emergency, civil liberties will continue to be restricted through the institution of curfews and the banning of public gatherings. Additionally, the police have broader powers to arrest and detain, the government may censor media reports and detainees can be held for 30 days without access to legal counsel. Abhisit first <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/thailand-grants-bail-to-red-shirt-protesters-extends-state-of-emergency.php">extended the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] last month, but he had indicated at that time that the state of emergency would be allowed to expire on July 7.

<p>The protests <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-government-imposes-curfew-in-bangkok.php">came to an end</a> [JURIST report] in May when red shirt leaders surrendered to police, which led to rioting, arson and the imposition of a curfew to protect citizens of Bangkok and its surrounding areas. The red shirts are supporters of ousted prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from power in 2006</a> [JURIST report]. The group was demanding that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call new elections. Last month, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/thailand-court-charges-11-red-shirt-protest-leaders-with-terrorism.php">charged 11 protest leaders</a> [JURIST report] with terrorism in connection with the political demonstrations. In May, 27 red shirt protesters were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/thailand-court-sentences-protesters-to-six-months-in-prison.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] for violating the emergency decree prohibiting political gatherings of more than five people.

Police officials stated that the ACC filed suit against  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6430063.stm">Tarique Rahman</a> [BBC profile] and his business partner Giasuddin Al Mamun in October, but <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100706/wl_sthasia_afp/bangladeshpoliticscorruption">officially filed the corruption charges</a> [AP report] on Tuesday after investigation into the claims. The money was allegedly laundered between 2003 and 2007. Tarique was detained by the military-backed government in 2007 but was released from prison amidst torture allegations. He now lives in London with Zia in order to receive medical treatment. Mamun is currently incarcerated in Bangladesh and facing additional corruption charges.

<p>Tarique and Zia are also <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/bangladesh-ex-pm-zia-facing-october.php">facing charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report] filed by the ACC in August. Zia, the head of the opposition <a href="http://www.bnpbd.com/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> [party website], her son and four others are accused of embezzling over 21 million taka (US $305,000) in the Zia Orphanage Trust, which is said to be nonexistent. In May 2009, Morshed Khan, who served as Zia's foreign minister, began <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/bangladesh-foreign-minister-begins-13.php">serving a 13-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] for illegally amassing nearly $250,000. Khan initially fled the country following the January 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bangladesh-president-declares-state-of.php">state of emergency declaration</a> [JURIST report] that suspended democratic rights in Bangladesh. Three other Zia officials were <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/bangladesh-court-jails-former-cabinet.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] in November 2008. Zia herself was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/ex-bangladesh-pm-zia-charged-with.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of corruption in September 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protesters, led by Sri Lankan cabinet member Wimal Weerawansa, demonstrated outside UN offices in the country's capital, preventing UN workers from leaving the building and warning that the workers would not be permitted to leave until the panel is disbanded. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] appointed the panel last month to investigate alleged wartime abuses of civilians by both the Sri Lankan government and the rebel <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] in the hopes that the Sri Lankan government will hold those responsible for the worst of the violence <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4627">accountable</a> [statement] for their actions. Police at one point attempted to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ij-D67fEIY_lCaAalIujISmZREfQD9GPIEF00">disperse the protesters</a> [AP report], but allowed the protests to continue after Weerawansa ordered the police to stop the dispersal. The protesters indicated that they believed the UN panel was <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/07/20107674337668209.html">put in place</a> [Al Jazeera report] to facilitate war crimes charges against members of the Sri Lankan military who they say acted admirably in fighting terrorism within the country. The government has <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-rejects-un-panel-investigating-possible-civil-war-rights-abuses.php">rejected implementation</a> of the panel and indicated it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">refuse entry</a> [JURIST reports] to its members. They view the panel as a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty and have cited an internal commission <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca201005/20100517president_appoints_lessons_learnt_reconciliation_commission.htm">appointed in May</a> [press release] as sufficient to deal with reconciliation issues related to the violence within Sri Lanka. 

<p>Sri Lanka has faced numerous allegations of human rights violations originating from incidents that took place during the final months of the civil war. In May, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] announced it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-claims-to-have-new-evidence-of-sri-lanka-wartime-abuses.php">acquired new evidence</a> [JURIST report] supporting allegations of war crimes. Also in May, the <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/">International Crisis Group</a> (ICG) [official website] accused Sri Lankan security forces of <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/report-reveals-porential-war-crimes-by-sri-lanka-security-forces.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report], claiming that the violence of the 30-year civil war escalated in January 2009, leaving thousands more dead than projected by the UN. The UN panel has been asked to examine "the modalities, applicable international standards and comparative experience with regard to accountability processes, taking into account the nature and scope of any alleged violations in Sri Lanka" and make the information available to the Sri Lankan government for further action on the matter. The panel will also report on the implementation of the human rights <a href="http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090524_02">accountability statement</a> [text] that both Ban and Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/mahinda_rajapaksa.asp">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] agreed to last May, but which Rajapaksa <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sri-lanka-president-rejects-full-access.php">subsequently rejected</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Details as to why the court decided to reopen the investigation are not yet available. The Spanish <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?id=342">National Court</a> [CJA backgrounder] in November dismissed charges against three US soldiers who were accused of being involved in Couso's death and recommended the case be closed because no new evidence had been produced since <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=pedraz">Judge Santiago Pedraz Gomez</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/05/spain-judge-reinstates-charges-against.php">reinstated the charges</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009. Homicide charges filed against Sgt. Shawn Gibson, Capt. Philip Wolford and Lt. Col. Philip DeCamp were initially dropped in 2007 due to a lack of evidence.

The announcement was made following an <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-government-to-form-task-force-to.php">independent Israeli investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the conflict, as well as the allegations contained in the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf">Goldstone report</a> [text, PDF]. The Goldstone report was the result of a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] fact-finding mission, which accused both IDF and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hamas.htm">Hamas</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] fighters of war crimes during the conflict. According to the IDF, more than 150 incidents were investigated, with action being taken against four soldiers. Three soldiers face disciplinary hearings for their actions and one will face criminal manslaughter charges for allegedly firing into a crowd of civilians who were waving a white flag. The other charges include allegations that civilians were used as human shields and that an air strike was ordered for an area close to a mosque. A criminal investigation has also been ordered into the bombing of a civilian housing complex. The IDF noted that further legal measures would not be taken in other incidents mentioned by the Goldstone report because, "according to the rules of warfare, no faults were found in the forces' actions" or there was not enough evidence to proceed. The IDF also reiterated that the operation was conducted after eight years of rocket fire into southern Israel from Gaza and that Israel practiced a "policy of restraint for a long period of time." 

<p>Both Israel and Hamas conducted independent investigations into the incident after the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] adopted a resolution in November giving them three months to probe possible war crimes committed during the Gaza conflict. Hamas reported to the UN that its independent investigation had absolved Palestinian forces of any wrongdoing. Israel presented a report to the UN in February <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-military-officials-disciplined.php">detailing its role in the conflict</a> [JURIST report] and noting that two high-ranking Israeli officers were indicted for their actions during the incident. Rights groups have questioned the impartiality of the internal investigations. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/israel-hamas-failed-to-conduct-credible.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] both Israel and Hamas of failing to conduct meaningful, credible investigations into accusations of war crimes during the conflict. In February, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-probe-of-gaza-fighting-not.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Israel for failing to demonstrate that it would conduct a thorough and impartial investigation of the alleged war crimes. Just prior to that, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-chief-unsure-whether-israel.php">said that it was unclear</a> whether Israel and Palestine have <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">fully met UN demands</a> [JURIST reports] to set up a commission to investigate war crimes that may occurred during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The inquiry comes after 12 ex-detainees brought civil cases against the government, claiming that British agents took part in their mistreatment while they were held in prisons in foreign countries, including Pakistan and Morocco. The UK will ask the ex-detainees to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j536v6m_aIZbuEF2Ntf8mDy2hnUAD9GPLFS80">drop their lawsuits</a> [AP report] in exchange for possible compensation and a promise that the inquiry will fully investigate their claims. Cameron said that he hopes to start the investigation by the end of the year, once a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uk-court-rules-evidence-may-be-kept.php">separate investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of MI5 and MI6 agents at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] concludes, and to have a full report back within the next 12 months. Cameron named former judge <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page18892">Peter Gibson</a> [press release], who is currently serving as the nation's Intelligence Services Commissioner, to lead the three-member panel. Gibson, the former Lord Justice of Appeal and Chairman of the Law Commission, is in his second term as Intelligence Services Commissioner, whose job is to review actions taken by the Secretary of State and by British intelligence under the <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1426823">Intelligence Services Act of 1994</a> [text]. He has yet to determine whether parts of the investigation can be held publicly.

<p>The British government indicated last week that it will issue a new set of regulations regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">use of information obtained via torture</a> [JURIST report]. The announcement came as part of the government's defense against a lawsuit filed by the human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], which has been seeking a review of the country's torture policy. A UK High Court judge agreed that the country's <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2010_06_28_torture_policy_litigation_hearing">policy must be reviewed</a> [press release], but indicated that because lawyers for the government promised new guidelines would be released shortly, the court would take no immediate action. Similar claims of complicity were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">new report</a> [materials] released last week by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. According to HRW, intelligence services in France, Germany and the UK lack proper oversight of intelligence information that is received from countries that torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website] for leaking a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYTxuW2vmzk">controversial classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq and classified <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] documents. Manning <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/2010/Manning-charge-sheet.pdf">faces two charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF] under the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text] for the transfer of classified information and exceeding his authorized computer access. Manning was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/world/08leaks.html">detained in Kuwait</a> [NYT report] in May after releasing the video, entitled "Collateral Murder," on <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website]. The video was recorded in July 2007 by a US Apache helicopter gun-sight camera and shows several civilians, including two Reuters journalists, being gunned down by the helicopter in Baghdad, Iraq. Manning is also accused of releasing more than 150,000 classified State Department cables and a PowerPoint presentation. Wikileaks does not ask sources to identify themselves, but Manning was reported to authorities by former hacker Andrian Lamo, who learned of the leaks after forming an online friendship with the soldier. Due to the gravity of the charges, Manning's investigation could lead to a court-martial. 

<p>The prosecution of Manning has sparked heated debate between defenders and critics. Those who support Manning's actions Manning refer to him as <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/manning1/petition.html">courageous for acting as a whistleblower</a> [advocacy petition] against government crime and corruption. He has been compared to famous US whistleblowers such as <a href="http://www.frankserpico.com/">Frank Serpico</a> and <a href="http://www.ellsberg.net/">Daniel Ellsberg</a> [personal websites], who leaked information regarding corruption in the New York Police Department and the Pentagon, respectively. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895204575321080522272718.html">criticized the video</a> [WSJ report], claiming it provides the public a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw." He noted that public attention was not drawn to what was discovered by US ground forces following the helicopter gunfire, including AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. He also defended the reality of fighting terrorist organizations, which is made up of combatants who do not wear enemy uniforms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DOJ-AZ-complaint-7-6-10.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DOJ-AZ-brief-7-6-10.pdf">supporting brief</a>, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's controversial new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The DOJ argues that the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The agency also claims that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy. <blockquote>S.B. 1070 pursues only one goal - "attrition" - and ignores the many other objectives that Congress has established for the federal immigration system. And even in pursuing attrition, S.B. 1070 disrupts federal enforcement priorities and resources that focus on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety. If allowed to go into effect, S.B. 1070's mandatory enforcement scheme will conflict with and undermine the federal government&#8217;s careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities and objectives. For example, it will impose significant and counterproductive burdens on the federal agencies charged with enforcing the national immigration scheme, diverting resources and attention from the dangerous aliens who the federal government targets as its top enforcement priority. It will cause the detention and harassment of authorized visitors, immigrants, and citizens who do not have or carry identification documents specified by the statute, or who otherwise will be swept into the ambit of S.B. 1070's "attrition through enforcement" approach. ... And it will interfere with vital foreign policy and national security interests by disrupting the United States' relationship with Mexico and other countries.</blockquote>The suit was filed against the State of Arizona and <a target="_blank" href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website], who previously responded to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/obama-administration-to-file-lawsuit-challenging-arizona-immigration-law.php">reports of a federal legal action</a> [JURIST report] saying that the lawsuit would be "outrageous" and a waste of federal funds that would be better spent on national immigration reform. The legislation was  <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Brewer in April and is set to take effect July 29.

<p>The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling. Last week, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-brief-against-arizona-immigrations-law.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the federal district court in Arizona to block the enforcement of the state's immigration law. The brief was filed in support of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The Mexican government has also filed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mexico-asks-judge-to-strike-down-arizona-immigration-law.php"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] supporting the ACLU suit, claiming a substantial interest in ensuring its "bilateral diplomatic relations" with the US remain "transparent, consistent and reliable, and not frustrated by the actions of individual US states." The government also claims an interest in ensuring that its citizens are "accorded human and civil rights when present in the US in accordance with federal immigration law." Brewer is also currently facing federal lawsuits filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration-law.php">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> and several <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Tuscon police officers</a> [JURIST reports], who claim they can not properly implement the law without racially profiling. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Transport Rule targets power plants specifically as a cost-effective way to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions&#8212;gases that react to form pollution and smog. The EPA is focusing on reducing these emissions in 31 states, mainly located in the eastern part of the country, and anticipates this approach will reduce interstate transport of air pollution in compliance with the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Clean+Air+Act">news archive</a>]. The agency estimates the rule could provide more than $120 billion in health care benefits by 2014 and avoid thousands of cases of premature deaths, heart attacks, aggravated asthma and acute bronchitis. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said that the Transport Rule is meant to be preemptive:<blockquote>This rule is designed to cut pollution that spreads hundreds of miles and has enormous negative impacts on millions of Americans.  We're working to limit pollution at its source, rather than waiting for it to move across the country.  The reductions we're proposing will save billions in health costs, help increase American educational and economic productivity and -- most importantly -- save lives.</blockquote>The EPA estimates the proposed rule will have a minimal impact on the cost of electricity and will reduce emissions by more than 50 percent of the 2005 levels. The Transport Rule will replace the 2005 <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cair/">Clean Air Interstate Rule</a> (CAIR) [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/epa-finalizes-new-rule-on-air.php">report</a>], which the EPA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-clean-air.php">directed to replace</a> [JURIST report] in 2008. <a href="http://carper.senate.gov/">Senator Tom Carper</a> (D-DE) [official website] concluded that the new rule will <a href="http://carper.senate.gov/press/record.cfm?id=326201">produce cleaner air</a> [press release], but found it to be "complicated and open to further lawsuits." He called on Congress to pass legislation to address clean air issues.

<p>The CAIR was rejected by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cadc.uscourts.gov%2F&ei=JmE0TP_8E4T78AaQ2pjJCw&usg=AFQjCNGf2BFFZjqVBePtSspgEHgkfodP3g&sig2=-Yz4qhhuBKW7swcZMFEtDQ">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in 2008. The court found the rule's proposal to permanently cap emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to be "fundamentally flawed." The EPA's announcement comes just weeks after the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">defeated a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to limit the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Supporters of the resolution contended that Congress should have the power to regulate emissions and that EPA regulations could potentially harm the economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noriega, whose <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/noriega-money-laundering-trial-begins-in-france.php">trial began last week</a> [JURIST report], was convicted of laundering $3 million in drug profits by purchasing property in Paris. A lawyer for Noriega stated that the former dictator would receive credit for the 32 months he served in a US prison while fighting his extradition to France and will also be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/07/07/france.noriega.trial/?hpt=T2">eligible for parole</a> [CNN report] halfway through his sentence. Noriega was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] to France in April by the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. Noriega was already <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced <em>in absentia</em></a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but was entitled to a new trial under French law. 

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca-paris.justice.fr/">Paris Court of Appeals</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/france-appeals-court-denies-Noriega-bail-request.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by Noriega to be released from jail while awaiting his trial. Noriega claimed that he is too well-known to be a flight risk and that because of his partial paralysis and poor health, he was not receiving adequate care in Paris's La Sante prison. The court rejected his appeal, remanding him to custody. In April, the French Justice Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-justice-ministry-rejects-noriega.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Noriega's request to be treated as a prisoner of war (POW). Justice Ministry spokesperson Guillaume Didier said that Noriega would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gODl19SGLO7Ov9_Wu46K03st3jCg">not be treated as a POW</a> [AFP report] because the charges are based on breaches of common law not related to military service. Earlier that week, Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said that his government would seek Noriega's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">extradition</a>  [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama. Noriega had <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. In March, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega's petition to stop the extradition process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bethune was convicted of assault, trespass, destruction of property, illegal possession of a weapon and obstruction of business. He had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/japan-court-begins-trial-of-anti-whaling-activist.php">made an admission of guilt</a> [JURIST report] to all charges except assault when his trial began in May. The assault conviction stemmed from allegations that Bethune threw cartons of rancid butter at the vessel and injured a Japanese crewman in the process. Bethune was sentenced to two years, but the court suspended the sentence for five years, meaning that Bethune will not serve jail time unless he returns to Japan. He will be deported to New Zealand on July 9.

<p>Bethune's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/japan-authorities-indict-new-zealand.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] stem from boarding the Shanon Maru II, a Japanese whaling vessel, in response to a January 6 collision with the anti-whaling vessel, the Ady Gil, which he captained. As a result of the collision, the bow of the Ady Gil was sheared off, and the crew was rescued by another ship. On February 15, Bethune allegedly approached the Shanon Maru II ship on a jet ski, cut through anti-boarding netting surrounding the ship, boarded the ship and then presented its captain with a bill for $3 million in damage done to his ship. He was taken into custody and sent to Tokyo where he was arrested by the Japanese Coast Guard. Commercial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=whaling">whaling</a> [JURIST news archive] was banned by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/">International Whaling Commission</a> [official website] in 1986, but Japanese whalers defend their whaling as scientific research because they collect data on the whale's age, diet, and birthing rate, before packaging and selling the meat. In May, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">initiated proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Japan in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], claiming Japan has breached its obligations under the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/convention.pdf">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which would have conferred upon homosexual and heterosexual couples rights and benefits equal to those afforded married couples in the state, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/hawaii-house-approves-same-sex-civil.php">approved by the House</a> in April after the vote was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/hawaii-lower-house-shelves-vote-on-same.php">initially postponed</a> [JURIST reports] in January. The state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/hawaii-senate-approves-same-sex-civil.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in January. Tuesday was the last day Lingle could veto the bill before it would have become law without her signature. In the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/leg/2010-legislative-session/bills/Governor%20Lingles%20HB444%20Statement%207.6.10%20final.pdf">statement announcing her veto</a> [text, PDF] Lingle said that she felt that the bill was "essentially marriage by another name." She also indicated that the issue should be voted on in a public referendum, stating:<blockquote>I am vetoing this bill because I have become convinced that this issue is of such significant societal importance that it deserves to be decided directly by all the people of Hawaii. The subject of this legislation has touched the hearts and minds of our citizens as no other social issue of our day. It would be a mistake to allow a decision of this magnitude to be made by one individual or a small group of elected officials. And while ours is a system of representative government it also is one that recognizes that, from time to time, there are issues that require the reflection, collective wisdom and consent of the people and reserves to them the right to directly decide those matters. This is one such issue.</blockquote>Rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.acluhawaii.org/">American Civil Liberties Union-Hawaii</a> (ACLU-HI) [advocacy website], have indicated they will be <a href="http://www.acluhawaii.org/news.php?id=391&PHPSESSID=a5bd9f81a8d768f91ba038d73fc50764">filing a lawsuit</a> [press release] challenging the state's ban on same-sex civil unions as a violation of the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/lrb/con/">Hawaiian Constitution's</a> [materials] prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation. 

<p>The state of Hawaii has been at the forefront of the gay rights movement <a href="http://pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Gay-Marriage-Timeline.aspx">since the 1990s</a> [timeline]. In 1993, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.hi.us/">Hawaii Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/hawaii">ruled</a> [case backgrounder] that the state must show a compelling reason to deny same-sex marriage, but, in 1998, Hawaiian voters approved an amendment to the state constitution to reserve for the state legislature the authority to define marriage. Several jurisdictions in the US have legalized <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] or recognize same-sex civil unions. In March, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] denied an emergency appeal to prevent Washington DC's same-sex marriage law from taking effect. Chief Justice John Roberts, acting as circuit justice for the DC area, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DC-marriage-stay-09A807.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] requesting a stay pending further review of the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/images/00001/20091008141223.pdf">Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF].

Wen was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/china-court-sentences-former-top.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in April of accepting bribes, protecting criminal gangs, rape and being unable to justify his large amount of personal assets. The court's verdict stated that from 1996 to 2009 Wen accepted 12 million yuan in bribes, or approximately USD $1.76 million. Wen was also found guilty of protecting five organized crime gangs in Chongqing and raping a university student in 2007. Wen is the highest-ranking official to be charged in the <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/174696/chinese-official-sentenced-to-death-in-mafia-trial">corruption probe</a> [AFP report] in Chongqing. Wen's wife, Zhou Xiaoya, was also convicted in April of taking advantage of her husband's position and accepting bribes of 4.49 million yuan and faces eight years in jail.

<p>Wen's execution comes amid China's continuing attempt to eradicate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">government corruption</a> [JURIST news archive]. In March, the Hebei Province People's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld a life sentence</a> for former vice president of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC), Huang Songyou, who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, SPC president <a target="_blank" href="http://www.court.gov.cn/dfg/index.php?id=119">Wang Shengjun</a> [official profile, in Chinese] called for increased efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country's court system. In January, the SPC announced <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. In October, two Chongqing courts <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-courts-sentence-6-to-death-for.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six individuals to death for their connections with organized crime gangs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The captain of the cargo ship was charged with disposal of oil in coastal waters and of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iEfsbr-6P5qsnmx87c31rDUiUjPQ">not reporting the spill</a> [AFP report] to the proper authorities. The companies, including co-owners of the cargo ship, UK firm <a href="http://www.swire.com/eng/global/home.htm">Swire Navigation</a> [corporate website] and Hong Kong firm Bluewind Shipping, were also charged with disposal of oil in coastal waters. The charges stem from an incident on the cargo ship <a href="http://www.amsa.gov.au/marine_environment_protection/major_oil_spills_in_australia/Pacific_Adventurer/index.asp">Pacific Adventurer</a> [AMSA backgrounder], where containers on the ship fell overboard during a storm, piercing the side of the ship and resulting in the oil being spilled. Prosecutors contend that the containers were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iGkFIQzne8qyt2UaUv5Nvkc1q-uA">improperly stored on the ship</a> [CP report] and that the ship's captain acted recklessly when setting a particular course, despite reports of severe weather. Swire Navigation agreed last August to pay more than USD $21 million into a fund to compensate those affected by the spill. If convicted, the companies face fines of up to USD $1.48 million each, while the captain could face fines of USD $297,000. 

<p>The Australian court is not the first to apply criminal liability to oil spill cases. In March, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-appeals-upholds-oil-company.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's 2008 decision finding French oil company <a href="http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html">Total</a> [corporate website] and several other defendants criminally liable for an oil spill that occurred of the coast of Brittany in 1999. In April 2008, US federal prosecutors filed <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/can/press/press_documents/S-Indictment.pdf">felony charges</a> [indictment, PDF; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/can/press/2008/2008_04_22_cota.indictment.press.html">press release</a>] against Capt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdrilling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Obama administration <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/Hornbeck_Reply_as_Filed.pdf">filed a brief</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday asking a federal appeals court to reinstate the offshore drilling ban ordered after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">BP oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bp+oil+spill">news archive</a>] in the Gulf of Mexico. The filing in the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] argues that the court should allow for the six-month offshore drilling moratorium to be reinstated because the government will likely win its appeal of the lower court's ruling. The lower court, the brief says, "misperceived Interior's authority, the rationale for the suspensions, and the relative harms present in the Gulf. Plaintiffs and amici rely on those same misperceptions in opposing the motion." Those against the moratorium argue that it will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxix4klU3SU">hurt the gulf economy</a>  [PBS report, video], but the federal government argues in the brief that the temporary ban is necessary:<blockquote>The stakes are even higher now that it is hurricane season. The suspension orders give Interior time to further implement 22 already-identified new safety measures and to develop others as it gathers more information. Therefore, that decision was a rational exercise, under emergency circumstances, of Interior's substantial discretionary authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and its own regulations for suspending lease operations. The district court was wrong to substitute its judgment for Interior's and enjoin those suspensions.</blockquote>The district judge issued a <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/GENERAL/Notices/10-1663_doc67.pdf">preliminary injunction against the moratorium</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">report</a>] last month, saying it was necessary because the ban caused irreparable harm to both the plaintiffs&#8212;small oil companies affected by the ban&#8212;and the public.

<p>Last week, the US <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.5503:">bill</a> [HR 5503 materials] that would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-house-approves-bill-increasing-compensation-for-oil-spill-victims.php">increase compensation</a> [JURIST report] for injured workers and victims' families that have filed claims against BP as a result of the oil spill. Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP as evidence of the oil company's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come out. Two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">recently filed</a> [JURIST report] against BP alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Rackteer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.]. Last month, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] announced the government's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/obama-lays-out-plan-of-action-after-visiting-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">latest plan of action</a> for tackling the oil spill, which includes a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-to-set-aside-20-million-in-escrow-to-pay-oil-spill-damage-claims.php">$20 billion compensation fund</a> [JURIST reports] subsidized by BP. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-claims-and-escrow">escrow fund</a> [government backgrounder] will be used to indemnify the workers and business owners harmed as a result of the oil spill. The announcement also included a long-term restoration plan and <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-establishes-bipartisan-commission-for-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">prevention of future disasters</a> [JURIST report] through stronger regulation. More than 120 million gallons of oil have leaked already from the rig's broken pipe and has now surpassed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez</a>  [JURIST news archive] as the worst oil spill in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement came after months of negotiations with the Obama administration, which originally asked Germany to <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-asking-germany-to-accept-10.php">take up to 10 detainees</a> [JURIST report] from the facility. The German government indicated in April that it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-considering-accepting.php">considering accepting three detainees</a> [JURIST report], but de Maiziere stated the country is only accepting two of the prisoners because it could not guarantee the third prisoner would not be a threat to German security. De Maiziere also emphasized that Germany had informed the US it would <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5770374,00.html">not consider any further requests</a> [DW report] to accept detainees. German critics of the plan to accept detainees have expressed concern that their presence could radicalize the Muslim population within the country. De Maiziere, however, has noted that Germany has an ethical obligation in helping to close the facility. Hamburg and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate have each <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-49951620100707">agreed to accept one detainee</a> [Reuters report], who are expected to be settled in Germany within the next two months. There are currently 181 detainees remaining at the Guantanamo facility. 

<p>The Obama administration continues its push to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, despite missing its self-imposed <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">one-year deadline</a> [JURIST report] in January. The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the suspension of detainee <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the US <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/house-committee-votes-not-to-fund-US-facility-for-Guantanamo-transfers.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting the Obama administration from modifying or building a facility in the US to hold detainees currently held at Guantanamo. The bill <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/house-committee-votes-not-to-fund-US-facility-for-Guantanamo-transfers.php">requires</a> [summary, PDF] that any plan to construct or modify US facilities to accommodate Guantanamo transfers be "accompanied by a thorough and comprehensive plan that outlines the merits, costs and risks associated with utilizing such a facility." As the Obama administration has not presented such a plan to Congress, the bill prohibits the use of any funds for the purpose of preparing a US facility for Guantanamo transfers. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algeria</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new ordinance bans gun shops in Chicago and prohibits gun owners from stepping outside their homes, including porches and garages, with a handgun. The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website], states that the ordinance violates the gunowners' <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] right to bear arms and should therefore be considered "null and void." The lawsuit is supported by both the <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/home">National Rifle Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.nafr.org/About.cfm">National Association of Firearm Retailers</a> [advocacy websites]. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect July 12, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html">Chicago City Council</a> [official website] on Friday, four days after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1521">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government.

<p>The court's ruling in <u>McDonald</u> cited the holding in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>] where the court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense. The District of Columbia enacted a new series of firearm regulations following the court's ruling in <u>Heller</u>. The regulations were <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">recently upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">report</a>] by a federal judge who cited <u>Heller</u>, holding that the Second Amendment does not prohibit regulation of firearms where that regulation will "effectuate the goal of promoting public safety." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint was filed by the relatives of two of the victims and contends that the soldiers knew the victims would be killed if they were handed over to Serbian troops led by Serbian general <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to the complaint, the soldiers forced the victims from a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/Res/819(1993)">UN-designated "safe area"</a> [resolution materials], resulting in their deaths. The complaint also states that the men knew about the <a href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/07/srebrenica_families_launch_leg.php">Serbian hatred of Muslims</a> [<em>Dutch News</em> report] and about the previous execution of Muslims, making the soldiers complicit in the deaths of the victims. The lawyer representing the families has stated that evidence against the peacekeepers includes the fact that they expressed concern about the <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/relatives-seek-genocide-charges-against-srebrenica-peacekeepers">possibility of mass execution</a> [RNW report] but still evicted the men from the base that was being protected by Dutch troops. The Dutch prosecutor will now consider whether to investigate the charges. If the men were to be convicted, they could face a sentence of life in prison. 

<p>Relatives of the victims of the Srebrenica massacre have previously sought justice for the actions of Dutch peacekeeping forces, which they say led to the massacre. In March, the <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Gerechtshoven/s-Gravenhage/">Hague Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Dutch] <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BL8979&u_ljn=BL8979">upheld</a> [judgment, in Dutch; <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Gerechten/Gerechtshoven/s-Gravenhage/Actualiteiten/Mothers+of+Srebrenica+cannot+sue+UN+for+compensatory+damages.htm">press release</a>] the UN's immunity from prosecution by <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">rejecting claims</a> [JURIST report] brought by relatives of victims of the massacre. The relatives, known as the Mothers of Srebrenica, alleged that the Netherlands should be liable for the deaths because Dutch soldiers operating under the UN flag negligently failed to protect civilians by forcing the victims out of "safe area" and turning them over to Bosnian Serbs. The court found that immunity is essential to the UN's ability to carry out its duties and that the Dutch acting as UN peacekeepers <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/srebrenica-relatives-case-against-un-rejected">could not be held responsible</a> [RNW report]. The decision upheld the district court's 2008 decision to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hague-court-dismisses-srebrenica.php">dismiss the claims</a> [JURIST report]. The Mothers of Srebrenica have vowed to appeal the case to the Netherlands Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice if necessary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court declined to annul the entire package of amendments, as <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/turkish-minority-party-files-suit-to-block-proposed-constitutional-amendments.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] by Turkey's opposition <a href="http://www.chp.org.tr/">Republican People's Party</a> (CHP) [party website, in Turkish], and indicated that the remaining changes can be put to a referendum. The referendum is required because the reform package did not receive the two-thirds majority support in parliament, which was required to enact the law immediately. The remaining amendments will allow civil courts to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-07-07/turkey-court-partly-annuls-legislation-erdogan-sought-to-curb-judges-power.html">try military officers</a> [Bloomberg report], and expand labor union rights as well as consumer protections. Proponents of the reforms have insisted they are necessary in order for Turkey to meet the democratic and human rights standards required for admission to the EU. Opponents, however, have argued the reforms are <a href="http://www.ansamed.info/en/top/ME12.XAM16085.html">meant to consolidate power</a> [ANSAmed report] and to bring the traditionally secular judiciary and military under control of the government. A spokesperson for the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] expressed frustration with the ruling, stating that the court had exceeded its authority by performing a legislative function. The referendum on the remaining constitutional changes is scheduled for September 12. 

<p>Turkey has faced several obstacles as it works toward membership in the EU, including opposition to the constitutional reforms, its human rights record, its stance towards political parties and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=turkish+coup">tension</a> [JURIST news archive] between the AKP and the military. In April, the AKP submitted a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/turkish-ruling-party-submits-new.php">revised version</a> [JURIST report] of their proposed amendments, including a proposal to alter Article 157 of the <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/anayasa.htm">Constitution</a> [text, in Turkish] so that judges of the Military Supreme Administrative Court would have judicial immunity and be shielded from spurious claims. Many of the proposed revisions were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/top-turkish-judge-proposed.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] in April by the president of Turkey's <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Turkish], <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/content/view/44/36/">Hasan Gerceker</a> [official profile, in Turkish]. Last year, the Constitutional Court of Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/turkish-constitutional-court-bans-pro.php">voted to ban</a> [JURIST report] the Democratic Society Party (DTP) after finding the party had contacts with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pkk.htm">Kurdish Workers Party</a> (PKK) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a separatist, designated terrorist group. Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile; in Turkish] has sought to end Turkey's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8201641.stm">25-year conflict</a> [BBC report] with the PKK, which has been a major impediment to Turkey's bid to join the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Caspar was alerted that non-users had been contacted by Facebook because their e-mail addresses were listed in Facebook users' e-mail contacts. He estimates this privacy issue could affect millions of Germans. Facebook acknowledged that they have received a letter from Caspar informing them of the pending legal dispute and plan to respond before the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/7/germany-takes-facebook-task-over-privacy/">August 11 deadline</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report].

<p>This is not the first time Caspar has initiated legal action against a popular US Internet company over privacy issues. He recently <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/06/15/google_faces_german_complaint/">filed a complaint</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] against <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>], joining many in other  countries in contending that their Street View feature violates privacy rights. Facebook has also faced privacy complaints in other countries. In January, the Canadian <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca">Office of the Privacy Commissioner</a> [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-privacy-commissioner-launches.php">launch a new probe</a> [JURIST report] of Facebook to investigate privacy issues in response to complaints. Last year, five Facebook users sued the company in a California court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/facebook-sued-in-california-court-for.php">alleging the site violated their privacy</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was also accused of being Bin Laden's driver and helping him escape to the mountains of Afghanistan after the US invasion in 2001. Al Qosi's plea <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6660KL20100707">marks the fourth time</a> [Reuters report] a Guantanamo Bay detainee has been convicted by a <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military tribunal</a> [JURIST news archive] since the detention center opened its doors in 2002 and the first time a captive has been convicted since the Obama administration pledged to shut the center down in 2009. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] reiterated its call to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/human-rights-national-security/al-qosi-plea-first-conviction-broken-military-commissions-under-obama">end military commissions</a> and try Guantanamo detainees in civilian courts. Al Qosi's sentencing is scheduled to take place on August 9 before a panel of military officers, and he could face a sentence of up to life in prison or could be sentenced to time served.

<p>Al Qosi has been detained at Guantanamo since he was transferred there from Afghanistan in 2002. In December, a military judge <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2009/12/03/14/qosi-Ruling-_P-010-Government_Motion_to_Amend_Charges1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the US government could <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/military-judge-denies-admission-of-new.php">partially amend the charges</a> [JURIST report] against al Qosi by changing his jurisdictional basis but could not include four additional years of alleged activities under the charges. In October, military judges <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/military-judges-grant-continuances-in.php">granted continuances</a> [JURIST report] for prosecutors in the case against al Qosi, as well as in the case against <a target="_blank" href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsNoor.html">Noor Uthman Mohammed</a> [DOD materials].

The attempted bombing is thought to be part of a larger plot that included a failed terrorist attack in the UK. The indictment, filed in the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website], broadened the case of Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi, who <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-terrorism-suspect-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in February to conspiring to set off explosions in New York City's metro system under the direction of al Qaeda leadership in Pakistan. The indictment included charges against Abid Naseer and Tariq ur Rehman, who were previously arrested by authorities in the UK in relation to suspected terrorist activity in the country that is "directly related" to the attempted September attack in New York. A man referred to as "Ahmad" in the indictment was charged with acting as an "al-Qaeda facilitator" for Naseer and Rehman. The indictment also included Adnan El Shukrijumah, a leader of al-Qaeda's external operations program, who is charged with organizing the New York plot and recruiting Zazi. US officials have been searching for Shukrijumah, a Saudi Arabia national, for several years and plan to put him on the FBI's most wanted list this week. The indictment also included additional charges against Adis Medunjanin, who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-announces-indictment-of-suspected.php">indicted in February</a> [JURIST report] for an attempted terrorist attack on Whitestone Expressway in Queens, NY. The men were indicted on 10 counts including conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and receiving military training from al Qaeda. Each of the defendants faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.

<p>The DOJ revealed the broader underlying plot of Zazi's failed attack last Septemeber. Zazi is a native of Afghanistan who was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8265201.stm">arrested</a> [BBC report] by FBI agents in Colorado last fall. He was originally charged with making false statements to the FBI. In September, Zazi was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/zazi-indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-announces-indictment-of-suspected.php">report</a>] and originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charge of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction. In February, he changed his plea to guilty to three criminal charges of conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction in the US and to commit murder in a foreign country, as well as providing material support for al Qaeda. The guilty plea was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/holder-praises-role-of-civilian-courts.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] by US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website], who has been a strong proponent of using civilian courts to try terrorist suspects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its opinion, the court affirmed the district court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-639">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-denies-al-odah-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that there was sufficient evidence against al Odah for him to be considered "part of" al Qaeda and Taliban forces. The US government is given authority to detain suspects who can be considered "part of" al Qaeda or the Taliban under the 2001 <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF], and the district court found that it was more likely than not that al Odah "became part of Taliban and al Qaeda forces" after traveling to Afghanistan and attending a terrorist training camp. Lawyers for al Odah attempted to argue that the individual pieces of evidence against him could be explained without reaching the conclusion that he was a member of al Qaeda. The appeals court disagreed, holding that when viewing the evidence in its entirety, there was "strong support" for the district court's findings. 

<p>Al Odah's case, pending since 2002, was a companion case to the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-1195.ZS.html">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>], in which the court determined that Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to bring a <em>habeas</em> challenge in federal court. Last week, the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/dc-circuit-orders-review-to-determine-if-detainee-is-part-of-al-qaeda.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that evidence against Algerian Guantanamo detainee Belkacem Bensaya, the only one of the six <u>Boumediene</u> petitioners who has not been granted <em>habeas</em> relief, must be reviewed to determine if he was "part of" al Qaeda. Al Odah's case was also a companion case to the 2004 Supreme Court decision of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-334.ZS.html">Rasul v. Bush</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/us-supreme-court-rules-that-foreign.htm">report</a>], in which the court ruled that US courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges brought by foreign-born detainees to contest their captivity and treatment at Guantanamo Bay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the agreement, the US can use the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/js4340.htm">Terrorist Finance Tracking Program</a> (TFTP) [fact sheet] to access information from the <a href="http://www.swift.com/">Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication</a> (SWIFT) [official website; <a href="https://www2.swift.com/uhbonline/books/public/en_uk/bylaws/index.htm">bylaws</a>], an interbank money transfer system, to track the finances of suspected terrorists. The Parliament rejected the original form of the agreement in March, but <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-eu-reach-deal-to-access-accused-terrorists-financial-information.php">reconsidered the final version</a> [JURIST report] after additional privacy protections were put in place. Under the finalized version of the agreement, <a href="http://www.europol.europa.eu/">Europol</a> [official website] will protect privacy concerns by checking the validity of each US request, and an EU representative will monitor the use of EU citizens' banking data by US authorities. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-us-european-union-agreement-terrorist-finance-tracking-program-">praised the adoption of the agreement</a> [press release] and cited the importance of the TFTP in terrorism investigations, stating:<blockquote>The TFTP has provided critical investigative leads -- more than 1,550 to EU Member States -- since its creation after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. These leads have aided countries around the world in preventing or investigating many of the past decade's most visible and violent terrorist attacks and attempted attacks, including Bali (2002), Madrid (2004), London (2005), the liquids bomb plot against transatlantic aircraft (2006), New York's John F. Kennedy airport (2007), Germany (2007), Mumbai (2008), and Jakarta (2009).</blockquote>The agreement is scheduled to enter into force on August 1, 2010, and will be valid for five years. The agreement is then renewable on a yearly basis. 

<p>The EU and US have struggled to balance privacy concerns with anti-terrorism efforts in the past. In 2006, an EU panel said that SWIFT <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/eu-panel-says-financial-institution.php">broke privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by sharing data with the US. Revelation of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/22/washington/22cnd-intel.html?ex=1159416000&en=f2d387ba92099489&ei=5070">once-secret program</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/cia-reviewed-financial-records-of.php">report</a>], prompted sharp criticism from the Bush administration, which defended the initiative. The chairman of the US House <a href="http://hsc.house.gov/">Homeland Security Committee</a> [official website] later encouraged the administration to <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/us-lawmaker-urges-criminal-probe.php">press criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against the media for publicizing the program, which allowed the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">CIA</a> [official website] to monitor international financial transactions processed by SWIFT.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court issued the injunction in order to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/7878690/Abu-Hamza-extradition-halted-by-EU-judges.html">further examine evidence</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] against the men and determine if the US sentencing standards would lead to an Article 3 violation. The court denied claims that the men would be treated as "enemy combatants" if extradited to the US. The suspects include British citizens Haroon Rashid Aswat, Seyla Talha Ahsan and <a href="http://www.freebabarahmad.com/">Babar Ahmad</a> [advocacy website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4441680.stm">profile</a>] and Egyptian-born radical Muslim cleric <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3752517.stm">Abu Hamza al-Masri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abu+Hamza+al-Masri">news archive</a>]. All four men are wanted in the US on terrorism charges. The court held that the allegations against Ahmad, Aswat and Ahsan presented a serious risk that the men could face imprisonment without parole at <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/flm/">ADX Florence</a> [BOP backgrounder], a super-maximum security prison in Colorado. Hamza's stay of extradition was based solely on further examination of evidence, as he is less likely to serve a lengthy sentence. The court stated the reexamination of evidence against the men was necessary as their complaints raised "serious" questions of highly complex fact and law. The ECHR gave the UK government until September 2 to submit new or revised observations and evidence to be considered in the examination of the case on its merits. 

<p>The UK High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Aswat and Ahmad to the US in 2006. Aswat is wanted in the US on suspicion of setting up a terrorist training camp and Ahmad is wanted for conspiring to kill Americans and running a website used to fund terrorists and recruit al Qaeda members. The extraditions were approved only after the US offered assurances that it would not seek the death penalty, try the suspects before military tribunals or declare them enemy combatants. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of-jailed.php">extradition of Hamza was approved</a> [JURIST report] by a British court in 2007. Hamza, who is currently <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/breaking-news-muslim-cleric-abu-hamza.php">serving a seven-year sentence in the UK</a> [JURIST report] for urging his followers to kill Jews and other non-Muslims, faces US charges of attempting to establish terrorist training camps in Oregon, conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, and helping terror training in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, the economic crisis has led to a rise in the unemployment rate and a decrease in social services in many countries, with immigrants being blamed for the resulting hardship. The report cites increasing hostility toward the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> [JURIST news archive] as well as the continuing discrimination against Muslims as two examples of groups facing more discriminatory actions. The ERCI specifically pointed to the recent trend in some parts of Europe toward banning the wearing of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive], noting that the legislation is targeted towards Muslims, and called on countries to encourage religious diversity and acceptance. In order to combat the rising incidents of racism, ERCI is urging the 29 Council of Europe members that have not yet ratified <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=177&CM=8&DF=01/07/2010&CL=ENG">Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials], which prohibits racial discrimination, to do so. They are also advising countries to enforce existing laws against racism and to enact new laws in order to "fill the legal gaps that still exist." 

<p>Members of the Roma minority have been frequent targets of discriminatory government actions throughout Europe. In March, the Grand Chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=864619&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">ruled</a> [judgment text] that the practice of segregating Roma primary school students in Croatia from other pupils is <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/europe-rights-court-rules-croatia.php">discriminatory</a> [JURIST report]. Also in March, the US State Department released their 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">human rights report</a> [JURIST report] noting an increase in the killings of Roma people in Italy, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In February of last year, Italian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-begins-dismantling-roma-camps.php">dismantled illegal immigrant camps</a> [JURIST report] heavily populated by members of the Roma minority following the alleged rape of a 14-year old girl by East European immigrants, which led to public outcry and vigilante reprisals. In July 2008, the Italian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-begins-mass-fingerprinting-of.php">began recording the fingerprints</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging. Later that month, the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> [official website] called on EU member states to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/european-parliament-calls-for-end-to.php">repeal all anti-Roma laws</a> and the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights urged Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/europe-rights-commissioner-urges-change.php">change its "severe" policies</a> [JURIST reports] on Roma people. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Following the judgment, the government suspended <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_5#pt5-pb2-l1g44">Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000</a> [text], which authorized police to conduct a search of any pedestrian, vehicle or passenger in a vehicle "if the person giving it considers it expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism." Under the interim guidelines the search must now be "necessary" instead of "expedient," and police may only conduct a stop and search if they reasonably suspect the person of terror-related activities:

<p>The interim guidelines will be in place until the new coalition government of <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm/biography">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official profile] further reviews the nation's counter-terrorism legislation. May said that the government <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ilCqwtQ5v69dTK9s0NPfIXWxjjNw">cannot appeal</a> [AFP report] the ECHR ruling, but would not do so if it could.<br />
 <br />
In January, ECHR unanimously <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=gillan&sessionid=42675813&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text] that searches performed by police without legitimate suspicion are illegal. The ECHR found that British police had violated Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] when they stopped and searched two individuals in 2003 under the Terrorism Act 2000. Under Article 8, everyone is entitled to the right of respect for private and family life. The court found that although the search is undertaken in a public place, Article 8 is still applicable. "Indeed, in the Court's view, the public nature of the search may, in certain cases, compound the seriousness of the interference because of an element of humiliation and embarrassment."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lubanga is accused of war crimes for allegedly recruiting child soldiers to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2002-2003.

The suit was brought by the publishers of two Swedish newspapers, Expressen and Aftonbladet, which both ran online gambling advertisements for several foreign agencies in 2004. The Swedish lottery law in question prohibits the promotion of Internet gambling by private operators in other EU member states for profit. The publishers were prosecuted under the lottery law and fined 50,000 Swedish crowns. The publishers appealed the judgment, and the court sought guidance from the ECJ to determine whether the Swedish lottery law was compatible with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/services/docs/infringements/art49_en.pdf">EU law on service provisions and games of chance</a> [Article 49-EC text, PDF]. The ECJ held that bans on Internet gambling were acceptable for cultural, moral or religious reasons, but there should be no discrimination. The court concluded that Sweden's ban on Internet gambling was in line with EU laws, but that the nation's lottery laws were not allowed to penalize foreign gambling agencies differently from domestic agencies. 

<p>The judgment comes at a time when the multi-billion euro industry is attempting to break the monopoly held by domestic "game of chance" agencies in many EU member states. In June, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/eu-court-upholds-dutch-gambling-restrictions.php">issued two judgments</a> [JURIST report] against UK betting companies <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008J0258:EN:HTML">Ladbrokes International</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008J0203:EN:HTML">Betfair</a> [judgments], upholding Dutch restrictions on Internet gambling. The ECJ ruled in both cases that national regulations on games of chance are compatible with EU law when they are enacted to mitigate addiction and combat fraud. The US has also taken recently taken steps to tighten restrictions on Internet gambling. Official federal enforcement of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411:">Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act</a> (UIGEA) [HR 4411 materials] began in June. The UIGEA, which bans banks and financial institutions from intentionally accepting payments from credit cards, checks or electronic fund transfers related to unlawful Internet bets was scheduled to take effect on December 1, 2009, but enforcement was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-delays-enforcement-of.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] in November until June 1. The delay allowed US banks and financial institutions six months to get in compliance with the new rules designed to curb Internet gambling. The act was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/bush-signs-tough-internet-gambling.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by then-president George W. Bush in October 2006 amid controversy over the effects of the bill on US bettors and foreign companies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the agreement, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUXtrV2QU_hugo-6AVuxgVM2n5JQD9GR1INO0">five prisoners will be released</a> [AP report] within the next several days, while several others will be moved to prisons closer to Havana in anticipation of the remaining 47 being released within the next two months. Spain has formally agreed to accept the five prisoners who are to be freed immediately and has also informally agreed to accept all 52 of the prisoners. The freed dissidents are expected to leave Cuba in exile. The political prisoners to be released were all captured as part of a 2003 tightening on dissent within the country. A total of 75 dissidents were arrested at that time, although 23 have subsequently been released. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] indicated that she was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBKU7vGIjVhTuA19-erXxSTC6x4w">encouraged by news of the agreement</a> [AFP report], but would not comment as to whether the release would have any impact on US-Cuba relations. A US State Department spokesperson also indicated that the US would be willing to accept any of the freed prisoners. 

<p>Cuba continues to face criticism for its human rights record. Last week, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-chides-cuba-for-restricting-freedom-of-expression.php">criticized the Cuban legal system</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government's restrictions on freedom of expression create a "climate of fear" among journalists and activists. The report follows a statement released by AI in March <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-revoke-laws.php">urging the Cuban authorities</a> [JURIST report] to "revoke laws that restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association and to release all dissidents unfairly detained by the authorities." Also in March, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] criticized Cuba for interfering with the right to privacy in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">report</a>]. In November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/cuba1109web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cuba-continues-political-repression.php">report</a>] claiming that the Cuban government continued to repress dissidents and violate fundamental civil liberties of Cubans, and resorted to imposing short-term imprisonment measures to elude international critique. According to a February 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/todo-sobre/organismo/CCDHRN/Comision/Cubana/Derechos/Humanos/Reconciliacion/Nacional/575/">Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation</a> (CCDHRN) [<em>El Pais</em> backgrounder, in Spanish], the number of political prisoners in Cuba had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-reports-decline-in-number.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] from 234 in January 2008 to 205, while the number of brief detentions had increased.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts </a> [official website] ruled Thursday that the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] definition of marriage as between a man and a woman is unconstitutional because it interferes with the states' right to define marriage. Judge Joseph Tauro issued rulings in two separate cases challenging the DOMA&#8212;one filed by the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy website] on behalf of seven same-sex couples married in Massachusetts, and the other filed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In the GLAD lawsuit, Tauro <a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2010-07-08-gill-district-court-decision.pdf">granted summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] for the plaintiffs, holding that Section 3 of the DOMA violates equal protection principles embodied in the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] because it denies many federal benefits to same-sex married couples. Tauro stated that in light of the DOMA, sexual orientation is the only differentiating factor between a married couple entitled to federal marriage-based benefits and a married couple not entitled to the benefits. Tauro concluded that the classification based on sexual orientation was based on an "irrational prejudice" that can "never constitute a legitimate government interest." He also indicated that sexual orientation was not relevant to the benefits in question and that the only pertinent classification for the benefits is marital status, saying:<blockquote>By premising eligibility for these benefits on marital status in the first instance, the federal government signals to this court that the relevant distinction to be drawn is between married individuals and unmarried individuals. To further divide the class of married individuals into those with spouses of the same sex and those with spouses of the opposite sex is to create a distinction without meaning.</blockquote>In the second case, filed by Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagohomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago">Attorney General Martha Coakley</a> [official website], Tauro <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Cago/docs/civilrights/DOMA%20Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Section 3 violates the state's right to define marriage under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Tauro said that it is:<blockquote>Clearly within the authority of the Commonwealth to recognize same-sex marriages among its residents, and to afford those individuals in same-sex marriages any benefits, rights, and privileges to which they are entitled by virtue of their marital status. The federal government, by enacting and enforcing DOMA, plainly encroaches upon the firmly entrenched province of the state, and, in doing so, offends the Tenth Amendment.</blockquote>Both <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagopressrelease&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago&b=pressrelease&f=2010_07_08_doma_statement&csid=Cago">Coakley</a> and <a href="http://www.glad.org/current/pr-detail/glad-lawsuit-results-in-federal-court-striking-down-doma-section-3/">GLAD</a> [press releases] welcomed the rulings. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] is likely to appeal both decisions.

<p>The Obama administration has said the DOMA is discriminatory but has maintained that it is nonetheless constitutional. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-moves-to-dismiss-massachusetts-ag.php">moved to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the Massachusetts lawsuit in November, stating that it is the policy of the government to support federal statutes as long as there is a reasonable argument in favor of their constitutionality. Massachusetts, the first state to recognize gay marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/massachusetts-ag-challenges-defense-of.php">initiated the suit</a> [JURIST report] against the federal government last July. The DOJ also <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-to-dismiss-defense-of.php">sought to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the GLAD case on the basis that Congress has the authority to pass legislation defining marriage. The Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-extends-benefits-to-same-sex.php">extended some federal benefits</a> [JURIST report] to same-sex couples, including allowing domestic partners to be added to insurance programs, to use medical facilities, and to be included in family size and house allocation considerations. Last month, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/obama-extends-additional-benefits-to-same-sex-partners-of-federal-employees.php">ordered executive agencies to expand</a> [JURIST report] federal childcare subsidies and services and travel and relocation payments to the same-sex partners of federal employees and their children. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge panel ruled that US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] "failed to demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable injury if the stay is not granted." The moratorium was issued in May in response to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>] and was subsequently enjoined by a Louisiana district judge after a suit was filed by small oil companies affected by the ban. The district judge concluded that the blanket moratorium was arbitrary and capricious and that the administration had considered no alternative resolutions. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] asked the appeals court in June to stay the injunction, claiming the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">district judge abused his discretion</a> [JURIST report] and that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. In a response brief filed Tuesday with the appeals court, the DOJ argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">moratorium should be reinstated</a> [JURIST report] because the government will likely win its appeal of the lower court's ruling. The US government has yet to make an official response to the circuit court's decision.

<p>Last week, the US <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.5503:">bill</a> [HR 5503 materials] that would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-house-approves-bill-increasing-compensation-for-oil-spill-victims.php">increase compensation</a> [JURIST report] for injured workers and victims' families that have filed claims against BP as a result of the oil spill. Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP as evidence of the oil company's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come out. Two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">recently filed</a> [JURIST report] against BP alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Rackteer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.]. Last month, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] announced the government's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/obama-lays-out-plan-of-action-after-visiting-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">latest plan of action</a> for tackling the oil spill, which includes a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-to-set-aside-20-million-in-escrow-to-pay-oil-spill-damage-claims.php">$20 billion compensation fund</a> [JURIST reports] subsidized by BP. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/fact-sheet-claims-and-escrow">escrow fund</a> [government backgrounder] will be used to indemnify the workers and business owners harmed as a result of the oil spill. The announcement also included a long-term restoration plan and <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-establishes-bipartisan-commission-for-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">prevention of future disasters</a> [JURIST report] through stronger regulation. More than 120 million gallons of oil have leaked already from the rig's broken pipe and has now surpassed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez</a> [JURIST news archive] as the worst oil spill in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/08/1721792/federal-judge-orders-guantanamo.html">government had argued</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] that Mohammed was a supporter of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and narcotics dealer who had traveled from his native Yemen to Pakistan in September 2001, where he joined an Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda and stayed at facilities operated by the organization in Afghanistan before his arrest in Iran. Mohammed has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09gitmo.html?_r=1">maintained his innocence</a> [NYT report] throughout his detention, claiming that he left Yemen with the intention of seeking asylum in Europe. The full judgment of Judge Paul Friedman has yet to be released. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] has not announced whether it will appeal the decision. 

<p>Thursday's order brings the number of successful Guantanamo <em>habeas</em> petitions to 37, with 14 won by the government. On Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">released a partially redacted opinion</a> [JURIST report] denying <em>habeas</em> relief to Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=odah">Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last month, the circuit court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dc-circuit-denies-guantanamo-detainee-habeas-petition.php">denied a <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [JURIST report] filed by Guantanamo detainee Adham Mohammed Ali Awad, unanimously upholding the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-denies-habeas-petition.php">district court's decision</a> [JURIST report] despite the petitioner's "gossamer thin" connection to armed conflict. Most of the nearly 200 detainees remaining at Guantanamo are Yemeni, and many detainees have been transferred back to Yemen. In January, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspended transfers</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo Bay detainees to <a href="/countries/yemen.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] after it was revealed that the so-called "Christmas Day Bomber" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8431530.stm">Umar Farouk Adbulmutallab</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>], received al Qaeda training in Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In response to the investigation, Google has agreed to publish an <a href="http://google-au.blogspot.com/2010/07/were-sorry.html">apology on its official Australian blog</a> [text], conduct a privacy impact assessment (PIA) on any new Street View data collection activities in Australia that include personal information and regularly consult with the privacy commissioner about personal data collection activities arising from significant product launches in Australia. Since the privacy commissioner initiated the investigation, sanctions cannot be issued against Google, but Curtis will continue to monitor Google's activities and ensure compliance to the nation's privacy laws. Google is also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-launches-legal-probe-into-google-privacy-violations.php">facing an ongoing investigation</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.afp.gov.au/">Australian Federal Police</a> (AFP) [official website] into possible breaches of the nation's <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/taaa1979410/">Telecommunications Interception Act</a> [text], which prevents people from accessing electronic communications other than for authorized purposes. Google claims that the data collection was a mistake and was the result of the inclusion of an unintended piece of coding in the Street View software. 

<p>Several investigations have recently been launched into Google's unencrypted data collections to determine whether the Internet giant's practices have violated privacy laws. Last month, UK the <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/">Metropolitan Police</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-police-launch-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">initiated an investigation</a> [JURIST report] in response to a <a href="g/paperchase/2010/06/privacy-rights-group-accuses-google-of-criminal-intent.php">complaint filed</a> [JURIST reports] by <a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy International</a> (PI) [advocacy website], which claims that the information gathered in an <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//googleblogs/pdfs/friedberg_sourcecode_analysis_060910.pdf">independent audit</a> [text, PDF] published by Google earlier this month proves that company's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">interception of unencrypted data was not inadvertent</a> [JURIST report] and should lead to prosecution. Earlier that week Connecticut <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?a=2178&amp;Q=295440">Attorney General Richard Blumenthal</a> [official profile] announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">lead a multistate investigation</a> [JURIST report] against Google and requested additional detailed information from the company on its data harvesting procedures. Additionally, <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/google-launches-legal-probe-into-google-privacy-violations.php">Canada launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] in June to determine whether Google has violated the country's <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/PDF/Statute/P/P-8.6.pdf">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> [text, PDF], which applies to private organizations that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.

The indictment alleges that Uwinkindi collaborated with the extremist National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in order to kill Tutsis. He allegedly led a group of Hutus to look for and kill a group of Tutsi settlers and conspired with members of the militia to kill Tutsis who sought protection in the church where he was the pastor. According to the indictment, approximately 2,000 bodies were found near the church where the violence occurred. Uwinkindi had been one of the ICTR's most wanted suspects, with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/10486173.stm">$5 million reward being offered</a> [BBC report] for information leading to his capture. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-uganda.php">apprehended</a> [JURIST report] last month by Ugandan authorities and transferred to the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania, where he will stand trial.

Kaing <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hE5h9PB3VYTRnXquTHTyRXdhBmNg">cited a lack of confidence</a> [AFP report] in the international lawyer, stemming from a disagreement between the international lawyer and Kaing's local lawyers over how his defense should proceed. Kaing originally cooperated with the ECCC and repeatedly apologized to his victims and their families, as his defense attempted to obtain a lighter sentence for the accused leader. The defense strategy abruptly changed in November, when Kaing unexpectedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">asked to be released from ECCC custody</a> [JURIST report] on the basis that he had not committed any crimes. The rift between the lawyers was evident during closing arguments when one lawyer argued that his client was not guilty and the other asked for clemency based on his cooperation and contrition. If Kaing is found guilty, he will serve 40 years in jail, so long as this departure from his earlier cooperation does not return him to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-cambodia-khmer28-2009nov28,0,2228363.story">maximum sentence of life imprisonment</a> [LAT report]. The ECCC has <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/fileupload/duch_verdict/2010-07-01_Press_Release_Verdict_Time_EN.pdf">announced</a> [press release, PDF] that Kaing's judgment hearing will be held on July 26. 

<p>Kaing is the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">first of eight</a> ex-Khmer Rouge officials expected to be tried before the ECCC, which recently announced the establishment of an independent counselor to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-get-anti.php">oversee anti-corruption efforts</a> [JURIST reports]. In August, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] asked the ECCC to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rights-group-urges-cambodia-tribunal-to.php">determine the scope of its prosecutions</a> [JURIST report] "to thwart growing perceptions that court decisions are directed by the government." In February 2009, HRW warned that ECCC trials were in danger of being tainted for their <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-warns-cambodia-khmer-rouge.php">failure to follow fair trial standards</a>, and, in January 2009 a Cambodian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-judges-deny.php">agreed to hear a corruption case</a> [JURIST reports] involving two ECCC judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthrw.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday emphasized the importance of upholding the rights of immigrants in any US immigration reform proposal. In a report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/91455">Tough, Fair, and Practical</a> [materials; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/09/us-fix-dysfunctional-immigration-system">press release</a>], the organization called on the Obama administration and Congress to ensure that the US meets its obligations under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), which the US ratified in 1992. In order to do so, the report outlines several recommendations, including the creation of a legalization program with wide-ranging eligibility and procedural safeguards that would guarantee confidentiality and offer an appeals process. HRW also called for the US government to take steps to reduce exploitation of illegal immigrants in the work place, where the report states that undocumented workers are subject to illegal conditions and feel unable to seek legal redress due to the fear of deportation. The rights organization also called for an end to mandatory deportations in favor of allowing judges more discretion in deportation proceedings to consider factors such as time in the US and familial ties, citing deportation laws that allow the US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] to act as "police, prosecutor, and jury" with little input from presiding judges. Additionally, HRW criticized laws that require the deportation of lawful permanent residents for minor crimes and ICE practices that deprive those awaiting deportation proceedings of the assistance of counsel. In explaining the need for greater access to legal services, the report stated:<blockquote>Human Rights Watch has investigated numerous instances in which the undocumented status of individuals has exacerbated the impact of human rights abuses, including serious violent crime. The fact that they are undocumented too often prevents them from obtaining the redress to which they are entitled under both US and international human rights law. And because undocumented persons are less likely to report abuses, perpetrators are more likely to commit crimes against them and to escape being brought to justice.</blockquote>The report also described Arizona's new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] as an impediment to meeting the rights standards under ICCPR by preventing illegal immigrants from accessing the criminal justice system and discouraging cooperation with law enforcement officials. 

<p>Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">reiterated the need for comprehensive immigration reform</a> [JURIST report] and called on members of Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass immigration legislation. Obama acknowledged the frustration that has led states, like Arizona, to enact their own immigration laws. Obama called these laws "ill conceived" and "divisive" and indicated that they are unenforceable. He stated that reform should include holding businesses responsible for hiring and exploiting undocumented workers, a path to citizenship for people living in the US illegally and a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's new immigration law before it takes effect July 29, claiming the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Last week, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-brief-against-arizona-immigrations-law.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the federal district court in Arizona to block the enforcement of the state's immigration law. The brief was filed in support of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. In May, a group of UN human rights experts said that Arizona's immigration law could <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-rights-experts-say-arizona-immigration-law-may-violate-international-standards.php">violate international standards</a> [JURIST report] that are binding on the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Italian press union, <a href="http://www.fnsi.it/Esterne/Home.asp">FNSI</a> [union website, in Italian], <a href="http://www.fnsi.it/Esterne/Pag_vedinews.asp?AKey=11889">called for the "day of silence"</a> [press release, in Italian] to protest the bill, which they contend will severely restrict the dissemination of important information to the public. FNSI indicated that the strike was representative of the silence the public would be faced with if the bill were to be signed into law. The majority of Italian daily newspapers <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hXia0X1NT2IA_lAIDXibDvRrUrlg">failed to publish</a> [AFP report] a Friday edition as part of the strike, and Italian television all-news channels began showing pre-recorded programming at 7:00 AM local time. The pre-recorded programming was scheduled to continue all day, with live broadcasts resuming in the evening. Several right of center publications, including <a href="http://www.libero.it/">Libero</a> and <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/?SS_ID=-1&reload=true">Il Giornale</a> [media websites, in Italian], opted not to take part in the strike. The editor for <em>Il Giornale</em>, which is owned by the brother of Italian <a href="http://www.governo.it/Presidente/index.html">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official profile, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>], indicated that the paper <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/interni/feltri_ecco_perche_il_giornale_e_edicola/politica-vittorio-feltri-direttore-intercettazioni-ddl-sciopero-protesta/08-07-2010/articolo-id=459340-page=0-comments=1">has concerns about the bill</a> [op-ed, in Italian], but said the best way for the newspaper to protest against the bill is by continuing to publish up-to-date, informative content.  

<p>Under the proposed legislation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/italy-senate-advances-wiretapping-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Italian <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] last month, a three-judge panel would be required to grant a wiretap, and the wiretap would only be valid for a two-month period. Any publication reporting on the contents of a wiretap during an ongoing investigation would be subject to fines of USD $540,000, and the individual journalist reporting the information could also be held liable. Supporters of the bill claim it is necessary in order to protect privacy and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/world/europe/31italy.html?_r=1">curb the excessive use of wiretaps</a> [NYT report]. The bill has been <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703627704575298771076540944.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond">widely criticized</a> [WSJ report] by members of the media and prosecutors who contend the bill is aimed at protecting high-ranking officials, including Berlusconi, who are often the focus of wiretap investigations. Opponents also contend that the bill would weaken the ability of the judiciary to conduct investigations, including investigations into organized crime. The bill must now be approved by Italy's lower house of parliament before it becomes law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], claims that NTP holds the patent to the first wireless e-mail system, patented in 1995, which provided the foundation for the modern e-mail systems used by Apple in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a> [product websites] and in other smart phones and devices. The lawsuits seek injunctions against Apple, <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=0">HTC</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/index.jsp">LG</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/GLP">Motorola</a> [corporate websites] preventing them from using this technology in the future and seeking compensatory and enhanced damages for the infringement. The patents at issue in the case are the same ones over which NTP sued <a href="http://www.rim.com/">Research in Motion</a> (RIM) [corporate website], maker of the <a href="http://na.blackberry.com/eng/">BlackBerry</a> [product website], in 2001. That case was concluded in 2006 with a <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-blackberry-saved-by-rim.php">USD $612.5 million settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report]. In 2003, the district court ruled that RIM violated a patent held by NTP, and that <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/corporations-and-securities-brief.php">decision was upheld</a> [JURIST report] on appeal. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] said in January 2006 that it <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/supreme-court-wont-hear-blackberry.php">would not consider the case</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>In June, the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-trade-commission-to-probe-apple-for-htc-patent-infringement.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations made by HTC accusing Apple of patent infringement on its portable electronic devices. HTC <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/htc-files-patent-infringement-complaint-against-apple.php">filed a complaint with the ITC in May</a> [JURIST report] claiming that Apple had infringed on five of HTC's patents, and is seeking an exclusion order and a cease and desist order, which would ban Apple's importation of iPhones, iPads and iPods. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">Apple filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against HTC in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> [official website] alleging that several of HTC's products infringe 10 patents owned by Apple. Apple also filed a <a href="http://static.arstechnica.com/apple/Apple%20complaint%20-%20ITC.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] against HTC with the ITC claiming infringement of 10 other Apple patents, seeking to bar the importation of infringing devices. Apple has recently been involved in numerous legal actions over alleged patent infringement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcanada.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Ontario <a href="http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/">Ombudsman Andre Marin</a> [official website] announced Friday that he is <a href="http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/en/media/press-releases/2010/ontario-ombudsman-to-investigate-g20-security-regulation.aspx">launching an investigation</a> [press release] into the enactment of a <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/regs/english/2010/elaws_src_regs_r10233_e.htm">local regulation</a> [O Reg 233/10 text] that broadened the scope of police search and seizure powers in certain areas of Toronto during the recent <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/G20/">Group of 20 (G-20) summit</a> [official website]. The investigation will examine the involvement of the <a href="http://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/">Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services</a> [official website] in originating the regulation as well as the way information about the regulation was disseminated to the public prior to its enactment. Rights groups and legal scholars have both <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into-g-20-security-measures.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over possible civil liberties violations during the summit, particularly with regards to the enactment of regulation 233/10, which they contend may have been a violation of the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. Under the regulation, enacted under the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90p55_e.htm">Public Works Protection Act</a> [text], anyone present in certain areas of Toronto could be required to identify themselves to police or be subjected to a search. Legal scholars argue that the public was <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829917--cabinet-secrecy-opens-door-to-legal-challenge">not given enough notice</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] about the regulation and that the primary area of focus for determining constitutionality is whether the public could have reasonably expected to be able to assemble in the areas without being asked for identification. The Ombudsman's office stated it has received 22 complaints regarding G-20 security measures, including allegations that lack of government transparency led to "an atmosphere of secrecy and confusion and contributed to violations of civil liberties." Marin indicated he is taking the complaints seriously stating, "The complaints we've received so far raise serious concerns about this regulation and the way it was communicated, and I think there is a very strong public interest in finding out exactly what happened and how that affected the rest of the events of the G20 weekend." The inquiry is expected to be completed within 90 days. 

<p>Similar concerns over civil liberties violations arose last fall, following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pittsburgh+g-20">Pittsburgh G-20 summit</a> [JURIST news archive]. In December, the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLU-PA) [official website] and the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy websites] announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/g-20-protest-groups-file-amended-suit.php">extending and continuing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the City of Pittsburgh for allegedly violating the rights of two protest groups during the September summit. According to the amended complaint, Pittsburgh police officers repeatedly violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First</a>, <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] rights of <a href="http://www.seedsofpeace.org/">Seeds of Peace</a> and <a href="http://3riversconvergence.org/">Three Rivers Climate Convergence</a> (3RCC) [advocacy websites]. The ACLU-PA and CCR <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/g-20-protest-groups-file-suit-alleging.php">originally filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in September. Both groups claimed that police searched and seized members of the groups and their property and that police retaliated against members for exercising their right to free speech. Seeds of Peace also claimed that police detained their bus without cause, illegally searched and impounded the bus and conducted a warrantless raid on the property on which the bus was being stored. Pittsburgh has also been criticized for its handling of other protesters. The <a href="http://www.nlg.org/">National Lawyers Guild</a> (NLG) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-criticize-police-tactics.php">questioned</a> [JURIST report] the methods used by police during protests in the <a href="/dateline/2009/09/g-20-resistance-project-demonstration.php">Lawrenceville</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/pittsburgh-police-clash-with-g-20.php">Oakland</a> [JURIST reports] sections of Pittsburgh and also noted that individual officers lacked visible identification, frustrating the work of NLG and ACLU legal observers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Salman Hossain was charged with three counts of willfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group and two counts of advocating genocide against an identifiable group, making him the <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Muslim+extremist+charged+with+promoting+genocide/3251810/story.html">first person to be charged</a> [<em>National Post</em> report] for advocating genocide under Ontario's criminal code. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Among Hossain's alleged statements are calls for the extermination of Jewish people throughout Europe and North America, terrorist attacks on Canada and for the violent overthrow of western governments. The <a href="http://www.cjc.ca/">Canadian Jewish Congress</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.cjc.ca/2010/07/08/canadian-jewish-congress-welcomes-charges-of-advocating-genocide-against-alleged-hatemonger/">praised the charges</a> [press release], calling them a commitment to the rights of Canadians to live "free from vilification[,] ... demonization and ... genocidal threats." Ontario <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/">Attorney General</a> [official website] considered pressing charges last year, but declined to do so after Hossain removed most of the offensive material from his website. This decision was reversed once Hossain resumed posting content to <a href="http://filthyjewishterrorists.com/">Filthy Jewish Terrorists</a> [CONTENT WARNING], an anti-Jewish conspiracy-theory website. Hossain responded to the charges in a <a href="http://filthyjewishterrorists.com/the-jews-and-their-allies-have-proven-their-weakness-by-charging-me/">post</a> [CONTENT WARNING] on the website, stating that "calling for ... genocide [was] the right thing ...  a [nuclear] type assault is literally the only solution," and claiming to renounce Canadian citizenship. Hossain left Canada during the investigation and is now <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/police+expected+charge+extremist/3250182/story.html">believed to be in Bangladesh</a> [<em>Montreal Gazette</em> report], which does not have an extradition treaty in force with the Canadian government. 

<p>In June, Canadian police reported that members of the Jewish faith were the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/canada-police-report-35-percent-increase-in-number-of-hate-crimes.php">most frequently targeted religious group</a> [JURIST report] in Canada. The report, which also detailed a <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/100614/dq100614b-eng.htm">35 percent increase in hate crimes</a> [materials] from 2007 to 2008, found that two-thirds of religiously motivated hate crimes were committed against members of the Jewish faith, constituting a 42 percent rise over the previous year. During 2008, police reported 1,036 total hate crimes, with 55 percent motivated by race, 26 percent motivated by religion and 16 percent motivated by sexual orientation, an increase from the 785 total <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/090513/dq090513c-eng.htm">hate crimes reported</a> [materials] for 2007. Increases occurred among all groups, with the number of hate crimes related to sexual orientation more than doubling. In addition to the increase in the number of hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation, the report also found that almost 75 percent of these crimes were violent and that men were overwhelmingly the targets of the violence. Hate crimes based on race were violent 38 percent of the time while those based on religion were violent 25 percent of the time. Blacks were the most frequently targeted racial group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Regional officials in Osh, an area in the south of Kyrgyzstan, announced that 106 individuals had <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15305354&PageNum=0">already been detained</a> [ITAR-TASS report], with 97 in custody. The violence resulted from a clash between the Kyrgyz majority and the Uzbek minority and resulted in the deaths of 309 people, with an additional 2,000 reportedly injured. Property damage estimates exceed $71 million. The interim government under <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">President Roza Otunbayeva</a> [Telegraph profile] has extended a <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/07/09/Kyrgyzstan-opens-1400-ethnic-riot-cases/UPI-34941278703090/">curfew and state of emergency</a> [UPI report] in the area until August.

<p>A new <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">constitution took effect</a> in Kyrgyzstan last week after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved by voters</a> [JURIST reports] in a nationwide referendum. In June, the interim government under Otunbayeva announced the referendum to reform the country's constitution <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-to-proceed-with-constitutional-referendum-despite-violence.php">would occur despite the ethnic violence</a> [JURIST report] in Osh. A draft of that constitution was originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-approves-draft-constitution.php">approved by the interim government</a> [JURIST report] in May. The June rioting in Osh followed violent protests in the capital city of Bishkek in April that resulted in former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev  being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdrilling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/oettinger/index_en.htm">Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger</a> [official website] indicated Saturday that the EU will consider limiting the depth of <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+oil+drilling">offshore deepwater oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive] or placing a temporary moratorium on deepwater drilling following the recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>] in the Gulf of Mexico. He also suggested that the EU will discuss if it needs another agency to oversee offshore drilling, or if the <a href="http://www.emsa.europa.eu/">European Maritime Safety Agency</a> [official website] can sufficiently regulate deepwater drilling operations. Oettinger first called for a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/10/368&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">moratorium on new deepwater drilling</a> [statement] earlier this week when presenting a report on the risk of oil exploration to the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/">European Parliament</a> [official website]. In his speech Oettinger stated: <blockquote>[G]iven the current circumstances, any responsible Government would at present practically freeze new permits for drilling with extreme parameters and conditions. This can mean de facto a moratorium on new drills until the causes of the accident are known and corrective measures are taken for such frontier operations as the ones carried out by the Deepwater Horizon.</blockquote> 
He also called on EU member states to enforce regulations that are currently in place and to authorize new regulations where necessary in order to prevent any future oil spills. Oettinger is <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE6690JN20100710">scheduled to meet</a> [Reuters report] with both oil company executives and a panel of regulatory supervisors on Wednesday to discuss potential regulations and changes in the EU deepwater drilling protocol. 

<p>The EU is not the only governing body considering new drilling regulations in light of the BP oil spill. In May, the Obama administration issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-announces-new-regulations-stemming-from-gulf-oil-spill.php">six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling</a> [JURIST report] in US coastal waters. Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the moratorium on the basis that the ban caused irreparable harm to both the plaintiffs and the public, and that Obama administration considered no alternatives when enacting the broad regulation. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] requested that a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">stay the preliminary injunction</a> while they appeal the lower court's ruling, but the court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">denied the DOJ's request</a> [JURIST reports] for a stay of the injunction. In June, the UK announced that the government <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn10_067/pn10_067.aspx">will increase inspection</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-to-increase-north-sea-drilling-inspections-after-bp-oil-spill.php">report</a>] of North Sea oil rigs and monitoring of offshore compliance and safety standards in response to the BP oil spill. The UK government also established the <a href="http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/knowledgecentre/OSPRAG.cfm">Oil Spill Prevention and Response Advisory Group</a> [official website] to conduct a review of the country's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cameron <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/07/15th-anniversary-of-the-srebrenica-massacre-53207">issued a statement</a> [press release] calling the massacre "a crime that shamed Europe" and stating that the victims must never be forgotten. He pledged that the British government will continue its efforts to bring former Bosnian Serb commander <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive] and others before the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>]. He also stated that his government will "take a close interest in the [Balkan] region" to help them move forward and eventually join the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] and <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">NATO</a> [official website]. Cameron promised that the government would do "all in [its] power to ensure that such an atrocity can never be repeated."  In an interview with a German newspaper, Brammertz <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article8391909/Fuer-die-Opfer-ist-jeden-Tag-Srebrenica.html">echoed Cameron's pledge</a> [<em>Die Wertz</em> report, in German] to bring Mladic and others involved in the massacre to justice. Brammertz said that justice will not be completely served until Mladic is found and indicated that his capture is a test of the EU's credibility. Brammertz also stressed the importance of stability in the  Balkans and urged the international community to continue to support efforts to bring the accused before the ICTY.
 
<p>Mladic is one of two high-level targets still at large under the jurisdiction of the ICTY and faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for allegedly overseeing the Srebrenica massacre and other war crimes violations during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive].  In May, Mladic's family filed a claim in the Belgrade District Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php"> seeking to have him declared officially dead</a> [JURIST report] in order to collect his state pension and sell his property.  Earlier that month, the ICTY announced that the Office of the Prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-amend-mladic-indictment.php">filed a motion to amend the indictment against Mladic</a> [JURIST report] to include 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in order to help speed up court proceedings once Mladic is captured.  In March, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] said that the ICTY will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-to-remain-in-operation-beyond-2010.php">continue to operate</a> [JURIST report] beyond its originally planned end date, in part to apprehend both Mladic who has been a fugitive since 1995, and political leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/694/4">Goran Hadzic</a> [case materials], who both face a significant number of charges. Ban estimated that it will be necessary for the court to remain open until 2013.

Nearly 1,000 arrests were made before and during the G20, making it the largest mass arrest in Canadian history and protesters contend that both the police and the government acted beyond the scope of their authority in planning and carrying out security measures related to the summit. The protests were organized by rights groups including <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/">Amnesty International Canada</a> (AI) and the <a href="http://ccla.org/">Canadian Civil Liberties Association</a> (CCLA) [advocacy websites] and <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/834556--g20-protests-continue-as-1-200-march-sit-in-at-queen-and-spadina">called for accountability</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] from city leaders, the heads of Toronto and Ontario police forces, and Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The protesters expressed the need for an objective review independent of police organizations and the government. They contend that a <a href="http://www.tpsb.ca/documents/agendadoc.pdf">recently approved</a> [meeting agenda] independent civilian review of the <a href="http://www.tpsb.ca/">Toronto Police Services Board</a> [official website] is not broad enough in scope to conduct a thorough, wide-reaching investigation. 

<p>On Friday, Ontario <a href="http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/">Ombudsman Andre Martin</a> [official website] announced that he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/canada-government-accountability-officer-to-probe-g-20-security-measures.php">launching an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/regs/english/2010/elaws_src_regs_r10233_e.htm">local regulation 233/10</a> [O Reg 233/10 text], which expanded the scope of police powers of search and seizure during the summit.  The regulation, enacted under the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90p55_e.htm">Public Works Protection Act</a> [text], required those present in certain areas of Toronto to present identification to police or be subjected to a search.  Rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into-g-20-security-measures.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that the regulation was enacted in violation of the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text] and that the public was not given enough notice of the regulation in order to comply. The inquiry is expected to be completed within 90 days.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to reports, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gAKngeILK9omql6vIBBXdM4q8VZw">three of the political dissidents were released</a> [AFP report] from custody and taken to an undisclosed location where they will await a transfer to Spain. Spain has formally agreed to accept the first five prisoners scheduled to be freed and has also informally agreed to accept all 52 of the prisoners. Under the agreement, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUXtrV2QU_hugo-6AVuxgVM2n5JQD9GR1INO0">five prisoners are scheduled to be released</a> [AP report] almost immediately, while several others will be moved to prisons closer to Havana in anticipation of the remaining 47 being released within the next two months. The political prisoners scheduled to be released were all captured as part of a 2003 tightening on dissent within the country. A total of 75 dissidents were arrested at that time, although 23 have subsequently been released. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] on Friday said she <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35279&Cr=pillay&Cr1=">welcomed the release of the prisoners</a> [press release] and that she hopes it will be "the start of a series of significant steps to advance the protection of human rights in Cuba."

<p>Cuba continues to face criticism for its human rights record. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-chides-cuba-for-restricting-freedom-of-expression.php">criticized the Cuban legal system</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government's restrictions on freedom of expression create a "climate of fear" among journalists and activists. The report follows a statement released by AI in March <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-revoke-laws.php">urging the Cuban authorities</a> [JURIST report] to "revoke laws that restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association and to release all dissidents unfairly detained by the authorities." Also in March, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] criticized Cuba for interfering with the right to privacy in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights </a>Practices [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">report</a>]. In November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cuba-continues-political-repression.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] claiming that the Cuban government continued to repress dissidents and violate fundamental civil liberties of Cubans, and resorted to imposing short-term imprisonment measures to elude international critique. According to a February 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/todo-sobre/organismo/CCDHRN/Comision/Cubana/Derechos/Humanos/Reconciliacion/Nacional/575/">Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation</a> (CCDHRN) [El Pais backgrounder, in Spanish], the number of political prisoners in Cuba had <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-reports-decline-in-number.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] from 234 in January 2008 to 205, while the number of brief detentions had increased.</p>

Holder stated that the main goal of the administration is to hold the people responsible for 9/11 accountable in the most effective way possible, and that the administration continues to look at a variety of concerns that have arisen about both possible venues. He indicated that funding restrictions placed by Congress as well as <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/nyc-mayor-asks-federal-government-to.php">concerns expressed by local officials</a> [JURIST report] will both play an important role in the final decision regarding trial location. Holder reiterated his support for <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">holding the trials in civilian courts</a> [JURIST report] saying that the criminal justice system has been proven an effective location for terrorism trials and that excluding civilian courts as a possible tool in fighting terrorism would ultimately weaken the nation's security. One limitation on military tribunals Holder cited is the ability to sentence a person to death who has pleaded guilty. He indicated that it may not be legal to sentence someone to death who has pleaded guilty before a military tribunal, but noted that the death sentence is an option for a person who has pleaded guilty in civilian court. 

<p>Rights groups have repeatedly urged the Obama administration to utilize civilian courts over military commissions for the trials of suspected terrorists. In March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed.  Also in March, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] released a full-page advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after White House advisers announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. Holder announced in November that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism and leading the Obama administration to reconsider the decision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] said during an <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/FTN_071110.pdf?tag=cbsnewsTwoColUpperPromoArea">interview</a> [transcript] Sunday on CBS's <em>Face the Nation</em> that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will continue monitoring the effects of Arizona's recently passed <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration bill</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] and would consider filing a second lawsuit if implementation of the bill had a "racial profiling impact." The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] last week seeking to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DOJ-AZ-complaint-7-6-10.pdf">permanetly enjoin</a> [complaint, PDF] the controversial law from going into effect. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The DOJ argues that the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The agency also claims that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy. Holder indicated that the DOJ filed the initial suit based on preemption because they thought it was the strongest argument and presents the most serious problem with the law as it exists now. He noted, however, that racial profiling could become an issue if the law is allowed to go into effect and the government would consider a second suit based on possible violations of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause</a> [text]. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] has stated that she is certain the law can <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100711/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_immigration_enforcement;_ylt=A0wNdO.rAzpM2BYASAN34T0D">be enforced without racial profiling</a> [AP report]. The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Brewer in April and is set to take effect July 29. 

<p>The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-brief-against-arizona-immigrations-law.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the federal district court in Arizona to block the enforcement of the state's immigration law. The brief was filed in support of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The Mexican government has also filed an amicus curiae brief [JURIST report] supporting the ACLU suit, claiming a substantial interest in ensuring its "bilateral diplomatic relations" with the US remain "transparent, consistent and reliable, and not frustrated by the actions of individual US states." The government also claims an interest in ensuring that its citizens are "accorded human and civil rights when present in the US in accordance with federal immigration law." Brewer is also currently facing federal lawsuits filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration-law.php">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> and several <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Tuscon police officers</a> [JURIST reports], who claim they can not properly implement the law without racially profiling. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In granting the bail request, Judge Mawadze Gurainesu <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hNbBCE6frjLNM3MwgI3b4N0BcPHwD9GTGL5O0">rejected the prosecution's argument</a> [AP report] that Maguwu would interfere with the investigation by contacting witnesses. Maguwu's release comes after a statement released Friday by the <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website], currently part of the government of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/africa/july-dec08/mugabe_12-12.html">President Robert Mugabe</a> [PBS profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=robert+mugabe">news archive</a>] in a power-sharing agreement, which <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=443:maguwu-a-sacrificial-lamb&catid=42:rokstories">called Maguwu's detention</a> [press release] a "major blemish on the rule of law and the reputation of the inclusive government." The statement went on to call for greater transparency in the activities of the government at the Marange diamond fields, where Maguwu alleged human rights abuses by Mugabe's Zanu-PF shortly before his arrest. Monday's hearing was Maguwu's third bail hearing after his first two were denied. In <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/zimbabwe-court-denies-bail-to-rights-activist-investigating-conflict-diamonds.php">denying the second bail request</a> [JURIST report], Judge Chinembiri Bhunu of the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/zimbabwe.htm">Harare High Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] cited the severity of the crimes, which he characterized as borderline treason. According to Maguwu's lawyer, he has been in <a href="http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/africa/southern/Zimbabwe-Diamond-Investigator-Loses-Bail-Appeal-96827949.html">declining health</a> [VOA report] due to the temperature of his cell, which has caused him to develop throat and chest infections.

<p>Maguwu was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/zimbabwe-rights-activist-arrest-over-conflict-diamond-information.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in early June. He faces charges of false information on killings, torture and the theft of state security documents, in violation of <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/undp/domestic/docs/legislation_57.pdf">&#167; 31 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act</a> [text, PDF]. An investigation was launched after he allegedly leaked to the KP a document <a href="http://www.swradioafrica.com/news020610/leaked020610.htm">compiled by the police</a> [SW Radio Africa report] for the Joint Operations Command (JOC), a military-run security agency that was thought to be defunct. If convicted, Maguwu could face 20 years imprisonment. The ban on Zimbabwean diamonds is expected to be the focus of the upcoming KP meeting after last month's meeting <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juEpejtbYrKpXFs55DVzyHAta7Nw">failed to reach a consensus</a> [AFP report] on the matter. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has urged the body to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/diamond-monitoring-body-urged-to-suspend-zimbabwe-over-rights-abuse-allegations.php">remove Zimbabwe</a> [JURIST report] from its membership. According to HRW, human rights abuses by the Zimbabwean government have persisted since the discovery of diamonds in the Marange fields. Civil society groups such as <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/">Global Witness</a>, <a href="http://www.pacweb.org/">Partnership Africa Canada</a> [advocacy websites] and Green Advocates, have also called for the suspension of Zimbabwe's international diamond trade due to the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/6486414/Kimberley-Process-considers-ban-on-Zimbabwe-diamond-exports.html">human rights violations</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] allegedly committed by the Zimbabwean army against civilians and illegal workers in the Marange diamond fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bhopal victims groups and citizens living near the town of Pithampur, where the disposal occurred, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Dumped-Carbide-waste-should-be-moved-out-of-Pithampur-NGOs/Article1-570837.aspx">have expressed concern</a> [IANS report] that the improper disposal could have an impact on the environment and health of those living in the region and have called for it to be removed immediately. Nearly 350 tonnes of waste were collected following the disaster in which nearly 3,800 people were killed when toxic gas was accidentally released in the middle of the night by a chemical plant owned by a <a href="http://www.unioncarbide.com/about/index.htm">Union Carbide</a> [corporate website] subsidiary company. Upwards of 15,000 others later died from exposure to the gas, and 50,000 were left permanently disabled. The government reportedly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJ-cUPtM0vptTXJQwmB68FHKuWHg">removed 40 tonnes of the waste</a> [AFP report] to Pithampur for disposal, but failed to consider the environmental impact or notify the public about the disposal. Last month, a panel of Indian cabinet ministers announced the government would begin the process of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/india-to-consider-further-penalties-in-related-to-bhopal-gas-incident.php">cleaning up the disaster site</a> [JURIST report] and would consider increasing compensation for victims of the disaster. Ramesh has promised that all further cleanup of the Bhopal site will be done in a transparent manner so the government can be held accountable.

<p>Last month, an Indian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/india-court-hands-down-convictions-in-bhopal-gas-case.php">handed down the first convictions</a> [JURIST report] related to the disaster, sentencing seven men to two years in prison as well as fines for their roles in the disaster. Union Carbide and the Indian government reached a settlement as to corporate liability in 1989 with the company paying USD $470 million to end its liability. The Indian government, however, has indicated it would be willing to revisit the settlement and possibly seek further compensation from Union Carbide. <a href="http://www.dow.com/">Dow Chemicals</a> [corporate website], which purchased Union Carbide in 1999, contends that the settlement ended all possible claims against the company.

Katanga filed the appeal in June seeking a stay of proceedings and a declaration of unlawful detention by the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1076399.stm">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder] before his transfer to the ICC. In upholding the November decision of Trial Chamber II, the Appeals Chamber held that the motion had been filed too late. Two dissenting appellate judges described the standard applied by the trial chamber as a retroactive one and a violation of the chamber's discretion. According to the dissent, the trial chamber had not properly weighed the procedural interests of the court against the Katanga's rights. Katanga and his co-defendant Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui pleaded not guilty at the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-begins-trial-for-congolese.php">start of their trial in November</a> [JURIST report] to charges of three crimes against humanity and seven war crimes, including murder, sexual slavery, pillage, and the use of child soldiers. Katanga, a former commander in the <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=53981">Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri</a> [IRIN backgrounder], and Ngudjolo Chui, a former commander in the Nationalist and Integrationist Front, allegedly led two groups of child soldiers and militia in the attack against the village of Bogoro. Bogoro is located in the DRC's mineral-rich Ituri province, which has caused the territory to be an ongoing point of contention between Congolese militias. The trial is only the ICC's second case since its formation since 2002. 

<p>In September, the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icc-upholds-charges-against-accused-drc.php">upheld the admissibility</a> [JURIST report] of the case against Katanga after he argued that charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against him should be dropped because he was being tried for the same crimes in the DRC, violating the ICC principle of complementarity. The Appeals Chamber upheld the trial chamber's June 2009 dismissal of Katanga's challenge on the grounds that the there were no domestic proceedings against him at the time the charges were filed, and that subsequent investigations did not result in domestic charges. Noting that the aim of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] establishing the ICC is to ensure that "the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished." In September 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-confirms-charges-against-congolese.php">trial chamber confirmed</a> [JURIST report] the charges against Katanga. He surrendered to the ICC and was transferred to the detention facility in the Hague in October 2007 after a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc344018.PDF">warrant</a> [text, PDF, in French] was issued for his arrest in July 2007. Former rebel leaders <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lubanga">Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bemba">Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo</a> [JURIST news archives] are also on trial at the ICC for their alleged involvement in crimes committed in the DRC and neighboring <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Lubanga's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-suspends-trial-of-congo-militia-leader-lubanga.php">trial was suspended</a> [JURIST report] by the ICC on Thursday, however. Another alleged rebel leader, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0104/Related+Cases/ICC+0104+0206/ICC+0104+0206.htm">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [case materials], remains at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Eiland Commission, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-launches-internal-probe-of-flotilla-attack.php">was formed last month</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the raid, was composed of professionals outside of the chain of command for the flotilla raid and had been assigned to study the outcomes of the incident and "establish lessons." The commission declassified some sections of its findings, which concluded that the Israeli Navy failed to sufficiently consider the possibility that its troops <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/israeli-military-blamed-over-ships-raid-20100712-107rr.html">could encounter violent resistance</a> [AFP report]. The <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] reported that the probe did not blame the soldiers, but rather the navy's intelligence officials, stating:<blockquote>In terms of the intelligence effort, the team concluded that not all possible intelligence gathering methods were fully implemented and that the coordination between Navy Intelligence and the Israel Defense Intelligence was insufficient. At the same time, the team emphasized that it is not certain that an optimal intelligence effort would create a complete intelligence picture. The team also pointed out that the anticipated level of violence used against the forces was underestimated.</blockquote> The report also pointed out the operation relied "excessively on a single course of action ... while no alternative courses of action were prepared for the event of more dangerous scenarios." It also went on to commend the actions of the soldiers and their commanders, who exhibited "correct decision making" and justifiably resorted to the use of their firearms. 

<p>Last month, Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-appoints-former-supreme-court-judge-to-head-flotilla-raid-probe.php">established</a> [JURIST report] a panel of jurists to investigate the attack independently from the IDF investigation. To head the probe, Netanyahu appointed former Israeli Supreme Court Justice Yakov Tirkel, who has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-considers-widening-scope-of-internal-probe-of-flotilla-raid.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the investigation be given the same authority as a state commission of inquiry. The internal probe, approved by the Israeli cabinet, did not have the power to subpoena witnesses or recommend sanctions, powers that official state commissions possess. If the probe is considered an official inquiry, witnesses would be required to give testimony under oath. Tirkel also wanted the size of the panel to increase from five members to seven. Netanyahu agreed to Tirkel's requests, avoiding Tirkel's threatened resignation. The panel has not yet completed its investigation. Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza in May. The raid left numerous wounded and resulted in the deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists - eight Turks and one American.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-liquid-bomb-plotters-sentenced-to.php">plot was dismantled</a> [JURIST report] after a raid carried out by London's <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/">Metropolitan Police Service</a> (MPS) [official website].  During the raid, the police discovered a digital tape containing suicide videos for Savant, Khan and Zaman.  All three claimed the videos were fake and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/two-more-suspects-plead-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to causing a public nuisance at a previous trial in 2008.  Stuart Osborne, the MPS's senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, said:<blockquote>The martyrdom videos, the instructions left for the media to use them, passport applications, the loan applications and the forensic and surveillance ... all add up to a clear picture of intent. The length of the sentence reflects the severity of their crime. Sadly, this case also highlights that there are people out there who are intent on causing us harm.</blockquote>The sentence requires each of the men to serve a minimum of 20 years.

<p>The men were <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-convicts-3-in-2006-airliner-bomb-plot.php">convicted last week</a> [JURIST report] of conspiracy to commit murder. A total of 24 men were arrested during 2006's Operation Overt, one of the biggest raids ever executed by MPS, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/uk-police-charge-11-in-foiled-airplane.php">11 were charged</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060011.htm">Terrorism Act of 2006</a> and <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_1">Terrorism Act of 2000</a> [texts]--eight with conspiracy to commit murder and preparing acts of terrorism, one with possession of articles useful to a person preparing an act of terrorism and two with failing to disclose information of material assistance in preventing an act of terrorism.

The chamber found that there were reasonable grounds to conclude that Bashir had committed genocide against the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups. The charges included "genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm and genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction." The charges come after the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">reversed a prior decision</a> [JURIST report] by the lower chamber denying the prosecutor's request for genocide charges. The Appeals Chamber found that the standard of proof applied by the lower chamber had been too high, and that there only needed to be a showing of reasonable grounds of a genocidal specific intent, a showing that had been met when the first arrest warrant was issued. The warrant alleges that the Sudanese government, using the national armed forces, police and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3613953.stm">Janjaweed militia</a> [BBC backgrounder], targeted ethnic groups for extermination that were believed to be close to armed opposition groups in Darfur as part of a counter-insurgency strategy, and that as commander-in-chief of Sudanese forces, Bashir "played an essential role in [its] coordinati[on]." The genocide charges have been added to seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">filed against Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009.

Under the plea agreement Khadr would have pleaded guilty to committing war crimes and been sentenced to 30 years in prison, with all but five years of the sentence suspended. Khadr told the court that the agreement was a ploy by the US government to look good in the eyes of the international community and that he would not be used to achieve US goals. He also said the agreement would have been used to <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE66B4AS20100712?sp=true">excuse the torture and abuse of a child</a> [Reuters report]. Khadr, who <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4l6RRZ7aHdcN0M3TH3QNk5CA_Zw">fired his American defense lawyers</a> [AFP report] last week, also informed the US military tribunal that he will not be participating or offer a defense when his case goes to trial, saying that the will be the same regardless of whether he is represented at trial. When Judge Patrick Parrish asked Khadr if he would be representing himself, Khadr indicated that he would be present at trial, but would not participate because the process offers him no hope of justice.  Khadr is facing <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed one US soldier and injured another. He faces a life sentence if he is found guilty at his trial before the US military commission, which is <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-judge-sets-opening-date-for-khadr-trial.php">set to begin on August 10</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Khadr's defense lawyers have repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/canada-court-orders-pm-to-request.php">sought his repatriation</a> [JURIST report] to Canada on the basis that the Canadian government's refusal to request repatriation from the US violates the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. The Harper administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">announced</a> in February that they would not pursue Khadr's repatriation, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the government was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">not obligated to seek his return</a> [JURIST reports] to Canada despite having his Charter rights violated. In May, a UN official called on the US and Canada to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-calls-for-khadrs-release-to-canada.php">respect international conventions</a> [JURIST report] and release Khadr into Canadian custody. The UN claimed that since Khadr was 15 when he was captured, his detention would fall in line with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], which has been ratified by Canada, but not the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/11/c_13394814.htm">new regulations</a> [Xinhua report], which apply to county-level and higher-ranking political officials, party officers and employees of public institutions and state-held business entities, require individuals to disclose their family's investment holdings, property and income, as well as the marital statuses, employment statuses and whereabouts of all family members. The inclusion of detailed information about family members in the new disclosure requirements is intended to deter officials from hiding ill-gotten assets and bribes under family members' names, a practice the government believes to be widespread. While the regulations, enacted by the <a href="http://www.gov.cn/gjjg/2005-08/01/content_18608.htm">General Office of China's State Council</a> [official website, in Chinese] and the General office of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/ccp.htm">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], do not go so far as to require public disclosure of the financial information in question, feedback from Chinese citizens posted to state-run portals has shown the move to be <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/12/c_13396165.htm">well received</a> [Xinhua report]. The regulations also institute stiffer penalties for failure to comply, with offenders now facing a range of disciplines from public sanction to removal from office. 

<p>The expanded regulations are the latest salvo by the Chinese government in a years-long battle against what is perceived to be <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">pervasive corruption</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state's various business and administrative bodies. Last week, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] a top judicial official after a corruption probe in the southwestern city of Chongquing revealed he had taken nearly $2 million in bribes and had been protecting a number of organized crime gangs. In March, the Hebei Province People's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld a life sentence</a> for the former vice president of China's Supreme People's Court (SPC), Huang Songyou, who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, SPC president Wang Shengjun called for increased efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country's court system. In January, the SPC announced <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. In October, two Chongqing courts <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-courts-sentence-6-to-death-for.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six individuals to death for their connections with organized crime gangs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint names former Israeli prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4135680.stm">Ehud Olmert</a>, former foreign minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7621536.stm">Tzipi Livni</a>, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7535346.stm">Defense Minister Ehud Barak</a> [BBC profiles] for <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvaTEtRmeoHZeH3MOo9FVaeGcuKQ">violating anti-terror laws</a> [AFP report] and laws requiring the protection of civilians during the 22-day conflict in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5122404.stm">Gaza Strip</a> [BBC backgrounder]. If the complaint is accepted by the Rabat chief prosecutor, the Israeli officials would face arrest upon entering Moroccan jurisdiction. Israeli officials have faced several arrest threats following the operation in which an estimated 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed. In January, a military delegation <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-officers-abandon-uk-visit.php">canceled a trip to the UK</a> [JURIST report] over fears that they would be arrested on war crimes charges for their involvement in the conflict under several British warrants. The arrest warrants were the result of Palestinian plaintiffs working with British lawyers to file charges against Israeli officials under <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder], which allows a country to prosecute serious crimes against humanity no matter where the activity takes place. In December, Livni <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a UK trip</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on war crimes charges relating to the Gaza offensive.

<p>Israel has faced mounting international pressure following the Gaza conflict. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/12session/A-HRC-12-48.pdf">Goldstone Report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goldstone">news archive</a>] accused both the <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Force</a> (IDF) [official website] and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/hamas.htm">Hamas</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] of war crimes during the conflict. Both Israel and Hamas conducted independent investigations into the incident after the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] in November giving them three months to probe possible war crimes committed during the Gaza conflict. Hamas reported to the UN that its independent investigation had absolved Palestinian forces of any wrongdoing. Israel presented a report to the UN in February <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-military-officials-disciplined.php">detailing its role in the conflict</a> [JURIST report] and noting that two high-ranking Israeli officers were indicted for their actions during the incident. Rights groups have questioned the impartiality of the internal investigations. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused both Israel and Hamas of <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/israel-hamas-failed-to-conduct-credible.php">failing to conduct credible investigations</a> [JURIST report] into accusations of war crimes during the conflict. In February, HRW criticized Israel for failing to demonstrate that it would conduct a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-probe-of-gaza-fighting-not.php">thorough and impartial investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the alleged war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/ATTPrepCom/index.htm">Arms Trade Treaty Preparatory Committee</a> (PrepCom) [official website], established following a 2008 <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/63/334&Lang=E">report</a> [text] by the Group of Governmental Experts, has been examining the scope and draft parameters of a 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/un-votes-to-begin-work-on-global-arms.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] in order to make recommendations on an international, legally binding arms treaty. After fully considering the findings and recommendations of the PrepCom, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] plans to <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE66B6FO20100712?sp=true">finalize the treaty</a> [Reuters report] in 2012. The <a href="http://www.controlarms.org/en">Control Arms Campaign</a>, a network including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI), <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/">Oxfam</a> and <a href="http://www.soudapaz.org/">Instituto Sou da Paz</a> [advocacy websites], has called on the UN to draft an effective treaty <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/states-urged-agree-new-arms-trade-treaty-2010-07-12">regulating all weapons, ammunition and related equipment</a> [press release]. In outlining the need for an effective treaty, the organizations explained:<blockquote>Half of the world's poorest people live in states that are at risk of, or experiencing, violent conflict. Conventional arms, especially small arms, light weapons and associated ammunition, are used for the majority of grave human rights violations. Now is the time for an Arms Trade Treaty that really protects people, not just states.</blockquote> In addition to strong arms regulation, the Control Arms Campaign is advocating for the treaty to contain specific international human rights, humanitarian law and sustainable development criteria. While 151 of the 192 UN member states voted to begin formal negotiations in December 2009, 19 states, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan, have consistently abstained in the General Assembly votes on the Arms Trade Treaty, with Zimbabwe voting against.  

<p>In May, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] urged Central African nations to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dnp---un-secretary-general.php">adopt a legally binding instrument</a> [JURIST report] to combat illicit arms trafficking. In March, UN officials warned that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34134&Cr=weapons&Cr1=">arms trafficking was interfering with development</a> [UN News Centre report] in Central Africa's security and justice by increasing cross-border crime.

In April, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> and Russian <a href="http://eng.medvedev.kremlin.ru/biography">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profiles] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the New START treaty</a> [JURIST report], pledging to reduce their countries' nuclear warheads by about 30 percent.

Earlier this month, the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] held that Khadr, who is a Canadian citizen, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/canada-court-orders-government-to-remedy-khadr-rights-breach.php">has a right to "procedural fairness and natural justice"</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], and the government has so far failed to take appropriate action to guarantee these rights. On filing the appeal, <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/mag-mpg/index.html">Minister of Justice and Attorney General Rob Nicholson</a> [official profile] said:<blockquote>This case raises important issues concerning the Crown prerogative over foreign affairs. As the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in an earlier case involving Mr. Khadr, 'it would not be appropriate for the Court to give direction as to the diplomatic steps necessary to address the breaches of Mr. Khadr's Charter rights.' Omar Khadr faces very serious charges, including murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, material support for terrorism, and spying.</blockquote>Khadr's lawyers said they <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/07/12/omar-khadr-court-ruling-nicholson.html">doubt the court could reach a decision</a> [CBC report] before Khadr's US military commission trial, which is <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-judge-sets-opening-date-for-khadr-trial.php">set to begin on August 10</a> [JURIST report]. Also on Monday at his US military commission pre-trial, Khadr told the presiding judge, Army Colonel Patrick Parrish, that he intends to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-tells-court-he-previously-rejected-plea-deal.php">boycott his upcoming trial</a> [JURIST report] and requested to fire his court-appointed military lawyer. Parrish denied the request after Khadr fired his US civilian lawyers and sought to represent himself last week. 

<p>Khadr has been held at <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] since his 2002 capture by US forces in Afghanistan when he was 15 years old. He is facing <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed one US soldier and injured another, although he has repeatedly denied the accusations. Khadr <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">sought judicial review</a> from the Federal Court following the Supreme Court's decision in January that Canadian government could continue to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">refuse to request his repatriation</a> [JURIST reports] from Guantanamo, even though the judges unanimously agreed that the government had breached Khadr's Charter rights. According to the ruling, Canadian officials questioned Khadr even though they knew he was being indefinitely detained and with knowledge that he was subjected to three weeks sleep deprivation by US authorities. In May, a UN official called on the US and Canada to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-calls-for-khadrs-release-to-canada.php">respect international conventions</a> [JURIST report] and release Khadr into Canadian custody. The UN claimed that since Khadr was 15 when he was captured, his detention would fall in line with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], which has been ratified by Canada, but not the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The predawn operation, dubbed "Il crimine," the largest such action in 15 years, involved more than 3000 police in numerous provinces, but most arrests were concentrated in the southern region of Calabria and the northern region of Lombardy. Among those arrested were Pino Neri, suspected of leading the 'Ndrangheta's northern operation in Milan, and Domenico Oppedisano, who authorities believe to be the head of the organization. The 'Ndrangheta has emerged in recent years as the largest of Italy's organized crime operations, and has been <a href="http://www.poliziadistato.it/pds/file/files/Approfondimento.pdf">implicated</a> [police report, in Italian] in illegal activities ranging from murder, kidnapping and extortion to drug and weapons trafficking and infiltration of local government. Italian <a href="http://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/ministero/ministro/">Interior Minister Roberto Maroni</a> [official biography, in Italian] characterized "Il crimine" as a major blow to the organization stating, "This is absolutely the most important operation against the 'Ndrangheta in recent years ... today [we] struck the 'Ndrangheta at the heart of its criminal system, both in terms of organization and in terms of finance."

<p>Tuesday's arrests come amid controversy surrounding last month's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/italy-senate-advances-wiretapping-bill.php">advancement</a> [JURIST report] through the Italian senate of a hotly contested bill that would impose new constraints on wiretapping operations.  The <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/33809.htm">bill</a> [materials, in Italian] would criminalize the reporting of wiretap investigations by the media and would require a panel of judges to approve new wiretaps, something opponents of the bill claim would impair government efforts to combat organized crime. Last month, the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] released a report detailing the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/tocta/TOCTA_Report_2010_low_res.pdf">globalization of organized crime</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-releases-report-detailing-impact-of-global-organized-crime.php">report</a>] and its threat to international security. At a conference in May, Antonia Maria Costa, Executive Director of the UNODC called for international efforts to fight organized crime, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-stresses-need-for-international-efforts-in-fighting-organized-crime.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] about the inadequacy of current checks and saying that criminal organizations are <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/May/crime-commission-opens-in-vienna-with-call-for-better-justice-delivery.html">gaining economic strength</a> [press release].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under current Afghan law, government ministers are immune from prosecution in the traditional court system. The cabinet's approval comes one week before the Afghan government is expected to ask for additional funds from the international community in order to help in the country's rebuilding efforts. The approval of the funds may be contingent on the government's ability to reduce corruption, which is reportedly extensive. <a href="http://www.iwaweb.org/">Integrity Watch Afghanistan</a> (IWA) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.iwaweb.org/src/IWA%20corruption%20survey%202010.pdf">reports</a> [text, PDF] that Afghans paid USD $1 billion in bribes in 2009, and that corruption <a href="http://www.iwaweb.org/corruptionSurvey2010/NationalCorruption2010.html">threatens the country's legitimacy</a> [press release]. <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> (TI) [advocacy website], in its 2009 <a href="http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table">Corruptions Perceptions Index</a> (CPI) [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-afghanistan-ranked-most-corrupt.php">report</a>], ranked Afghanistan one of the world's most corrupt countries. The bill must now be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hzIp1CSZickZL4JnXQDBQy04YMGg">approved</a> [AFP report] by the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/">Afghan Parliament</a> [official website] or passed by presidential decree. 

<p>In March, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], during a surprise visit to the country, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-urges-afghanistan-government-to.php">urged the Afghan government to reduce corruption</a> [JURIST report] and institute an effective judicial system.

In a report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/91466"><em>Ten-Dollar Talib</em></a> [materials], the human rights organization criticized recent actions taken by the government of Afghan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] to end the ongoing conflict with the Taliban and other insurgent groups, claiming they ignored women's rights in favor of reaching an expedient resolution. HRW criticized what it called politically motivated actions that undermine women's rights, such as Karzai's <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/afghanistan-president-signs-law.php">signing</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/ISL431909.htm">Shia Personal Status Law</a> [Reuters backgrounder], and his pardon of two convicted rapists. HRW explained: <blockquote>The Afghan government and its international supporters have ignored the need to protect women in programs to reintegrate insurgent fighters and have not guaranteed that women's rights will be included in potential talks with the Taliban[.] ... Afghan women shouldn't have to give up their rights so the government can cut a deal with the Taliban[.] ... It would be a tragic betrayal to snatch away the progress made by and for women and girls over the past nine years.</blockquote> In avoiding this result, HRW renewed its <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-afghanistan-to.php">previous call</a> [JURIST report] for the immediate repeal of a law that became effective in January that allows immunity for Taliban fighters who join the reconciliation process, which it described as an abdication of Afghanistan's obligation under international law to prosecute the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. HRW also urged the Afghan government to require that all militants participating in the reconciliation process explicitly affirm their support for gender equality, as mandated by Article 22 of the <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html">Afghan Constitution</a> [text]. The report went on to criticize the international community, including the UN, US and NATO, which HRW says has failed to provide adequate oversight of the reconciliation process and has ignored women's rights in favor of bringing the war to an end.

<p>Women's rights in Afghanistan faced significant opposition under the Taliban, which ruled the country from 1996-2001. This rights situation has been ameliorated since the US-led invasion, but continues to face opposition from Afghan government officials and militants. In August 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/amended-afghanistan-personal-status-law.php">HRW criticized the Shia Personal Status Law</a> as violating the Afghan Constitution and severely undermining women's rights, despite an <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/afghanistan-revises-marital-sex.php">announcement the previous month</a> [JURIST reports] that provisions requiring a wife to submit to sex with her husband and to obtain his permission before leaving the home were removed. In April 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/afghanistan-women-protest-controversial.php">300 Afghan women protested the law</a> [JURIST report] and were confronted by 1,000 counter-protesters, some of whom threw stones and gravel at the women. Earlier that month, the Taliban <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/afghanistan-lawmaker-and-womens-rights.php">claimed responsibility for killing Sitara Achakzai</a> [JURIST report], an Afghan politician and women's rights advocate, outside her home. In 2006, Safia Hana Jan, another women's rights advocate and director of the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/kandahar.htm">Kandahar</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/afghan-womens-rights-advocate-murdered.php">killed by armed gunmen</a> [JURIST report] after she publicly criticized the Taliban.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdrilling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&PageID=38375">new six-month drilling moratorium</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday, citing new evidence regarding safety concerns after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">BP oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>]. Unlike the previously ordered moratorium, this one is not based on the depths at which drilling occurs. Instead, the moratorium affects drilling with specific technologies, although the applicable technologies are most often used during deepshore drilling and will not affect shallow water drilling operations. The new plan, the government says, offers more specifics on the types of drilling that will and will not be banned. In a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/doinews/Secretary-Salazar-Issues-New-Suspensions-to-Guide-Safe-Pause-on-Deepwater-Drilling.cfm">press release</a> [text], Salazar said that the new pause on deepwater drilling will provide time to implement recent safety reforms and for:<blockquote>1. The submission of evidence by operators demonstrating that they have the ability to respond effectively to a potential oil spill in the Gulf, given the unprecedented commitment of available oil spill response resources that are now being dedicated to the BP oil spill;

<p>2. The assessment of wild well intervention and blowout containment resources to determine the strategies and methods by which they can be made more readily available should another blowout occur; and</p>

<p>3. The collection and analysis of key evidence regarding the potential causes of the April 20, 2010 explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig, including information collected by the Presidential Commission and other investigations.</blockquote>In this period, the government will also create interim safety rules in accordance with recommendations submitted to President Barack Obama in May and is supported by an "extensive record of existing and new information indicating that allowing new deepwater drilling to commence would pose a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to the marine, coastal, and human environment." Government lawyers on Monday also asked the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] to lift its <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_morat.html">order barring the previous moratorium</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">report</a>] because the new plan had been filed. The plaintiffs who sued to block the original moratorium said <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iM1T8GtiBLmkcVfhDRmNAtfeJmJwD9GU99680">they have substantial concerns about the ban</a> [AP report], but have not announced whether they will challenge it. Those against the moratorium argue that it will unnecessarily <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxix4klU3SU">hurt the gulf economy</a> [PBS video].</p>

<p>Last week, the Obama administration filed a brief asking the court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">reinstate the original offshore drilling ban</a> [JURIST report] after a district judge issued a <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/GENERAL/Notices/10-1663_doc67.pdf">preliminary injunction against the moratorium</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">report</a>], saying it was necessary because the ban caused irreparable harm to both the plaintiffs - small oil companies affected by the ban - and the public. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] contended that the district judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">abused his discretion</a> [JURIST report] in issuing the injunction and that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. More than 120 million gallons of oil have leaked already from the rig's broken pipe and has now surpassed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a>  [JURIST news archive] as the worst in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkagan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Tuesday delayed a vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/meet-osg.html">Elena Kagan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kagan">news archive</a>] at the request of <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/">Senator Jeff Sessions</a> (R-AL) [official website]. The vote on whether to send the nomination for consideration by the full Senate is <a href="http://www.senate.gov/fplayers/CommPlayer/commFlashPlayer.cfm?fn=judiciary071310&st=xxx">now scheduled for July 20</a> [hearing video] after Sessions, the ranking member on the committee, requested that the vote be delayed under committee rules allowing any member to do so. In requesting the delay, Sessions described the confirmation process as moving in an "expeditious manner," and went on to outline his potential objections to Kagan's confirmation. Among them, he called Kagan's answers to questions during her confirmation hearings as "less than candid" and expressed concern over her positions on legislation during her time working in the Clinton administration. Sessions explained: <blockquote>The nominee lacks the experience and intellectual rigor that you develop from [the] full-time practice of law and serving as a judge. She's had neither of those experiences and I think it showed in her testimony. ... [H]er testimony lacked the clarity and strict intellectual honesty that I think we should look for in a nomination to the Supreme Court.</blockquote> Sessions also called for further clarification of Kagan's participation in her role as solicitor general in the efforts of the Obama administration to defend against a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the recently enacted <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>], describing her denial of involvement as insufficient. Also on Tuesday, Judiciary Committee <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Chairman Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=acef0043-7039-4d8e-9407-53dd09094777">announced that he will support Kagan's nomination</a> [press release], describing her as possessing "an impressive knowledge of the law and fidelity to it[.] ... She made clear that she will base her approach to deciding cases on the law and the Constitution, not politics or an ideological agenda."

<p>Kagan's confirmation hearings <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kagan-addresses-political-bias-first-amendment-as-confirmation-hearings-continue.php">concluded two weeks ago</a> [JURIST report]. During the hearings, Kagan addressed the effect of political bias on the court and stressed the importance of not bringing politics to the bench. "Every judge has to do what he or she thinks the law requires. But on the other hand, there's no question that the court is served best and our country is served best when people trust the court as an entirely non-political body." Kagan later discussed the balancing test she deems necessary in resolving <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] lawsuits. Kagan's confirmation hearings <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/senate-offer-opposing-views-on-kagans-experience-as-confirmation-hearings-begin.php">began late last month</a> [JURIST report] with Democratic and Republican senators offering contrasting interpretations of Kagan's judicial philosophy and lack of experience on the bench. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-nominates-solicitor-general-elena-kagan-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated Kagan</a> [JURIST report] in May to replace Justice John Paul Stevens, who <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/justice-stevens-to-retire-from-us.php">announced his retirement</a> [JURIST report] in April. Kagan became the first woman <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/harvard-law-dean-kagan-becomes-first.php">confirmed as Solicitor General</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawmakers are asking that the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] investigate whether BP played a role in lobbying for the release of al-Megrahi in exchange for a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/06/27/business-af-libya-bp-oil_7723441.html?boxes=financechannelAP">2007 contract</a> [AP report] with Libya allowing the company to drill in the country's coastal waters. Al-Megrahi, a former Libyan intelligence official, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-secretary-orders.php">released from custody</a> [JURIST report] last August on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with cancer and subsequently returned to his native Libya. His release was controversial, with both <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-officials-criticize-lockerbie-bomber.php">US officials</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/scotland-parliament-votes-to-condemn.php">Scottish Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] condemning his release. In a <a href="http://lautenberg.senate.gov/assets/071210-Megrahi-hearing-request.pdf">letter to the committee</a> [text, PDF], <a href="http://lautenberg.senate.gov/">Senator Frank Lautenberg</a> (D-NJ) [official website] stated that serious questions remain regarding the veracity of medical reports detailing al-Megrahi's health at the time of his release as well as regarding BP's role in the negotiations for his freedom. Lautenberg cites BP's 2007 admission that they, "told the UK ... it was concerned that a delay in concluding a prisoner transfer with the Libyan government might hurt" the oil deal as evidence that further investigation is warranted. The call for a Senate Judiciary Committee investigation comes one week after a group of senators, including Lautenberg, <a href="http://gillibrand.senate.gov/">Kirsten Gillibrand</a> (D-NY), <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Charles Schumer</a> (D-NY) and <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/">Bob Menendez</a> (D-NJ) [official websites], urged the British government to <a href="http://lautenberg.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=326242&">conduct a "full, transparent" investigation</a> [press release] into the circumstances surrounding al-Megrahi's release. 

<p>Al-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the Pan Am bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison, which he subsequently appealed. In November 2008, the Scottish <a href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/justiciary/index.asp">High Court of Judiciary</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/scotland-court-denies-bail-for.php">denied al-Megrahi's request to be released</a> [JURIST report] on bail during the appeals process. In March 2008, lawyers for al-Megrahi were <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/scotland-court-denies-lockerbie-bombing.php">denied access to a "missing document,"</a> that they had <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/lockerbie-bombing-lawyers-seeking.php">sought in appealing his conviction</a> [JURIST reports]. The Scottish <a href="http://www.sccrc.org.uk/home.aspx">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a> (SCCRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/scotland-commisson-sends-lockerbie.php">granted an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in al-Megrahi's case in June 2007 and referred it the High Court after the commission <a href="http://www.sccrc.org.uk/ViewFile.aspx?id=293">identified six grounds for a possible "miscarriage of justice"</a> [press release, PDF] in his trial and conviction. In 2003, Libya made its <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/libya-makes-final-payment-to-terrorism.php">final compensation payment</a> [JURIST report] to a US fund for victims' families in November 2008 after agreeing to accept responsibility for the 1988 airline bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed all <a href="http://www.victimsofpanamflight103.org/">259 on board</a> [memorial website] including 180 Americans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The documents contain various versions of an April 29 speech to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwbjs/zygy/wangchen/jl/200905/t307040.htm">Wang Chen</a> [official profile, in Chinese], Director of the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China</a> and Deputy Director of the <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64114/75332/">Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China</a> [official websites, in Chinese]. The HRIC website provides two different texts of the speech, the original posted May 4 and an <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/175110">abridged version</a> [text] posted the next day, from which <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/article?revision_id=175115&amp;item_id=175084">all mention of the identity disclosure requirements was removed</a> [text comparison] before the speech was apparently removed from the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwbjs/zygy/wangchen/jh/">SCIO speech archive</a> [official website] altogether. Much of the excised material details the Chinese government's past efforts and future plans to constrict the flow of dissenting and overseas information and use the Internet to spread pro-state propaganda. In one section, Wang lays out new plans to "strengthen [China's] supervision" of Internet content by curbing opportunities for anonymous discussion:<blockquote>We are implementing ... a permission and examination and approval system to handle online information services involving ideological security and public interests.  We are also establishing a robust series of management procedures ... to handle harmful information and prevent the infiltration of harmful information from overseas ...  On major news websites and key commercial websites, we are implementing a system to require real-name identification of forum moderators and a function that successfully removes "anonymous comments" on news stories.  We are also exploring an identity authentication system for users of online bulletin boards.</blockquote>

<p>HRIC's revelation comes on the heels of a June announcement that Google will continue to operate its <a href="http://www.google.cn/">google.cn</a> Internet search engine in mainland China, ending a four-month period during which the site simply redirected to the uncensored <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/webhp?hl=zh-CN&amp;sourceid=cnhp">google.hk</a> [search websites; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/google-stops-censoring-china-search.php">report</a>] after the company threatened in January to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">pull out of China entirely</a> [JURIST report].  Earlier last month, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/china-government-defends-internet-censorship-laws.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its Internet censorship laws in a <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-06/08/c_13339232.htm">report</a> [materials] on Internet usage in the country.  In February, the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">announced new regulations</a> [JURIST report] further restricting Internet use by requiring Chinese citizens to submit identity cards and meet with regulars before registering a website, prompting many to register sites overseas to avoid regulation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the legislation, women who wear the veil can be required by police to show their face, and, if they refuse, they can be forced to attend citizenship classes or be charged a USD $185 fine. The proposed legislation would also make it a crime to force a woman to cover her face, with a penalty of one year in prison and a fine of USD $18,555. The National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-begins-debate-on-bill-to-ban-burqa.php">began debate on the bill</a> last week, after the French cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/france-cabinent-approves-legislation-to-ban-burqa.php">approved the legislation</a> [JURIST reports] in May. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/france-votes-ban-full-face-veils-2010-07-13">condemned the vote</a> [press release] stating, "A complete ban on the covering of the face would violate the rights to freedom of expression and religion of those women who wear the burqa or the niqab as an expression of their identity or beliefs." The bill will now proceed to a vote in the <a href="http://www.senat.fr/index.html">Senate</a> [official website, in French], which is currently scheduled for September. 

<p>Many jurisdictions are currently debating legislation that would ban the burqa.

In May, the Quebec legislature <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2010/05/18/niqab-hearings-quebec.html">began hearings</a> [CBC report] on a bill that would ban full face veils for public servants, while Australian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/new-south-wales-lawmakers-defeat-bill-to-ban-burqas.php">voted to end further discussion</a> [JURIST report] on a bill that would have banned wearing the burqa.

The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/index.htm">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] on Tuesday published its Structural Reform Plan, which outlines reform goals for the next two years, including changing criminal sentencing and penalties to include different degrees of crimes and shorter jail terms, increasing prisoner rehabilitation, improving the efficacy of the legal aid system, reorganizing prisons to meet capacity challenges and developing more civil liberty protections. UK <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/clarke.htm">Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease130710a.htm">praised the reform strategy</a> [press release], saying "we need to focus our resources on protecting the public, punishing offenders and providing access to justice - in a way that is both intelligent and transparent." Cameron's announcement came one day after the <a href="http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/default.asp">Centre for Social Justice</a> [advocacy website] published a <a href="http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/client/downloads/CSJ_Green_paper_criminal_justice_07%2007_WEB.pdf">report calling for radical reforms</a> [text, PDF] to the country's penal system. However, others <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/news/2010/07/13/we-ll-axe-life-jail-for-some-killers-115875-22408964/">oppose the reforms</a> [<em>Mirror</em> report]&#8212;particularly victims' rights groups that support tough sentences for murder.

<p>UK criminal justice reform has been debated in the country over the last four years. In 2006, the UK <a href="http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/index.htm">Law Commission</a> [official website] published a <a href="http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc304.pdf">report proposing a breakdown of the sentencing scheme for murder</a> [text, PDF] into separate categories with different requirements and punishments. Months later, a UK chief justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/uk-chief-justice-speaks-out-against.php">spoke out against mandatory sentencing</a> [JURIST report], citing concern over the Law Commission's report and suggesting that the mandatory life sentence for murder be abandoned and that a new broad offense of "homicide" be created which would allow judges wide discretion in sentencing for different scenarios of that according to circumstances. However, previous attempts at reform have <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/uk-judges-reject-proposed-sentencing.php">met with strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from British judges, who have called such plans "kneejerk reactions" to sentencing scandals. Proponents of the reforms urge officials to limit prison sentences to only the most dangerous criminals in order to help the government deal with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4841938.stm">prison overcrowding</a> [BBC backgrounder; <em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1891332,00.html">backgrounder</a>] that has reached <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/uk-home-secretary-announces-prison.php">crisis proportions</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ghailani's lawyers had <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-seek.php">sought a dismissal of charges</a>, arguing that he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/ex-guantanamo-detainee-lawyers-argue.php">denied the right to a speedy trial</a> [JURIST reports] while being detained for nearly five years in <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] secret prisons and later at Guantanamo Bay. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] rejected this argument: <blockquote>Considering all of the circumstances, particularly the lack of significant prejudice of the sort that the Speedy Trial Clause was intended to prevent, the delay in this case did not materialy infringe upon any interest protected by the right to a speedy trial. The Court therefore holds that Ghailani's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has not been violated.</blockquote>Kaplan's ruling cleared the way for Ghailani to face a civilian trial in September for his alleged role in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">1998 bombings of US embassies</a> [PBS backgrounder] in Kenya and Tanzania. 

<p>Earlier this month, Kaplan ruled that Ghailani is not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-rules-former-guantanamo-detainee-fit-to-stand-trial.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. The issue of Ghailani's psychological state arose after he <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-subject-to-strip-search.php">requested to be exempt</a> [JURIST report] from prison strip searches because it triggers his PTSD, which he allegedly acquired while being interrogated at an overseas CIA detention camp. The exemption request was filed in May after Kaplan ruled that Ghailani must <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-orders-ex-guantanamo-detainee-to-attend-trial-despite-strip-searches.php">attend the opening of his trial</a> [JURIST report], requiring him to submit to strip searches. Also in May, Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-drop-charges-against-exguantanamo-detainee.php">refused to dismiss criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ghailani, despite his lawyer's claims that he had been tortured in prison. Ghailani was the first Guantanamo detainee to be brought to the US for prosecution. Having been held at the Guantanamo facility since 2006, Ghailani was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to-us.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the SDNY in June to face 286 separate counts, including involvement in the bombings and conspiring with Osama bin Laden and other members of al Qaeda to kill Americans worldwide. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/guantanamo-ex-detainee-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] at his initial appearance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the FCC's policy is a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right to freedom of speech because it is unconstitutionally vague and could have a "chilling effect" on speech. The case was originally filed by <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/management/foxtvstations.html">Fox Television Stations</a> [corporate website] after the FCC changed its longstanding policy to allow broadcast corporations to be fined based on isolated expletives. Fox argued that the agency's indecency test was unconstitutionally vague because it provided no clear guidelines as to what is covered by the agency's policy, forcing broadcast corporations to severely limit speech in order to avoid potential fines. The court agreed with Fox, finding that:<blockquote>Under the current policy, broadcasters must choose between not airing or censoring controversial programs and risking massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses, and it is not surprising which option they choose. Indeed, there is ample evidence in the record that the FCC's indecency policy has chilled protected speech.</blockquote><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/copps/">FCC Commissioner Michael Copps</a> [official profile] called Tuesday's ruling <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-299761A1.pdf">"anti-family"</a> [press release, PDF], stating that the court was more concerned with the "chilling effect" the indecency policy has on "indecent programming" rather than the ability of parents to protect their children. Copps urged the government to appeal the decision and called on the FCC to "clarify and strengthen its indecency framework to ensure that American parents can protect their children from the indecent and violent images that bombard us more and more each day."

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] remanded the case to the appeals court after <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-582.ZC.html">ruling</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-upholds-fcc-ban-on.php">report</a>] in April 2009 that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in changing its policy regarding fines for the broadcast of isolated expletives. That ruling overturned a previous <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-fcc.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Second Circuit, which held that the 2004 policy was arbitrary and capricious under the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text] for failing to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy. The Supreme Court declined to address the constitutionality of the FCC policy in its decision and remanded the case to the lower court for further consideration of the constitutional issue. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Virginia Phillips, trying the case without a jury, heard <a href="http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2010/07/13/Log_Cabins_Opening_Statement/">opening statements</a> [text] in the case, <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/motions.html">Log Cabin Republicans v. United States</a> [case materials; LCR <a href="http://www.lcrga.com/news/Gays-Military-Dont-Ask-Tell-DADT/201007091245.shtml">backgrounder</a>], in which the <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website] argued that the military policy violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. They claim the policy has the effect of barring homosexual members of the military from "communicating the core of their identity and emotions," or associating with pro-homosexual groups. Citing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html">Lawrence v. Texas</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], in which the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] struck down state bans on homosexual activity, LCR argued that the policy violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] guarantee of due process. Under <u>Lawrence</u> and later precedent, the government must show that an interference with the private life of homosexuals is "necessary to further [important government interests]," according to LCR. LCR also pointed to statements made by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/barackobama">President Barack Obama</a> and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profiles] claiming that the law weakens national security and that the rationale for it is not based in fact. LCR stated that it would introduce as evidence testimony from homosexual service members affected by the policy and government reports that undermine the rationale for it. Despite its objections to the policy, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/13/AR2010071300746.html">argued for its constitutionality</a> [AP report], describing plaintiffs' evidence as irrelevant and stating that the federal court was inappropriately hearing an issue that was currently being debated in Congress. 

<p>Last week, the court denied the government's <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/03-29-10-filed-defendants-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-summary-judgment.pdf">motion for summary judgment</a> [text, PDF], finding the possibility of legislative action to <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/order-re-summary-judgment.pdf">repeal the policy was "sufficiently remote"</a> [opinion, PDF] to allow the case to proceed. LCR, an organization for homosexual members of the <a href="http://www.gop.com/">Republican Party</a> [party website], filed the <a href="http://online.logcabin.org/10-12-04-filed-complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2004 in reaction to the <u>Lawrence</u> decision. In May, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-congress-advances-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">voted to repeal the policy</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/white-house-backs-amendment-to-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-legislation.php">Obama and Gates agreed to a compromise</a> [JURIST reports] that would prevent the repeal from taking effect until the completion of a review to determine what effects the repeal would have on military effectiveness, soldier retention and family readiness. Also in May, A CNN <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/05/25/rel8bt6.pdf">poll</a> [results, PDF] released found that 78 percent of American adults believe that homosexuals should be able to serve openly in the military. In March, Gates <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-announces-stricter.php">announced changes to the enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the policy to make it more difficult to expel openly gay service members from the military. In May 2008, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-challenge.php">cannot dismiss a soldier</a> [JURIST report] on the basis of sexual orientation alone. The repeal of the controversial "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy has been an important issue for Obama since he took office, as reaffirmed in his <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">State of Union Address</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In reversing the decision, the appellate court held that the district court erred in examining the evidence against al-Adahi individually, considering and rejecting each piece of evidence in isolation without considering them as a whole. This approach, according the court, led to the "manifestly incorrect [and] startling" conclusion that the government lacked credible evidence to keep al-Adahi in detention. The evidence, including al-Adahi's meetings with <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/osama_bin_laden.htm">Osama bin Laden</a>, attending an <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders] training camp, staying in one of the organization's safe houses and additional classified evidence, was sufficient to leave "no doubt that Al-Adahi was more likely than not part of al-Qaida." The court explained:<blockquote>The [district] court appeared to rule that an individual must embrace every tenet of al-Qaida before United States forces may detain him. There is no such requirement. When the government shows that an individual received and executed orders from al-Qaida embers in a training camp, that evidence is sufficient (but not necessary) to prove that the individual has affiliated himself with al-Qaida.</blockquote>Additionally, the appellate court criticized the lower court's failure to question the credibility of al-Adahi as a witness. The court emphasized the necessity of this finding because of the training al Qaeda operatives receive to create cover stories, lie to interrogators and claim they had been tortured.

<p>In August 2009, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo.php">ruled that the US lacks enough evidence</a> [JURIST report] to justify the continued detention of al-Adahi, granting his <em>habeas</em> petition. The government argued that al-Adahi, who has been detained at Guantanamo since 2002, was a supporter or member of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and/or al Qaeda, claiming that al-Adahi had acted as an instructor at al Qaeda camp al Farouq, had familial ties to both the Taliban and al Qaeda, had been employed as a bodyguard for bin Laden and that al-Adahi's story lacked credibility. In December 2009, the court found the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] in contempt for <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-finds-pentagon-in.php">failing to videotape</a> [JURIST report] al-Adahi's testimony, contrary to a court order issued in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his ruling ordering Odaini's release, Judge Henry Kennedy Jr. of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], ruled that the US government had illegally detained Odaini for the past eight years and that the US government had failed to show sufficient evidence linking Odaini to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Odaini is the first detainee to be transferred to Yemen since the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspended all transfers of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the country citing security concerns. The DOD noted that the suspension of Yemeni repatriations remains in effect but that the administration respected the decision of the court and complied with all Congressionally-mandated requirements when facilitating the transfer. The DOD also indicated that the US and Yemeni governments will work together to ensure that all appropriate security measures are taken following Odaini's transfer.  There are currently 180 prisoners remaining at the Guantanamo facility, which the US government has been <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+closure">attempting to close</a> [JURIST news archive] since US President Barack Obama took office last year. 

<p>Most of the detainees remaining at Guantanamo are Yemeni, and many have been transferred back to the Arab nation. In January, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dc-circuit-upholds-broad-presidential.php">upheld the detention</a> [JURIST report] of Yemeni Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/128-ghaleb-nassar-al-bihani#1">Ghaleb Nassar Al-Bihani</a> [NYT materials], ruling that he can remain in US custody, but, in December, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">transferred six detainees</a> [JURIST report] back to Yemen. Also in December, a federal judge granted Yemeni detainee Saeed Hatim's petition for habeas corpus, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-orders-release-of-yemeni.php">ordering his release</a> [JURIST report]. A few weeks after the Obama administration suspended transfers to Yemen, a Yemeni government official said that Yemen will build a rehabilitation center for Guantanamo detainees. According to the anonymous official, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60Q3EE20100127">Yemen will begin building</a> [Reuters report] once it receives funding for the $11 million project promised by the US.

La Rue urged the Italian government to either abolish or substantially revise the bill, warning that if it is adopted in its current form, it could significantly suppress freedom of expression in the country. Under the proposed legislation, a three-judge panel would be required to grant a wiretap, and the wiretap would only be valid for a two-month period. Any publication reporting on the contents of a wiretap during an ongoing investigation would be subject to fines of USD $540,000, and the individual journalist reporting the information could also be held liable. La Rue expressed concern about the penalties journalists would face under the bill and the effect it would have on investigative reports on matters of public interest like corruption. He also cautioned that the penalties proposed under the bill would, "seriously undermine all individuals' right to seek and impart information" in violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] to which Italy is a party. The Italian <a href="http://www.senato.it/">Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/italy-senate-advances-wiretapping-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month. The bill must be approved by Italy's lower house of parliament before it becomes law. 

<p>The Italian bill has been extremely controversial. Supporters of the bill claim it is necessary in order to protect privacy and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/world/europe/31italy.html?_r=1">curb the excessive use of wiretaps</a> [NYT report]. The bill has been <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703627704575298771076540944.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond">widely criticized</a> [WSJ report] by members of the media and prosecutors who contend the bill is aimed at protecting high-ranking officials, including <a href="http://www.governo.it/Presidente/index.html">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>], who are often the focus of wiretap investigations. Last week, a majority of the Italian media <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/italy-media-strikes-to-protest-wiretapping-bill.php">went on strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest the bill in a "day of silence" that was meant to be representative of the silence the public would be faced with if the bill were to be signed into law. Opponents also contend that the bill would weaken the ability of the judiciary to conduct investigations, including investigations into organized crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three judges, all from the Taiwan <a href="http://tph.judicial.gov.tw/">High Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] are believed to have <a href="http://www.mysinchew.com/node/41781">accepted more than NT $5 million (USD $155,000)</a> [AFP report] offered to them by Ho Chi-hui in return for a not-guilty verdict granted in May. The prosecutor is accused of facilitating the deal. Ho, a former legislator, had been appealing a 19-year sentence and NT $220 million (USD $6.8 million) fine <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aSOC&ID=201007140022">handed down in 2004</a> [CNA report] in relation to a corrupt land-development project. The judges were suspended following their arrest. A fourth High Court judge is also under investigation, but has not been arrested. 

<p>The arrests come just one month after the High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/taiwan-court-extends-sentence-for-ex-president-chen.php">denied the bail request</a> [JURIST report] of former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chen+Shui-bian">news archive</a>], who is appealing a 20-year conviction for corruption and embezzlement. Chen was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">originally sentenced to life imprisonment</a>, but the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/taiwan-ex-president-chens-life-sentence-reduced-to-20-years.php">court reduced his sentence</a> [JURIST reports] in June after finding that he had not embezzled as much money as previously thought. Chen was originally found guilty on corruption charges and sentenced to life in prison in September. His wife was also <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1054894&lang=eng_news">given a life sentence</a> [CNA report] after the pair were convicted on charges of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery and money laundering. Chen has maintained his innocence against all charges, claiming that current Taiwanese <a href="http://www.president.gov.tw/en/">President Ma Ying-jeou</a> [official website] is using Chen's trial to distance himself from Chen's anti-China views. Chen was also indicted in December for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">embezzling USD $20 million from banks</a> [JURIST report] that sought to protect themselves during Chen's financial reform program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, known as the Women's Health Protection Act, requires physicians to evaluate patients to determine that their choice to have an <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] is voluntary and to <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB594.pdf">inform the patients of all risk factors and complications</a> [LB 594 text] that have been statistically associated with abortion and published in peer-reviewed journals 12 months prior to the pre-abortion evaluation, as well as earlier studies. Violations of the Act can result in a $10,000 penalty for each failure to screen or inform, wrongful death damages, actual damages and attorney's fees. The <a href="/pdf/ppheartland.pdf">lawsuit was filed</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-sues-over-nebraska-abortion-law-requiring-psychological-screenings.php">report</a>] by women's rights group <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/heartland/index.htm">Planned Parenthood of the Heartland</a> [advocacy website] and argues that the law is unconstitutional because, by setting out unreasonable requirements that most physicians are unable to meet, the law pressures those doctors to stop performing abortions or face large penalties. In issuing the injunction Judge Laurie Smith Camp indicated that she believed the lawsuit would likely succeed on the merits because the law would require screenings that may be impracticable to perform and it would create "substantial, likely insurmountable, obstacles in the path of women seeking abortions in Nebraska." She also stated that the law, if applied literally, would "require medical providers to give untruthful, misleading and irrelevant information to patients," which violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights of the physicians performing the services. The new law will go into effect on July 15, but the state will be prohibited from enforcing the law until the outcome of the lawsuit has been decided. 

<p>Several state legislatures have acted recently to place restrictions on women's access to abortion. Last month, Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Charlie Crist</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. In May, Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. In April, the Nebraska legislature approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">prohibiting abortions at or past 20 weeks</a> [JURIST report] on the theory that a fetus can allegedly feel pain following that point. Advocacy groups have criticized the laws and indicated they will challenge them in court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, filed by 12 ex-detainees, alleges that British agents took part in their mistreatment while they were held in prisons in foreign countries, including Pakistan and Morocco. The UK government had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFL180sgT0Tc4CKGXoo6U3U59w_gD9GUVI6O0">asked that the lawsuit be suspended</a> [AP report] while the government conducted an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the allegations and while settlement negotiations are ongoing.

The judge, however, ruled that the lawsuit can continue even as the negotiations are ongoing. Cameron has stated that he hopes to start the inquiry by the end of the year, once a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uk-court-rules-evidence-may-be-kept.php">separate investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of MI5 and MI6 agents at Guantanamo Bay concludes, and to have a full report back within the next 12 months.

The announcement came as part of the government's defense against a lawsuit filed by the human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], which has been seeking a review of the country's torture policy. A UK High Court judge agreed that the country's <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/2010_06_28_torture_policy_litigation_hearing">policy must be reviewed</a> [press release], but indicated that because lawyers for the government promised new guidelines would be released shortly, the court would take no immediate action. Similar claims of complicity were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">new report</a> [materials] released last week by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website].

In August 2009, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-court-convicts-top-saddam.php">convicted of forcing Kurdish displacement</a> [JURIST report] from northeast Iraq during the late 1980s, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. In March 2009, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">sentenced to 15 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for the 1992 murders of 42 merchants accused of price-gouging during a period of UN-imposed sanctions. Camp Cropper and the 1,600 prisoners held there will also be <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/07/14/iraq.aziz/?fbid=Vroe5OPfvjs">transfered to Iraqi administration</a> [CNN report] on Thursday and is the last US-run detention facility in the country.

<p>In March, the US military <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-control-of-camp-taji.php">transfered Camp Taji prison</a> [JURIST report] to Iraqi authorities. The US began to scale back its Iraq detention facilities in September when <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bucca">Camp Bucca</a> [JURIST news archive] in southern Iraq was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-closes-controversial-camp-bucca.php">closed</a> [JURIST report] pursuant to the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> [text, PDF]. According to the agreement, all US troops must be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of 2011, and the US must release all prisoners or transfer them to the control of Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government must have arrest warrants or detention orders to accept transferred prisoners into Iraqi facilities, otherwise risking release. A fourth US-run prison, <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">transferred back to Iraqi control</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. The Iraqi government has recently faced criticism for its treatment of prisoners from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. In April, the rights group claimed that Iraqi <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">detainees were repeatedly tortured</a> [JURIST report] in a secret prison in Baghdad. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, eBay allegedly filed a subsequent <a href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=%22427,553%22.APN.&OS=APN/%22427,553%22&RS=APN/%22427,553%22">patent application</a> [text] with the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) [official website] incorporating the concepts of XPRT's patents and trade secrets. XPRT seeks a minimum of $3.8 billion in damages for eBay's unjust enrichment and the lack of compensation to the inventors and patent holder, based on the estimated value of the patents.

<p>Recently, eBay has been scrutinized for various intellectual property infringements. In April, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-ebay-has-no.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that eBay is not required to actively monitor its website for the sale of counterfeit goods. The US appeals court ruling marked a dramatic contrast with other recent rulings in Europe. In February, the <a href="http://www.ca-paris.justice.fr/index.php?rubrique=11016&ssrubrique=11051&article=14755">Paris District Court</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-rules-ebay-intentionally.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] eBay to pay <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [corporate website] 200,000 euros (USD $275,000) in damages for paying search engines to direct customers to counterfeit LVMH products. In a separate case in September, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] issued an advisory opinion <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ecj-advisory-opinion-finds-google-ad.php">against LVMH</a> [JURIST report] in its suit to collect damages from Google for Google's AdWords system, which allows companies and individuals to purchase advertising space when a user searches for a product or brand name. In 2008, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">ordered eBay to pay LVMH USD $63 million</a> [JURIST report] for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the amendment, any company that has, during the previous seven years, incurred fines of $10 million under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> or <a href="http://www.epa.gov/watertrain/cwa/">Clean Water Act</a> [materials] or has had more than 10 fatalities at any of its facilities would be barred from drilling in US waters. The amendment would also hold companies responsible for the health and safety record of any of their subsidiaries or successor companies, in order to prevent corporate reorganization to avoid the regulations. The proposed legislation would apply to all drilling companies, but would immediately bar <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] from receiving drilling permits due to the 11 fatalities related to the recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>]. <a href="http://georgemiller.house.gov/">Congressman George Miller</a> (D-CA) [official website] proposed the amendment to encourage corporate responsibility among oil companies. He singled out BP as an example of a company in need of reform, stating:<blockquote>[M]any companies are proud of their safety and environment records, and demonstrate a commitment to good behavior. They are the model for what my Amendment seeks to achieve. It is regrettable that BP is a company with extensive violations and no history of working to mend its ways. Unable to change on its own, my amendment would require BP, and any other company like it, to become a responsible actor or lose access to the valuable offshore assets that belong to the American people.</blockquote>The House <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/">Energy and Commerce Committee</a> [official website] is expected to begin discussion on similar <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.+5626:">legislation</a> [HR 5626 materials] on Thursday. 

<p>US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official website] on Tuesday issued a <a href="http://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&PageID=38375">new six-month drilling moratorium</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-issues-new-drilling-moratorium.php">report</a>] that prohibits deepwater drilling with certain technologies, citing new evidence regarding safety concerns after the BP oil spill. The new moratorium was issued after a federal judge placed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">preliminary injunction</a> against the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/obama-announces-new-regulations-stemming-from-gulf-oil-spill.php">original moratorium</a> [JURIST reports] implemented by the Obama administration in May. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">appealed the ruling</a> [JURIST report] arguing that the district judge abused his discretion in issuing the injunction and that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the DOJ's request last week. More than 120 million gallons of oil have leaked already from the rig's broken pipe and has now surpassed the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> [JURIST news archive] as the worst in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, which includes adoption rights for same-sex couples, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10630683">approved after 14 hours of debate</a> [BBC report]. <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/">President Cristina Fernandez</a> [official website, in Spanish] has expressed her support for the bill and is expected to sign it upon her return from abroad. The legislation faced strong opposition from some lawmakers who introduced an alternative bill that would have allowed civil unions nationwide without adoption rights. The bill also faced strong opposition from the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm">Catholic Church</a> [official website], which organized protests outside of the capitol building that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/07/15/world/americas/AP-LT-Argentina-Gay-Marriage.html?_r=1&hp">gathered more than 60,000 people</a> [AP report]. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_bergoglio_jm_en.html">Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio</a> [official website] criticized the legislation, stating that it interfered with a child's right to be raised by a mother and father. <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">Freedom to Marry</a> [advocacy website], a US-based same-sex marriage advocacy group, described the passage as a <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/press/press-release/argentina-passes-historic-marriage-bill">"human rights achievement"</a> [press release] demonstrating Argentina's movement to "true democratic values." Recent polling has shown that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Gay-marriage-bill-splits-Argentina/articleshow/6169278.cms">70 percent</a> [NYT report] of the Argentine public support the legislation.

The legislation has been under consideration since last year, with more than <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/argentina-demonstrators-march-in.php">50,000 marching in support</a> [JURIST report] of it last November. In September, Uruguay approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uruguay-senate-gives-final-approval-to.php">granting adoption rights to same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report] and currently is the only country in the region to offer civil unions nationwide.

Despite the transfer, the US will <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/07/15/iraq.us.prison.handover/?fbid=Vroe5OPfvjs">maintain advisers and inspectors</a> [CNN report] in the detention facility to respond to any allegations of prisoner abuse and will still hold 200 prisoners, including eight high-ranking officials from the regime of <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive] in a part of the camp called Compound 5. US military officials <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9GVGQEO0">expressed their confidence</a> [AP report] in the ability of the Iraqi forces to live up to human rights standards in managing the 1,600 prisoners held at the camp and stressed that even those prisoners still held by the US were under Iraqi jurisdiction. Iraq's justice minister announced Wednesday that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-transfers-26-saddam-era-officials-to-iraqi-custody.php">26 Saddam-era officials had been transferred</a> [JURIST report] from US to Iraqi custody. The prisoner transfer, from Camp Cropper to Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad, included former foreign minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2266978.stm">Tariq Aziz</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tariq+aziz">news archive</a>], former interior minister Mohammed Zumam and former oil minister Amir Mohammed, and followed the transfer of 29 other former officials 10 months ago. According to his lawyer, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9GUUVDO0">Aziz fears for his life</a> [AP report] while in the custody of the current Iraqi government and plans to appeal to the Vatican to intervene on his behalf. 

<p>In March, the US military <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-control-of-camp-taji.php">transferred Camp Taji prison</a> [JURIST report] to Iraqi authorities. The US began to scale back its Iraq detention facilities in September when <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bucca">Camp Bucca</a> [JURIST news archive] in southern Iraq was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-closes-controversial-camp-bucca.php">closed</a> [JURIST report] pursuant to the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> [text, PDF]. According to the agreement, all US troops must be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of 2011, and the US must release all prisoners or transfer them to the control of Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government must have arrest warrants or detention orders to accept transferred prisoners into Iraqi facilities, otherwise risking release. A fourth US-run prison, <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">transferred back to Iraqi control</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. The Iraqi government has recently faced criticism for its treatment of prisoners from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. In April, the rights group claimed that Iraqi <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">detainees were repeatedly tortured</a> [JURIST report] in a secret prison in Baghdad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ's complaint claims that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. In their <em>amicus</em> brief, the states, including Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania, contend SB 1070 is not preempted by federal law unless the statute consists of a regulation of immigration or unless it conflicts with federal law so that the objective of the federal law cannot be achieved as intended by Congress. The states argue that SB 1070 does not constitute a regulation of immigration and that it does not conflict with, but rather supports federal immigration law. The states also maintain that Congress intended for there to be cooperative enforcement of immigration laws and that the DOJ seeks to supplant the cooperative scheme with a system where the federal government chooses which laws to enforce. Cox, announcing the filing of the brief, <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,1607,7-164--240761--,00.html">condemned the DOJ lawsuit</a> [press release], stating, "Arizona, Michigan and every other state have the authority to enforce immigration laws, and it is appalling to see President Obama use taxpayer dollars to stop a state's efforts to protect its own borders." The Arizona legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in April and is set to take effect July 29. 

<p>The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-brief-against-arizona-immigrations-law.php"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the federal district court in Arizona to block the enforcement of the state's immigration law. The brief was filed in support of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The Mexican government has also filed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mexico-asks-judge-to-strike-down-arizona-immigration-law.php"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] supporting the ACLU suit, claiming a substantial interest in ensuring its "bilateral diplomatic relations" with the US remain "transparent, consistent and reliable, and not frustrated by the actions of individual US states." The government also claims an interest in ensuring that its citizens are "accorded human and civil rights when present in the US in accordance with federal immigration law." Brewer is also currently facing federal lawsuits filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/lawsuits-challenge-arizona-immigration-law.php">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> and several <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Tuscon police officers</a> [JURIST reports], who claim they cannot properly implement the law without racially profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In ordering Lubanga's release, the ICC said that because the trial had been suspended, Lubanga could not be held indefinitely based on the assumption that his trial might resume at some point in the future. Lubanga's trial was suspended on the basis that he could not receive a fair trial until the defense received information about the identity of a witness known as "intermediary 143." The court previously indicated that the prosecution might be sanctioned under Article 71 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] for not complying with the court's ruling, but the court stated Thursday that sanctions will not be issued at this time. During its session, the court also granted the prosecutions leave to appeal the court's decision to stay the proceedings. Lubanga will remain in custody pending an appeal of the court's decision ordering his release. 

<p>Lubanga is accused of war crimes for allegedly recruiting child soldiers to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2002-2003. His trial began in January 2009 but was halted soon after when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST report] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] last July after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintains he is innocent</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against him. He became the first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC, formed in 2002, after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in March 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police say <a href="http://www.martindale.com/Prof-Jwani-Timothy-Mwaikusa/1281500-lawyer.htm">Jwani Mwaikusa</a> [Martindale profile] was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10649739">killed</a> [BBC report], along with his nephew and neighbor, and that the attackers then ransacked Mwaikusa's car, taking a briefcase and some documents. Mwaikusa worked as a defense counsel for former businessman Yussuf Munyakazi, who was <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/Case/English/Munyakazi/judgement/100630_summary.pdf">convicted</a> [judgment summary; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ictr-convicts-former-businessman-on-genocide-charges.php">report</a>] earlier this month on charges of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. Rwandan authorities had sought to have Munyakazi transferred to Rwanda for trial, but that request and the subsequent appeal were both <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ictr-upholds-decision-to-refuse.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] based on Mwaikusa's argument that his client couldn't get a fair trial there, because the judiciary in Rwanda may not be fully independent and immune from outside pressure. Mwaikusa lived outside of Tanzania's main city of Dar es Salaam, where he also taught law at the <a href="http://www.udsm.ac.tz/">University of Dar es Salaam</a> [official website]. It is unclear whether the shooting is related to Mwaikusa's work with the ICTR, as five people in Dar es Salaam have been shot dead by armed robbers in the last two months, a higher number than normal.

<p>This is not the first instance of an ICTR defense lawyer facing hostilities. Last month, US lawyer and JURIST <a href="/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erlinder">news archive</a>] returned to the US Tuesday after spending 21 days in a Rwandan prison. Erlinder was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he denied the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda%20genocide">news archive</a>]. He was in Rwanda to prepare his defense of opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://www.victoire2010.com/english/index.html">Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza</a> [campaign website], who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested in April</a> [JURIST report] on similar charges. Erlinder had pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-lawyer-pleads-not-guilty-to-rwanda-genocide-denial.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report]. Demanding Erlinder's release, more than 30 ICTR defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-defense-lawyers-call-for-release-of-us-lawyer-threaten-boycott.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/jun/08/statement-defence-rwanda-peter-erlinder">text</a>] last month, threatening a boycott. According to the statement, Erlinder's arrest indicated a growing threat to the country's legal system, because, "anyone who is involved in the defence of an accused person - be they counsel, investigator, assistant or Defense witness - runs the same risks and is exposed to the same threats of being criminally categorized as a 'negationist' as defined in Rwandan legislation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10650294">found guilty of treason</a> [BBC report] after the prosecution was able to sufficiently show that they had obtained arms and troops from Guinea in order to oust the government. In his closing statement, the state's chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j38dbLBXAD8pmbN1lTzyNE5HQyTw">urged the court to set an example</a> [AFP report] with the men in order to prevent future instability in the country.

Critics contend that Jammeh maintains stability in the Gambia by suppressing any signs of dissent. In March, an opposition official complained of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8561732.stm">frequent incidents of indefinite detention</a> [BBC report] of citizens, including government officials, without charges being filed. In February, Gambia <a href="http://www.afrol.com/articles/35356">ordered an envoy</a> [Afrol report] from <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] to leave the country.

The court, affirming a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/dc-court-rejects-attempt-to-put-law.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/superior/index.jsp">Superior Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website], found that DC's <a href="http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view,a,3,q,491858,ohrNav,%7C30953%7C.asp">Human Rights Act</a> (HRA) did not violate the <a href="http://www.abfa.com/ogc/tit4.htm">DC Charter</a> [texts] right to public referendum when it disallowed referendums on laws that would be discriminatory under the HRA. The appellants argued that the Charter, which acts as the district's constitution, allows public referendums on all legislative issues excepting appropriations and so the HRA exemption is invalid. Alternatively, they argued that a public referendum to bar the city from recognizing same-sex marriage would not be discriminatory. The court rejected both arguments, finding that the proposed ban would be discriminatory under the HRA due to its express prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court also found that the ability of the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/">Council of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to regulate what could be put to a vote under the Charter was ambiguous, requiring deference to the Council. Additionally, the court held, the Council could not have intended to allow issues of discrimination to go to a referendum because it approved both the HRA and the referendum amendment in the same legislative session. The dissenting judges agreed with the appellants, finding that the Council exceeded its authority under the Charter by seeking to restrict the right to referendum. In reacting to the decision, <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website] stated that it represented a "significant victory for justice, the rule of law and the protection of all D.C. residents against discrimination" and that individual civil rights <a href="http://www.hrc.org/14635.htm">should not be subject to referendums</a> [press release].

<p>In May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dc-circuit-hears-arguments-in-same-sex-marriage-appeal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] after the Superior Court denied Reverend Harry Jackson's request to allow a vote on a measure defining marriage as between a man and a woman. The case was heard <em>en banc</em> by all nine judges of the appeals court, instead of the three-judge panels that usually hear cases. The ruling affirmed a November decision by the <a href="http://www.dcboee.org/">District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics</a> [official website], which held that putting the act to a public vote would violate the HRA. DC began recognizing same-sex marriages in March after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">denied an emergency appeal</a> to block the law from taking effect, joining <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> [JURIST reports] in recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] also ordered Nemazee to pay $292 million in restitution to the banks that were the targets of the fraud. Nemazee spoke prior to the sentencing, stating that he <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704682604575368983972031848.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">takes responsibility for his crimes</a> [WSJ report] and blaming his conduct on pride and arrogance. Nemazee had previously <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-15/fundraiser-nemazee-gets-12-years-for-citi-hsbc-fraud.html">admitted to using forged documents</a> [Bloomberg report] in order to borrow from banks, starting in the 1990s. He originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/democratic-party-fundraiser-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] last September after being <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/documents/2009/09/hassan-nemazee-indictment.php?page=1">indicted</a> [text] on three counts of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. If the case had gone to trial, Nemzaee could have faced up to 30 years in prison for each charge of fraud. Nemazee, who was a fundraiser for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats, was ordered report to prison by August 27. 

<p>In May 2009, disgraced Democratic Party fundraiser <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hsu">Norman Hsu</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/democratic-party-fundraiser-convicted.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on charges of violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode02/usc_sup_01_2_10_14_20_I.html">Federal Elections Campaign Act</a> (FECA) [text]. Hsu was accused of making illegal campaign contributions in other peoples' names in violation of the FECA. According to the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/democratic-fundraiser-indicted-on-fraud.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report], Hsu also allegedly pressured clients to donate to his preferred democratic candidates and threatened to cut them off if they did not comply with his wishes. In September 2007, New York prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/democratic-fundraiser-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Hsu with orchestrating a $60 million Ponzi scheme in connection with the same events. Hsu <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/nyregion/08hsu.html?_r=1">pleaded guilty</a> [NYT report] to those fraud charges in May. The FBI arrested Hsu in Colorado on federal charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution after Hsu failed to appear for a bail hearing in California on unrelated fraud charges on September 5, 2007. Hsu formerly raised funds for political candidates, including Clinton. Clinton agreed to return $850,000 she received from Hsu when news of the charges became public. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission is comprised of <a href="http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/07/15/12423293.html">30 former government officials</a> [VOR report], human rights activists and professors, headed by former parliament speaker Abdygany Erkebayev.

The decree comes one week after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the Kyrgyz government requested that the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/07/kyrgyzstan-international-investigation-planned">conduct an international inquiry</a> [press release] into the violence. HRW urged OSCE to include the role of the Kyrgyz security forces in instigating and perpetrating the violence during the investigation, in addition to their conduct in the aftermath. On Wednesday, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/13/kyrgyzstan-torture-detentions-escalate-tensions">called for an end to the torture</a> [press release] and detention of Uzbeks believed to have been involved in the violence and urged the Kyrgyz government to abide by national and international law during the investigation. 

<p>The Kyrgyz government announced Friday that it has <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-opens-criminal-cases-following-ethnic-rioting.php">opened more than 1,000 criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] stemming from the recent violence. Regional officials in Osh, an area in southern Kyrgyzstan, announced that <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15305354&PageNum=0">106 individuals had already been detained</a> [ITAR-TASS report]. The violence resulted from a clash between the Kyrgyz majority and the Uzbek minority and official estimates place the death toll at 309, with an additional 2,000 reportedly injured. Property damage estimates exceed $71 million. The interim government <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/07/09/Kyrgyzstan-opens-1400-ethnic-riot-cases/UPI-34941278703090/">extended a curfew and state of emergency</a> [UPI report] in the area until August. A new <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">constitution took effect</a> in Kyrgyzstan earlier this month after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved by voters</a> [JURIST reports] in a nationwide referendum. In June, the interim government under Otunbayeva announced the referendum to reform the country's constitution <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kyrgyzstan-to-proceed-with-constitutional-referendum-despite-violence.php">would occur despite the ethnic violence</a> [JURIST report] in Osh. The constitution was originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-approves-draft-constitution.php">approved by the interim government</a> [JURIST report] in May. The June rioting in Osh followed violent protests in the capital city of Bishkek in April that resulted in former President Kurmanbek Bakiyev being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote on the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010 occurred after Democrats <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/109053-senate-passes-wall-st-reform">garnered the support</a> [<em>The Hill</em> report] of Republican Senators <a href="http://scottbrown.senate.gov/">Scott Brown</a> (MA), <a href="http://snowe.senate.gov/">Olympia Snowe</a> (ME) and <a href="http://collins.senate.gov/">Susan Collins</a> (ME) [official websites], securing the 60 votes needed to end debate. The legislation creates a new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent the companies from becoming "too big to fail" and will establish a new consumer protection division within the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] to enforce rules against abusive business practices. It also gives the Federal Reserve the power to supervise the largest financial companies and report to the government any risks the firms may pose to the economy at large. The government will have the ability to seize and liquidate failing financial institutions before their collapse can have an adverse economic effect, and the bill permits banks to invest only 3 percent of their capital into hedge funds or private equity funds. The bill also creates regulations for the trading of derivatives. Shortly after the Senate vote, <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/geithner-e.shtml">Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg777.htm">praised the reform package</a> [press release], stating:<blockquote>[The bill is] the strongest financial reform[] this country has considered since the Great Depression. ... [The] reforms will restore the banking system to its core purpose of helping Americans save for their future and channeling those savings to the entrepreneurs with the best ideas for building a stronger America. These reforms will allow the government to make sure that [banks] do not threaten the health of the economy as a whole.</blockquote>Just before the Senate vote, House <a href="http://gopleader.gov/default.aspx">Minority Leader John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] called for the law's repeal should it pass. In a <a href="http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=198442">statement</a> [text] released after the bill's passage, he explained why this was necessary:<blockquote>[The bill] makes bailouts permanent, enshrines 'too big to fail' into law, and fails to reform the government mortgage companies that sparked the meltdown by giving high-risk loans to people who couldn't afford it, and it needs to be fixed.  House Republicans offered a better solution to stop the Democrats' permanent bailouts, reform Fannie Mae &amp; Freddie Mac, and protect taxpayers and help small businesses create jobs.</blockquote>Obama is <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/congress-passes-bill-to-overhaul-financial-regulation/">expected to sign the bill</a> [NYT report] next week.

<p>Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-house-approves-financial-reform-legislation.php">voted 237-192</a> [JURIST report] to approve the financial reform bill. The House and Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-senate-reconcile-financial-reform-bills.php">reconciled their versions of the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month but were forced to re-open negotiations, eventually removing a $17.9 billion tax on large financial institutions that was meant to cover the bill's costs. The Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-senate-approves-financial-reform-legislation.php">approved its version</a> of the bill in May, after the House <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] in December. The legislation closely mirrors a proposal <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">put forth by the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] last June consisting of a broad series of regulatory reforms aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system following the recent <a href="http://www.ft.com/indepth/global-financial-crisis">economic crisis</a> [FT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=economic+crisis">news archive</a>]. Financial reform represents a cornerstone of Obama's legislative agenda since taking office in 2009, along with <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">health care</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=immigration+reform">immigration reform</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=climate+change">climate change legislation</a>, and the repeal of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don't+ask+don't+tell">"Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> [JURIST news archives].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Emmanuel was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/son-of-liberia-ex-leader-taylor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] last year to 97 years in prison after being <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-jury-convicts-son-of-liberia-ex.php">convicted</a> in 2008 on <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/us-grand-jury-indicts-son-of-former.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] that he was involved in torture and other crimes committed while he was the head of the paramilitary Anti-Terrorism Union (ATU), which tortured and killed opponents during the presidency of his father between 1997 and 2003. The court also upheld the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113C.html">1994 federal anti-torture statute</a> (the Torture Act) [18 USC &#167; 2340A text], under which Emmanuel was charged. Emmanuel was the first individual to be indicted under the statute and argued that the Torture Act exceeded Congressional authority because it criminalizes behavior of foreign government officials outside the territorial jurisdiction of the US. 

<p>In February, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/son-of-liberia-ex-president-ordered-to.php">ordered a final judgment of $22 million</a> [JURIST] in the civil case against Emmanuel, to be paid to five torture victims. Emmanuel, a US citizen raised in Boston, was arrested in Miami on a passport violation in 2006 and pleaded guilty in September of that year. He was then <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/us-grand-jury-indicts-son-of-former.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] on torture charges by a federal grand jury that December. He pleaded not guilty, and, in July 2008, a US District Court Judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-upholds-torture-charges.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the torture charges and rejected Emmanuel's constitutional argument. He was later <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-judge-denies-bail-for-son-of.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] on grounds that he was a flight risk and a danger to the community. Emmanuel's father, Taylor, is currently <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">on trial</a> [case website] before the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> [official website] sitting at The Hague.

Of the $550 million settlement, $300 million will be paid to the US Treasury and $250 million will be distributed to harmed investors. Additionally, Goldman agreed to implement a series of changes to its business practices and <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/press/press-releases/current/settlement.html">acknowledged</a> [press release] "that the marketing materials for the ... transaction contained incomplete information ... [and] regrets that the marketing materials did not contain [full] disclosure." In response to the penalty, SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/071510pressconference.wmv">said</a> [video]:<blockquote>This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing.</blockquote>The penalty, subject to the approval of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], is the largest against a financial company in SEC history. The SEC had <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sec-charges-goldman-sachs-with.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Goldman in April alleging securities fraud in regard to its conduct in marketing <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp">collateralized debt obligations</a> (CDOs) [Investopedia backgrounder] to investors in violation of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf">Securities Act of 1933</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF]. 

<p>The SEC action continues a trend in bringing action against financial corporations and their agents that engaged in allegedly illegal conduct at the start of the subprime mortgage downturn in 2007. In June, <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com/index.cfm?page=corp">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website] subsidiary Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. reached a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bank-of-america-subsidiary-reaches-108-million-settlement-with-ftc.php">$108 million settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to resolve charges that the subsidiary collected excessive fees from homeowners facing foreclosure. In February, a district court judge accepted a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-approves-150-million-sec.php">$150 million dollar settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] between BOA and the SEC. The SEC had <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/sec-charges-bank-of-america-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] BOA with misleading investors regarding billions of dollars paid to <a href="http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_15125">Merrill Lynch</a> [corporate website] executives during the acquisition of the firm. The judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-rejects-sec-bank-of.php">twice rejected a proposed settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the SEC and BOA for $33 million, which did not admit any fault or directly penalize any corporate executives, calling the settlement unfair to the shareholders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stewart was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-lawyer-convicted-of.php">convicted by a jury in 2005</a> [JURIST report] on charges of conspiracy, giving material support to terrorists and defrauding the US government for smuggling messages from convicted terrorist <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/923/000099626/">Omar Abdel-Rahman</a> [NNBD profile] to members of his militant <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/archive/wtc01/algamaa.htm">Islamic Group</a> [CNS backgrounder]. The <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/conviction-of-rights-lawyer-for.php">judgment was upheld</a> [JURIST reports] later that year, resulting in a <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/civil-rights-lawyer-lynne-stewart-gets.php">28-month prison sentence</a> [JURIST reports]. In re-sentencing Stewart, Judge John Koeltl of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/nyregion/16stewart.html?_r=1">cited statements she made</a> [NYT report] after her first sentence, which Koeltl said demonstrated her remorselessness. He also found that she had committed perjury during her trial. Koeltl ordered that Stewart, who suffers from breast cancer, be <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/07/15/new.york.lynne.stewart.resentenced/?fbid=Vroe5OPfvjs">transferred to a federal prison in Connecticut</a> [CNN report] due to her deteriorating health. After the sentencing, Stewart's husband described it as a death sentence.  

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/second-circuit-affirms-civil-rights.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] Stewart's conviction in 2009, but ordered the district court to reconsider her sentence, finding that the current 28-month sentence was "out of line with the extreme seriousness of her criminal conduct." As part of his conviction, Rahman is subject to Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), which limit his ability to communicate with individuals outside the prison. The court found that despite being a lawyer, Stewart was bound by the SAMs and knowingly and willfully lied about her intentions to comply. The court also found that Stewart provided and concealed material support to the conspiracy to murder persons in a foreign country. Federal prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/long-sentence-urged-for-rights-lawyer.php">sought the maximum sentence</a> [JURIST report] of 30 years, saying that Stewart's "egregious, flagrant abuse of her profession ... deserves to be severely punished."

Bybee was questioned by the committee in May in a closed-door hearing about controversial memos written by the OLC during the Bush administration, which asserted the legality of certain <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive]. The CIA subsequently used the enhanced interrogation techniques on prisoners at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] prison facility. According to Bybee, a number of the techniques, including repetitive <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], extended isolation, the use of blackout goggles and daily beatings, were not authorized by the OLC memos. Bybee admitted to authorizing limited use of waterboarding when performed in a specific way, but he contended that the manner in which the CIA used the technique went beyond the recommendations made in the memos. Bybee also stated that he believed the relationship between OLC lawyer <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>] and the Bush White House may have been "too close." Committee <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">Chairman John Coyners</a> (D-MI) [official website] indicated that Bybee's testimony would <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/100715.html">play a vital role</a> [press release] in the ongoing <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/doj-to-open-investigation-into-cia.php">investigation into detainee abuse</a> [JURIST report], stating:<blockquote>This testimony reveals that many brutal techniques reportedly used in CIA interrogations were not authorized by the Justice Department - the author of these legal memos has now admitted this on the record. These statements are highly relevant to the pending criminal investigation of detainee abuse and I have provided the Committee's interview to the Justice Department[.]</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/house-committee-releases-deposition-olc-torture-memo-author-jay-bybee">responded</a> [press release] to the release of Bybee's testimony by renewing their call for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/aclu-renews-calls-for-bush-era-detainee-torture-investigation.php">"comprehensive criminal investigation"</a> [JURIST report] into Bush administration torture policies. 

<p>As former head of the OLC, Bybee signed off on a memo, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">released last year</a> [JURIST report], authorizing the use of enhanced interrogation techniques as well as a controversial memo that defined torture as physical pain equivalent in "intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily functions, or even death." In January, Bybee and Yoo were cleared of allegations of wrongdoing in relation to the memos. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opr/">Office of Professional Responsibility</a> [official website] concluded that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-ethics-report-clears-bush.php">lawyers exercised poor judgment</a> [JURIST report] in crafting the 2002 memos, but that their actions did not reach the level of professional misconduct. Originally, the OPR investigation had concluded that Yoo and Bybee had violated their professional obligations in crafting the memos, but this finding was softened by the reviewer. Bybee had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/bybee-declines-senate-committee-request.php">declined a request</a> by a Senate committee to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/senate-judiciary-committee-chair-asks.php">testify about the interrogation memos</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement, reached in a meeting of the international diamond monitoring body, comes after the KP was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juEpejtbYrKpXFs55DVzyHAta7Nw">unable to reach a consensus</a> [AFP report] on Zimbabwe in its June meeting in Tel Aviv. Under the agreement, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/world/africa/17diamonds.html">KP will allow Zimbabwe to sell</a> [NYT report] a portion of its estimated USD $1.7 billion worth of mined diamonds before September, and the Zimbabwean government will allow KP experts to enter the country to certify that the diamond mines meet international standards. Diamonds sales after September will be contingent upon this certification. Civil society groups <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/">Global Watch</a> and <a href="http://www.pacweb.org/">Partnership Africa Canada</a> [advocacy websites], which have been critical of the Zimbabwean government's actions in the Marange mines, <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/1029/en/crisis_averted_by_last_minute_deal_on_zimbabwe_dia">expressed cautious optimism</a> [press release] following the deal, stating that it may help increase international oversight of the Zimbabwe diamond trade, but qualifying:<blockquote>Ultimately the success or otherwise of this agreement will be determined by what the main players do next. The ball is now in Zimbabwe's court to make good on its promises and act to end one of the most egregious cases of diamond-related violence for many years. We fervently hope that the governments in the Kimberley Process will, for their part, hold Zimbabwe to its commitments in order to begin to restore the battered integrity of the scheme.</blockquote>Zimbabwean <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7881582.stm">Finance Minister Tendai Biti</a> [BBC profile] said Tuesday that although the KP has indicated that USD $30 million has been generated by the sale of Marange diamonds, the <a href="http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-2844-Diamond+sale+proceeds+diverted/news.aspx">government has no record of it</a> [<em>New Zimbabwe</em> report], suggesting the revenue may of have been diverted. Biti is a member of the opposition <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website], which is currently in a power-sharing agreement with <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/africa/july-dec08/mugabe_12-12.html">President Robert Mugabe</a> [PBS profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=robert+mugabe">news archive</a>] after the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+election">2008 elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. 

<p>The agreement comes the same week as human rights activist Farai Maguwu was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/zimbabwe-court-grants-bail-to-rights-activist-investigating-conflict-diamonds.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] by a Zimbabwean court. Maguwu was being held for allegedly supplying false information about Zimbabwe's diamond mining practices to the KP. In June, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the body to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/diamond-monitoring-body-urged-to-suspend-zimbabwe-over-rights-abuse-allegations.php">remove Zimbabwe</a> [JURIST report] from its membership. According to HRW, human rights abuses by the Zimbabwean government have persisted since the discovery of diamonds in the Marange fields. Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada have also called for the suspension of Zimbabwe's international diamond trade <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/6486414/Kimberley-Process-considers-ban-on-Zimbabwe-diamond-exports.html">due to the human rights violations</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] allegedly committed by the Zimbabwean army against civilians and illegal workers in the Marange diamond fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/kgb.htm">KGB</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], predecessor to the FSB, had the authority to conduct similar preemptive questioning, which was often used to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/world/europe/17russia.html">intimidate dissidents</a> [NYT report] in the USSR. Under the proposed legislation, the FSB could, without evidence, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5808663,00.html">question and warn citizens</a> [DW report] about the possible commission of future crimes, although the final bill falls short of punishing individuals who ignore the FSB warnings. Rights groups and members of the Russian legal community have <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/news/F26E6AA">condemned the law</a> [press release, in Russian] saying that it legalizes arbitrary detentions by the FSB and that it extends the scope of the FSB beyond its authority. Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/medvedev-warns-west-not-to-meddle-in-fsb-bill/410478.html">indicated that he supports the bill</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] and has warned against international interference in Russian lawmaking. The bill must now be approved by the Russian <a href="http://council.gov.ru/index.html">Federation Council</a> [official website, in Russian] before Medvedev can sign it into law. 

<p>Russia continues facing criticism from the international community regarding its human rights record. In October, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sova-center.ru/en/xenophobia/news-releases/2009/10/d17243/">issued a report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-report-criticizes-russia-on-human.php">report</a>] criticizing Russia's record on human rights and calling on the country to take extensive legal reform in order to guarantee its citizens rights such as fair trials and freedoms of speech and of the press. Last June, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-judicial-reform-urged-by-council.php">urged substantial reforms</a> [JURIST report] to correct systemic problems in the Russian legal system, including the prevalence of political prosecutions and a lack of judicial independence. Medvedev has <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">acknowledged the need for judicial reform</a> [JURIST report], saying that transparent courts would restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from seeking redress in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Xue was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-court-convicts-us-geologist-for-selling-state-secrets.php">convicted earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://bj1zy.chinacourt.org/">Beijing's No.1 Intermediate People's Court</a> [official website] and sentenced to eight years in prison for collecting intelligence and illegally providing state secrets. The court stated that Xue received a database containing the coordinates for oil wells owned by the <a href="http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/">China National Petroleum Corporation</a> [official website] while conducting research for US-based IHS energy. Upon discovery, Xue <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gE6zSxI_SVZeYhKBsZD4BN2K34HAD9GOV4J00">agreed to sell the database to IHS</a> [AP report], which the court ruled was illegal under China's controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+state+secrets">state secrets</a> [JURIST news archive] law. The database was allegedly made available to the public and only considered classified after its sale. In addition to filing an appeal over the classification of the information as a state secret, Xue's attorney is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704682604575370210792773320.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">also appealing his sentence</a> [WSJ report], arguing that the prison term as well as a 200,000 yuan fine was too harsh. The US has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gE6zSxI_SVZeYhKBsZD4BN2K34HAD9H05MJ80">working through diplomatic channels</a> [AP report] in order to obtain Xue's release, but so far has had little success. 

<p>China's state secrets law has frequently been criticized for alleged overbreadth. In November, rights activist Huang Qi was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-human-rights-activist-huang-qi.php">sentenced to three years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for violating the state secrets law when he discussed how some schools collapsed after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2008/china_quake/default.stm">Sichuan province earthquake</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2008 because of shoddy construction. In March, four employees of Australian mining company <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> [corporate website] were convicted of <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-court-convicts-australia-mining.php">receiving bribes and stealing commercial secrets</a> [JURIST report] during stalled iron ore price negotiations and sentenced to a range of seven to 14 years in prison. In April, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/china-amends-state-secrets-law-to.php">revised the state secrets law</a> [JURIST report] to require Internet and telecommunications companies to inform on customers who share state secrets. China <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-lawmakers-review-revised-state.php">began a review</a> of its state secrets law last June after concerns were raised regarding <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-official-affirms-that.php">Internet filtering software</a> [JURIST reports] on computers sold in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/91583">"A Wasted Decade"</a> [materials], released a day in advance of the 10-year anniversary of al-Asad's rise to power, HRW sharply criticized the human rights situation in the country today. Despite continued promises of reform and a brief period of eased restrictions on political activity, the report concludes that there has been no improvement in the country's human rights record. HRW cited the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/syria-court-sentences-lawyer-for-campaigning-against-military-rule.php">conviction of lawyer and human rights activist Haitham Maleh</a> [JURIST report] for campaigning against the emergency rule as a recent example of this rights situation. HRW called for an end to the emergency rule, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/016/2004/en/a1159cd1-d60d-11dd-bb24-1fb85fe8fa05/mde240162004en.html">in place since 1963</a> [AI backgrounder], which it said violates the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. The rights organization also called for an end to Internet and media censorship and warrantless detentions and torture, calling for the Syrian government to allow detainees access to counsel and to ratify the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat-one.htm">Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture</a> [text]. The report urges the government to recognize the Kurdish minority's right to its culture and to resolve the status of 300,000 Kurds and their descendants who were stripped of their Syrian citizenship in 1962 and remain stateless. The only time in which any progress was made, according to HRW, was shortly after al-Asad ascended to the presidency during the so-called "Damascus Spring." During this period, groups advocating political reform were allowed to organize, political prisoners were released and prisons were shut down. This period ended abruptly in 2001, however, as the government resumed the repression of dissidents. 

<p>Over the past several years, Syria has increased its prosecution of political dissidents, drawing strong criticism from the international community. Earlier this month, a Syrian military court sentenced <a href="http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/syr060313-redirected">Haitham Maleh</a> [RNW profile] to three years in prison for "weakening national morale." The 78-year-old former judge was put on trial in October 2009 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-detention-haitham-maleh">sparking criticism from the US government</a> [press release] and several human rights groups. In October 2008 a Damascus criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/syria-court-sentences-dissidents.php">sentenced 12 dissidents</a> [JURIST report] found guilty on charges of weakening national sentiment, broadcasting false or exaggerated news that could affect the morale of the country, joining an organization formed with the purpose of changing the financial or social status of the state and inciting sectarian strife. In January 2008, the Syrian government <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/01/syria-arrests-pro-democracy-former.php">arrested former parliamentarian</a> [JURIST report] and dissident Riyad Sayf, a prominent member of the "Damascus Declaration" group, which, in 2005, issued a declaration urging Syria to embark on democratic transition and improve relations with Lebanon. In 2007, a Syrian court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/syria-court-sentences-dissidents-for.php">sentenced writer and activist Michel Kilo</a> [JURIST report] to a prison term of three years for "speaking false news, weakening national feeling and inciting sectarian sentiments."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In ordering the fines, the judge said the companies had shown, "a slackness, inefficiency and a more or less complacent attitude to safety." An <a href="http://www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk/reports/index.htm#final">investigation into the Buncefield explosion</a> [materials] found that a series of safety lapses by the companies resulted in the release of thousands of gallons of oil that formed a vapor cloud. The cloud ignited causing an explosion that injured 43 and caused widespread damage to local businesses. The offices of the <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/">Health and Safety Executive</a> (HSE) and the <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/">Environment Agency</a> [official websites] conducted the joint investigation into the incident and <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/news/buncefield/statement-steps.htm">issued a statement</a> [press release] urging corporations to act responsibly: <blockquote>Society rightly demands the highest of standards from the high hazard industries. The risks created by these businesses must be managed effectively because when things go wrong in this sector, the consequences are severe and can destroy lives, shatter local communities and cause damage to the environment that lasts for generations. ...From the Board room down companies must ask themselves these questions: do we understand what could go wrong; do we know what our systems are to prevent this happening; and are we getting the right information to assure us they are working effectively.</blockquote>The court also levied fines against Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd, Motherwell Control Systems 2003 Ltd and British Pipeline Agency Ltd. 

<p>Total oil has recently faced a series of high-profile legal challenges. In April, a French judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-oil-company-charged-with.php">charged Total with bribery and complicity</a> [JURIST report] in connection with a scandal involving the UN's <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/">Iraq Oil-for-Food program</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/oilforfood.php">news archive</a>]. The company denied the allegations, stating that the company <a href="http://www.total.com/MEDIAS/MEDIAS_INFOS/3242/EN/Total-2009-document-reference-va.pdf">followed UN policy and acted lawfully</a> [text, PDF]. In March, the <a href="http://www.ca-paris.justice.fr/index.php">Paris Appellate Court</a> [official website, in French] upheld a lower court's 2008 decision finding Total and several other defendants <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-appeals-upholds-oil-company.php">criminally liable for an oil spill</a> [JURIST report] that occurred of the coast of Brittany in 1999. The court also increased the fine against the defendants from 192 million euros to 200 million euros. Over <a href="http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/30/court-confirms-total-oil-spill-verdict/">20,000 tons of oil</a> [Euronews report] seeped from an oil tanker called Erika, which Total chartered from an Italian company, decimating 400 kilometers of coastline and causing harm to wildlife.

The ruling, which also reaffirms a previous ruling <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">finding the land reform program to be racially motivated</a> [JURIST report], discriminatory and contrary to the SADC <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/press%20releases/SADCTreaty.doc">treaty</a> [text, DOC], marks the third time that the Tribunal has referred Zimbabwe to the SADC summit meeting for non-compliance with court orders, continued human rights abuses and violation of the SADC treaty. The summit has yet to act in any of these instances. In bringing the case to the Tribunal, the farmers <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g9R-TCg1bwBce_yC_40wUd4qVAEA">urged SADC to suspend Zimbabwe</a> [AFP report] from its membership until it either halted the seizures or compensated the farmers, as previously ordered by the Tribunal. The farmers have alleged that they face ongoing violence and harassment by government forces that seek to evict them from their farmland. After the ruling, the farmers' lawyer <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/namibiaNews/idAFLDE66F0ZZ20100716?sp=true">described Zimbabwe as a rogue state</a> [Reuters report] that disregards human rights. The farmers' lawyer also asserted that if SADC does not take action against Zimbabwe this year, the organization's legitimacy will be greatly undermined. Zimbabwean <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/africa/july-dec08/mugabe_12-12.html">President Robert Mugabe</a> [PBS profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=robert+mugabe">news archive</a>] has defended the law, calling it necessary to correct historical racial disparities resulting from the country's history as a British colony.Those familiar with the regional organization have expressed skepticism at the prospect of SADC taking action against Zimbabwe this year.

<p>In January, the Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/zimbabwe.htm">High Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/zimbabwe-high-court-refuses-to-register.php">ruled that it is not bound</a> [JURIST report] by the Tribunal's decision ordering the state to halt its land reforms, refusing to register it. Justice Bharat Patel stated that enforcing the ruling, which was in favor of white farmers whose land was <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">taken over in the government's farm redistribution program</a> [JURIST report], would violate the Zimbabwean <a href="http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and would be against public policy. Patel believed that a decision in favor the SADC ruling would lead to the removal of the majority of the people that the government was trying to support through the redistribution program. The High Court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/zimbabwe-high-court-invalidates.php">ruled that the Tribunal is not superior</a> [JURIST report] to the courts of the individual SADC member countries. In December 2008, four white Zimbabwe farmers were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-defies-regional-court-charges.php">charged with trespassing</a> [JURIST report] on state property for failing to vacate lands that the government seized for the land reform program, in open defiance of the November 2008 Tribunal ruling. One of the farmers, Colin Cloete, filed suit to cause the government and attorney general to register the SADC ruling in the High Court Registry, a step necessary to enable its enforcement in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=A11177%09%09&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Votes=Y&Memo=Y&Text=Y">law</a> [A 11177A materials] was approved by the <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/">New York Assembly</a> [official website] last month and will end the practice of police obtaining and keeping an electronic record of all individuals who are temporarily detained based on a police officer's reasonable suspicion. Opponents of the law, including New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website], argue that the current database has been an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gVCtfgMAmDVhTI6KLFVp5nLzrTXw">important crime fighting tool</a> [AFP report] for police officers in New York City, crediting the database with a significant decrease in crime. Paterson stated that the law was consistent with the state's <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/criminal-procedure/CPL0160.50_160.50.html">Criminal Procedure Laws</a> [&#167; 160.50 text] and with societal principles of justice, stating:<blockquote>There is a principle - which is compatible with the presumption of innocence, and is deeply ingrained in our sense of justice - that individuals wrongly accused of a crime should suffer neither stigma nor adverse consequences by virtue of an arrest or criminal accusation not resulting in conviction. ... Those accused of a crime are permitted to have their records sealed upon the dismissal of the charges. Therefore, simple justice as well as common sense suggest that those questioned by police and not even accused of a crime should not be subjected to perpetual suspicion.</blockquote>In 2009, New York City police officers <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gucDDJfBee4v1X_-35rrwnAxz9uAD9H09EPG1">obtained information from more than 500,000 individuals</a> [AP report], primarily minorities, as a result "stop and frisk" detentions. 

<p>"Stop and frisk" detentions are considered an exception to the warrant requirement of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text], based on an officer's reasonable suspicion and the necessity to protect the safety of police officers. Courts continue developing the case law surrounding the Fourth Amendment, balancing privacy issues against social necessity. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1332">City of Ontario v. Quon</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an employer's search of private text messages on a work-issued device does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the search is motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and is not excessive in scope. In February, a US court of appeals <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/02/08/05-17080.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-inmate.php">report</a>] that strip searching all incoming inmates does not violate the Fourth Amendment because it is necessary in order to prevent illegal substances from entering prisons. The <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in December that a warrantless search of the contents of a suspect's cell phone <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">violates the Fourth Amendment</a> [JURIST report] prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, unless the search is necessary to protect the officers' safety or there are other exigent circumstances </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was brought by 102 Iraqi men who claim they were subjected torture, including hooding, electrical shocks and sexual abuse, while being held in 14 UK military detention centers in Iraq from 2003 through 2008. The court held that there was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2010/jul/16/army-torture-iraq-judicial-review">sufficient evidence presented</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] by the men to argue that their treatment had been systemic, raising questions of government authorization or complicity. The men contend that Defense Secretary Liam Fox had a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJF6lunPSjbUIvXy-u3Xw19jEygw">duty to conduct an independent investigation</a> [AFP report] into the torture allegations. Fox opted not to conduct such an inquiry, instead establishing the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which will consist of military police and civilian investigators under civilian leadership. The government argued that the suit should be suspended because of IHAT's establishment, which it said would provide a more effective means of investigating the torture allegations than a public inquiry. The court held that it could be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iM39X-lyVlAIbMX2cX4KWP5vio-w">argued that IHAT would not be effective</a> [UKPA report] in investigating allegations of systemic torture. The case will now move to a full hearing. 

<p>Last week, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">announced that he will create a panel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate claims that British government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas. The inquiry comes after 12 ex-detainees brought civil cases against the government, claiming that British agents took part in their mistreatment while they were held in prisons in foreign countries, including Pakistan and Morocco. The UK will ask the ex-detainees to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j536v6m_aIZbuEF2Ntf8mDy2hnUAD9GPLFS80">drop their lawsuits</a> [AP report] in exchange for possible compensation and a promise that the inquiry will fully investigate their claims. Cameron said that he hopes to start the investigation by the end of the year, once a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uk-court-rules-evidence-may-be-kept.php">separate investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of MI5 and MI6 agents at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] concludes, and to have a full report back within the next 12 months. It has yet to be determined whether parts of the investigation will be held publicly. The UK government indicated last month that it will issue a new set of regulations regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">use of information obtained via torture</a> [JURIST report]. Claims of complicity in torture were made against the government in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/06/28/no-questions-asked-0">report</a> [materials] released last week by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. According to HRW, intelligence services in France, Germany and the UK lack proper oversight of intelligence information that is received from countries that torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/1F4EF726-084A-4301-B78B-2EC0431162C6.htm">order was issued</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-orders-release-of-congo-militia-leader-lubanga-pending-appeal.php">report</a>] on Thursday after the court determined that Lubanga could not be detained for an indeterminate period of time pending resumption of his trial. The court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-suspends-trial-of-congo-militia-leader-lubanga.php">ordered a stay</a> [JURIST report] in the proceedings until the prosecution complied with an order to provide certain information to the defense. In the appeal, the prosecutor focused on the unlikelihood that Lubanga could be located and re-detained upon resumption of the trial:<blockquote>Throughout these proceedings, the accused has been detained on the basis of repeated findings that his detention is necessary to ensure his appearance at trial, and that there exists "the real possibility that the Court is likely to be unable to ensure the Accused's presence at trial if he is released" - a finding referred to by this Chamber in an earlier appeal on realease [sic].	In its Decision on Release, the Chamber did not purport to conclude that the risk of flight has abated or indeed address risk of flight at all. Thus, the previous findings regarding the possibility of flight are undisputed and undiminished.</blockquote>The prosecutor indicated that an appeal of the order staying the proceedings is forthcoming.

<p>Lubanga is accused of war crimes for allegedly recruiting child soldiers to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2002-2003. His trial began in January 2009 but was halted soon after when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST report] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] last July after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintains he is innocent</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against him. He became the first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC, formed in 2002, after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in March 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The PMOI has been designated a foreign terrorist group by the US since 1997, but it argues that it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071605881.html">stopped military action in 2001</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report], and since 2003 has been without weapons. The group has also touted its actions in providing information about Iran's nuclear program. The State Department has argued that the PMOI still engages in military action and that the information it provided about Iran's nuclear program was not reliable. In its decision, the panel took issue with how the State Department provided information to PMOI as to why it continued to be included on a list of foreign terrorist organizations, saying:<blockquote>The PMOI was notified of the Secretary's decision and permitted access to the unclassified portion of the record only after the decision was final. And even though the PMOI was given the opportunity to include in the record its own evidence supporting delisting, it had no opportunity to rebut the unclassified portion of the record the Secretary was compiling&#8212;an omission, the PMOI argues, that deprived it of the due process protections detailed in our previous decisions.</blockquote> If the PMOI is removed from the State Department's list of terrorist groups, it will be able to raise funds and would not be subject to having its assets frozen by the US. The State Department did not immediately indicate whether it would appeal the ruling.

<p>In 2008, the European Court of First Instance <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-reverses-eu-decision-to.php">annulled a decision by the EU</a> [JURIST] to place the PMOI on a list of terrorist groups. That decision followed an <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-parliament-removes-iranian-group.php">order by the UK Parliament</a> [JURIST report] to remove the PMOI from a British list of terrorist groups. PMOI is Iran's main political opposition organization and part of the <a href="http://www.ncr-iran.org/">National Council of Resistance of Iran</a> (NCRI) [group website], an umbrella coalition of Iranian opposition groups. The PMOI has been at odds with the Iranian government since it chose to support Saddam Hussein in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm">Iran-Iraq war</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] during the 1980s.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nicholas Hawton, a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website], stated that the panel ruled that the presented evidence of Asllani's involvement was insufficient and that the countries <a href="http://dailyme.com/story/2010071700002323/judges-extradite-kosovo-terror-suspect.html">lack a standing extradition agreement</a> [AP report]. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nce/">US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina</a> [official website] had based its request on an October 1901 treaty signed by the US and the former Kingdom of Serbia, but the panel found that the charges Asllani faces do not fall within the agreement's terms. Asllani was released following the judges' ruling.

<p>Last month, US officials <a href="http://charlotte.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ch061710.htm">charged</a> [press release] Asllani with providing support to terrorists and conspiring to murder and harm people abroad.

The 5-3 decision leaves in place a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/CADC-Mohammed-ruling-7-8-10.pdf">ruling</a> [order, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], in which the government asserted that Mohammed's return to Algeria was permissible because there was not credible evidence that he would face torture upon his arrival. Mohammed may appeal, though it is possible that he will have been returned to Algeria by that time. Later Friday, the court similarly <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Naji-denial-7-16-10.pdf">rejected</a> [order, PDF] the request of a second Algerian, Abdul Aziz Naji, to review his pending transfer. 

<p>The court's refusal to hear the cases lends credence to the circuit court's decision to rely upon <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/munvger">Munaf v. Green</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/dnp-supreme-court-considers-war-on.php">report</a>] in affirming the government's decision over that of a federal judge. <u>Munaf</u> granted the government the authority to transfer detainees to the country where their crimes are alleged to have been committed as a means by which to show deference to that country's ability to enforce its laws. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Mohammed's release in November. Judge Gladys Kessler of the US District Court for the District of Columbia directed the government to "take all necessary and appropriate steps to facilitate [Fari Saeed's] release forthwith." The order resulted from a civil action brought against the US government for unlawfully detaining him since 2002.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontburka.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/ministers11/damian-green/">Immigration Minister Damian Green</a> [official profile] indicated in an interview Sunday that Britain's coalition government would not seek or support a British law banning the wearing of the Islamic <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] or other face coverings in public. Green stated that banning the burqa would <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7896751/Burka-ban-ruled-out-by-immigration-minister.html">not be consistent with British society</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], where mutual respect for differences among cultures is important. Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-parliament-to-consider-bill-banning-face-veils.php">legislation was introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website] that would ban the wearing of the burqa or other face coverings in public. The <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/facecoveringsregulation.html">Face Coverings (Regulation) Bill</a> [materials] was introduced by <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/philip-hollobone/31683">MP Philip Hollobone</a> [official website] in order to regulate the covering of the face in public and, if passed, would prohibit the wearing of both the burqa and the niqab. Green stated that the bill was unlikely to pass and that the government had little interest in telling citizens what they are allowed to wear in public. Also on Sunday, the Spanish opposition <a href="http://www.pp.es/">Popular Party</a> (PP) [party website, in Spanish] announced that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iXTeJXk6d0HDxNRKn-1F_PM0GvSgD9H1HD6G1">debate will begin</a> [AP report] over a Spanish burqa ban in the lower house of the parliament, the <a href="http://www.congreso.es/">Congress of Deputies</a> [official website, in Spanish], on Tuesday. The plans for a Spanish burqa ban were first <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/spain-to-include-burqa-ban-in-religious-freedom-bill.php">announced last month</a> [JURIST report] by Spanish <a href="http://www.mjusticia.es/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1246950586360&lang=es_es&menu_activo=1246950586360&pagename=Portal_del_ciudadano%2FPage%2FOrganizacionMJ">Justice Minister Francisco Caamano</a> [official profile, in Spanish] and will be included in Spain's Religious Freedom Bill, which would also prohibit religious symbols, such as crucifixes, in state-owned buildings. The Spanish burqa ban appears to have strong support from both the ruling and opposition parties. In June, the Spanish <a href="http://www.senado.es/">Senate</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.senado.es/cgi-bin/verNoticia?IDITEM=486">approved a motion</a> [press release, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/spain-senate-calls-for-government-ban-of-face-veils.php">report</a>] calling on the Spanish government to ban the use of full face veils in public places. The proposed Spanish burqa ban is expected to become law unless ruled unconstitutional by the Spanish <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/Paginas/Home.aspx">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish]. 

<p>Last week, the French government moved closer to implementing a law that would make it illegal to wear the burqa or other full face veils in public. The French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">approved by a vote of 336 to one</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">legislation</a> [materials, in French] that would give police the authority to require women wearing the veils to show their face, and, if they refuse, they could be forced to attend citizenship classes or be charged a USD $185 fine. The proposed legislation would also make it a crime to force a woman to cover her face, with a penalty of one year in prison and a fine of USD $18,555. The National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-begins-debate-on-bill-to-ban-burqa.php">began debate on the bill</a> earlier this month, after the French cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/france-cabinent-approves-legislation-to-ban-burqa.php">approved the legislation</a> [JURIST reports] in May. The bill will now proceed to a vote in the <a href="http://www.senat.fr/index.html">Senate</a> [official website, in French], which is currently scheduled for September. Similar legislation is also being considered in Belgium, where, in April, the Belgian House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/belgium-lower-house-approves-burqa-ban.php">voted 136-0 to approve</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would ban the burqa and other full face veils in public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khadr <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4l6RRZ7aHdcN0M3TH3QNk5CA_Zw">fired his US civilian lawyers</a> [AFP report] earlier this month and requested that his US military lawyer be fired as well. Judge Patrick Parrish denied Khadr's request and ordered US Army Lt-Col. Jon Jackson to remain Khadr's lawyer and provide him with a defense at trial. Jackson initially questioned the ethical implications of defending a suspect who <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/07/17/14746741.html">does not wish to provide a defense</a> [<em>Toronto Sun</em> report], but ultimately concluded that he was ethically bound to provide a zealous defense for Khadr. At a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-tells-court-he-previously-rejected-plea-deal.php">pre-trial hearing held last week</a> [JURIST report], Khadr informed the court that he had previously rejected a plea deal offered by the US government, which would have resulted in a five-year prison sentence. Khadr told the court that the agreement was a ploy by the US government to look good in the eyes of the international community and that he would not be used to achieve US goals. He also said the agreement would have been used to <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE66B4AS20100712?sp=true">excuse the torture and abuse of a child</a> [Reuters report]. Khadr also informed the court that he did not wish to mount a defense at trial because he believed the outcome would be the same regardless of his defense and that he had no hope of obtaining justice through the legal process. Khadr is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">facing murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed one US soldier and injured another. If he is found guilty, he could face a sentence of life in prison. 

<p>Khadr's defense lawyers have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/canada-court-orders-pm-to-request.php">repeatedly sought his repatriation</a> [JURIST report] to Canada on the basis that the Canadian government's refusal to request repatriation from the US violates the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. The Harper administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">announced in February</a> that they would not pursue Khadr's repatriation, after the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the government was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">not obligated to seek his return</a> [JURIST reports] to Canada despite having his Charter rights violated. In May, a UN official called on the US and Canada to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-calls-for-khadrs-release-to-canada.php">respect international conventions</a> [JURIST report] and release Khadr into Canadian custody. The UN claimed that since Khadr was 15 when he was captured, his detention would fall in line with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], which has been ratified by Canada, but not the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement. made last week, came as states have begun accepting applications for the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/about/provisions/pcip/index.html">Pre-Existing Insurance Plan</a> (PCIP) [official website], a key component of the recently passed <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [HR 3590 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">report</a>], which will allow people who have been denied insurance coverage due to pre-existing conditions to purchase coverage at the same rate as those without pre-existing conditions. The program will be administered by the states. Controversy arose over the issue after New Mexico and Pennsylvania initially announced that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ig2n-N48bvgGAWA-wHlMPQpOdinQD9H1VME80">elective abortions would be funded</a> [AP report] under their states' high-risk plans. In a press release the DHHS emphasized that an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-acts-consistency-with-longst">executive order</a> [text], signed by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] after the passage of the health care reform bill, prohibits federal funding of abortions at both the state and federal level effectively prohibiting PCIPs from covering elective abortions. Pro-life advocates <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/us-bishops-welcome-hhs-statement-on-abortion-coverage-express-grave-concern/">welcomed the statement from the DHHS</a> [CNA/EWTN report], but urged Congress to take more permanent steps to ensure that federal funds will not be spent on abortions. The pro-choice advocacy group <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/index.html">NARAL Pro-Choice America</a> (NARAL) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/news/press-releases/2010/0707152010_obamaexcludeabortionhcr.html">called the decision "inexplicable"</a> [press release], stating that it was unacceptable to classify abortion differently than other standard medical procedures. 

<p>Abortion remains a controversial issue at both the state and federal levels. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-blocks-enforcement-of-nebraska-abortion-law.php">report</a>] preventing <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=6605">a new Nebraska abortion law</a> [LB 594 materials] from being enforced. The law would require physicians to evaluate the mental health of the woman seeking the abortion and to <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB594.pdf">inform the patient of all risk factors and complications</a> [LB 594 text] statistically associated with the procedure. Last month, Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Charlie Crist</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. In May, Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. In April, the Nebraska legislature approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">prohibiting abortions at or past 20 weeks</a> [JURIST report] on the theory that a fetus can allegedly feel pain following that point.

The German government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">agreed to take the detainees</a> [JURIST report] after negotiations with the Obama administration. Rhineland-Palatinate <a href="http://www.ism.rlp.de/">Interior Minister Karl Peter Bruch</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5814517,00.html">did not name the closed facility</a> [DW report] in which the detainees would be held after their arrival in September, but stated that they would remain there at least a year before being released into the the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hamburg. During that time, they will be undergo psychological analysis, receive German language training and be observed by doctors and social workers. Once they are released, they will receive what has been described as intensive integration assistance from their host states, and following this they will be <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,705955,00.html">granted permanent residency permits</a> [<em>Der Spiegel</em> report] that will allow them to live and travel anywhere in the EU. The terms for their release from the facility are to be set Monday. German critics of the plan, including opposition lawmakers and police unions, have argued that their presence could radicalize the Muslim population within the country and pose security problems. Bruch, along with other US and German officials have denied that, arguing that the detainees would not pose any security threats. 

<p>German <a href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/cln_174/DE/Ministerium/ministerium_node.html">Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere</a> [official website, in German] announced earlier this month that Germany would accept two detainees from Guantanamo. The Obama administration had originally asked Germany to <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/us-asking-germany-to-accept-10.php">take up to 10 detainees</a> [JURIST report] from the facility. De Maiziere emphasized at the time that Germany had informed the US it would <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5770374,00.html">not consider any further requests</a> [DW report] to accept detainees. There are currently 181 detainees remaining at the Guantanamo facility. The Obama administration continues its push to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, despite <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">missing its self-imposed one-year deadline</a> [JURIST report] in January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to his lawyer, Aziz will now stand trial on charges of <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/07/2010718194535925679.html">squandering public funds</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Aziz's lawyer contends that he has been denied access to his client and that the current Iraqi government is attempting to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gqa8mz4z-y_JqpZHtZRZWXIElUzA">find a reason to execute Aziz</a> [AFP report]. The new charges were filed less than a week after the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-transfers-26-saddam-era-officials-to-iraqi-custody.php">transferred 26 Saddam-era Iraqi officials</a> [JURIST report], including Aziz, from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Camp+Cropper">Camp Cropper</a> [JURIST news archive] to the Iraqi-controlled Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad. Aziz has said he <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD9GUUVDO0">he fears for his life</a> [AP report] while in the custody of the current Iraqi government and plans to appeal to the Vatican to intervene on his behalf. Aziz's family has called for his release on health grounds, claiming he has had two heart attacks and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/imprisoned-saddam-era-iraqi-foreign.php">suffered a stroke</a> [JURIST report] in January. In August 2009, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-court-convicts-top-saddam.php">convicted of forcing Kurdish displacement</a> [JURIST report] from northeast Iraq during the late 1980s, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. In March 2009, Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-sentences-top-saddam.php">sentenced to 15 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for the 1992 murders of 42 merchants accused of price-gouging during a period of UN-imposed sanctions. The US continues to hold eight Saddam-era officials at the request of the Iraqi government. 

<p>Camp Cropper, the last US-run detention facility in Iraq, and the 1,600 prisoners held there were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle+east-10642960">transferred to the Iraqi government</a> [BBC report] on Thursday. In March, the US military <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-control-of-camp-taji.php">transferred Camp Taji prison</a> [JURIST report] to Iraqi authorities. The US began to scale back its Iraq detention facilities in September when <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bucca">Camp Bucca</a> [JURIST news archive] in southern Iraq was <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-closes-controversial-camp-bucca.php">closed</a> [JURIST report] pursuant to the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> [text, PDF]. According to the agreement, all US troops must be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of 2011, and the US must release all prisoners or transfer them to the control of Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government must have arrest warrants or detention orders to accept transferred prisoners into Iraqi facilities, otherwise risking release. A fourth US-run prison, <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">transferred back to Iraqi control</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. The Iraqi government has recently faced criticism for its treatment of prisoners from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. In April, the rights group claimed that <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">Iraqi detainees were repeatedly tortured</a> [JURIST report] in a secret prison in Baghdad. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/israel-legislature-adopts-mesure-to.php">passed in January</a> [JURIST report], prevents the prosecution or suspends the sentences of those who were arrested for protesting Israel's 2005 withdrawal from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5122404.stm">Gaza Strip</a> [BBC backgrounder]. During the disengagement, the Israeli government dismantled 21 Jewish settlements in Gaza and four in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/palestine/west-bank.htm">West Bank</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], demolished residential buildings and evacuated all security personnel. The plan sparked nationwide protests in which hundreds of thousands participated. In ordering the 90-day injunction, the court <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/state-has-90-days-to-justify-amnesty-law-for-gaza-pullout-protesters-1.302607">ordered the government to explain the law</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report], otherwise it would be struck down permanently. The court ruled that the amnesty law is inequitable because it favors one group of protesters, while other protesters opposing other government policies are still prosecuted. The ruling came in response to a petition by a group of left-wing protesters arrested while opposing the evacuation Palestinians from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/jerusalem.htm">East Jerusalem</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. The petitioners claimed that the amnesty law discriminates against them because they still must face prosecution while protesters of an opposing ideology do not. 

<p>The Israeli <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/">Knesset</a> [official website, in Hebrew] approved the amnesty law in January. The amnesty measure, which <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-to-expunge-criminal-records-of-400-gaza-pullout-opponents-1.262063">passed by a vote of 51-9</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report], does not extend immunity to people who committed acts that endangered human life, but rather mainly affects approximately 400 teenagers who were charged with committing minor criminal infractions. This is the third general amnesty measure issued by Israel. The first two were issued after the Arab-Israeli conflicts of <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history3.html">1948</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html">1967</a> [NPR backgrounders]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/russia/kgb.htm">KGB</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], predecessor to the FSB, had the authority to conduct similar preemptive questioning, which was often used to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/world/europe/17russia.html?_r=1">intimidate dissidents</a> [NYT report] in the USSR. Under the legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-lower-house-approves-bill-expanding-secret-police-powers.php">approved last week by the Russian State Duma</a> [JURIST report], the FSB can, without evidence, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5816106,00.html">question and warn citizens</a> [DW report] about the possible commission of future crimes. Citizens who fail to comply with the questioning may be subject to fines or sentenced to up to 15 days in jail. Rights groups and members of the Russian legal community have <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/news/F26E6AA">condemned the law</a> [press release, in Russian] saying that it legalizes arbitrary detentions by the FSB and that it extends the scope of the FSB beyond its authority. Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/medvedev-warns-west-not-to-meddle-in-fsb-bill/410478.html">indicated that he supports the bill</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] and has warned against international interference in Russian lawmaking. The legislation, which was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i6eCHe8kgIeX8w5N5-xbvZP8OhtAD9H266780">approved in the Federation Council by a vote of 121-1</a> [AP report], will now be signed into law by Medvedev.

<p>Russia faces ongoing criticism from the international community regarding its human rights record. In October, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sova-center.ru/en/xenophobia/news-releases/2009/10/d17243/">issued a report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-report-criticizes-russia-on-human.php">report</a>] criticizing Russia's record on human rights and calling on the country to take extensive legal reform in order to guarantee its citizens rights such as fair trials and freedoms of speech and of the press. Last June, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-judicial-reform-urged-by-council.php">urged substantial reforms</a> [JURIST report] to correct systemic problems in the Russian legal system, including the prevalence of political prosecutions and a lack of judicial independence. Medvedev has <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">acknowledged the need for judicial reform</a> [JURIST report], saying that transparent courts would restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from seeking redress in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/">Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse</a> [official website] study found that the 4,145 cases referred to federal prosecutors in March and April were the most in any two-month period since the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency</a> [official website] was created under the Bush administration five years ago. The extra workload has also increased wait times for rulings, up to an average of 443 days. Among nationalities, Armenians with cases pending have the longest wait times of 938 days &#8212; more than twice the national average. Other nationalities whose citizens were within the top five in terms of the length their cases had been pending were Indonesia (731 days), Lebanon (688 days), Albania (830 days), and Iran (594 days). The heightened caseloads come as the federal government stiffens immigration enforcement and local police offices are increasing communications with immigration officials. As of January 2009, there were an estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the US, 1 million less than 2007, according to the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website]. In the same period, deportations have more than doubled, peaking at 387,790 last year.

<p>Federal authorities have indicated that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jLzuZF9DOIl3x8DX__yS2TG11X1wD9GVTBRG0">workload would continue to grow</a> [AP report] if Arizona's new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration enforcement law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] is implemented. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. The constitutionality of the law has been widely disputed, and the legislation is now facing <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">several lawsuits</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> called for <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-comprehensive-immigration-reform">comprehensive immigration reform</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">report</a>], noting the role of immigrants throughout US history and indicating that immigrants must continue to play a role as the country grows and develops. He acknowledged the continuing difficulty with securing the border but cited efforts made by the administration to improve enforcement of current laws, including increased numbers of enforcement agents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Today's ruling is a great victory for women in Oklahoma. The government has no business mandating to doctors how to practice medicine and intruding in women's private medical decisions," Stephanie Toti, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/judge-blocks-enforcement-of-ok-abortion-ultrasound-law">press release</a> [text]. Abortion rights groups call Oklahoma's ultrasound law the strictest such requirement in the nation. The text of the law states that its purpose is "in order for the woman to make an informed decision." Oklahoma County <a href="http://judgegurich.us/index-new.html">District Judge Noma Gurich</a> [official website] said the order would remain in effect at least until a hearing Jan. 21.

<p>Last month, Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Charlie Crist</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.flgov.com/leg_actions/2010/2010_hb1143.pdf">vetoed</a> [veto letter text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/session/index.cfm?BI_Mode=ViewBillInfo&Mode=Bills&ElementID=JumpToBox&SubMenu=1&Year=2010&billnum=1143">bill</a> [HB 1143 materials] that also would have required women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound or listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure would be performed. Crist said that "personal views should not result in laws that unwisely expand the role of government and coerce people to obtain medical tests or procedures that are not medically necessary. In this case, such action would violate a woman's right to privacy." In May, Oklahoma lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-approve-bill-requiring-pre-abortion-questionnaire.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring women seeking an abortion to complete a questionnaire containing information on marital status, reason for seeking the abortion and whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. In April, the Oklahoma Senate voted to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-legislature-overrides-veto-of.php">override a veto</a> [JURIST report] of two anti-abortion bills, resulting in the bills immediately becoming law. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009%2D10bills/hb/hb2780%5Fenr.rtf">first bill</a> [HB 2526 text, RTF] prevents "wrongful life" lawsuits in which parents seek damages for a child born with a birth defect because the mother was unable to obtain an abortion. The second bill is the one blocked by the court Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/switzerland-parliament-passes-us-banking-treaty.php">approved last month</a> [JURIST report] by the Swiss parliament, allows UBS to turn over information of 4,450 US clients to the US <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] and may prevent the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] from resuming a lawsuit against UBS in which it had sought the names of 52,000 UBS clients. The court also announced that they have rejected a challenge to the law by a UBS client who had objected to the data transfer. In announcing its ruling, the court noted the importance of the US-Swiss agreement, saying "the economic interests of Switzerland as well as the interests in fulfilling obligations that have been entered into in international law are of major significance and outweigh the individual interests of the complainant in this case." The ruling could potentially affect <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-19/treaty-on-ubs-accounts-is-binding-court-says-rejects-appeal.html">100 other appeals from UBS clients</a> [Bloomberg report], which are currently pending. 

<p>The US-Swiss agreement was before the Swiss parliament due to a court ruling in January, when the Federal Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/switzerland-court-rules-ubs-may-not.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an American taxpayer's financial information at UBS may not be disclosed to the IRS pursuant to an <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-reaches-deal-with-switzerland-over.php">August 2009 agreement</a> [JURIST report]. Also in January, the Federal Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/switzerland-court-rules-ubs-disclosure.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Swiss <a href="http://www.finma.ch/d/seiten/default.aspx">Financial Market Supervisory Authority</a> [official website, in German] violated the law in February 2009 when it ordered UBS to disclose information to the US on more than 250 of the bank's clients without the authority to do so. In September, the US and Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-switzerland-sign-treaty-on-sharing.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the amount of information shared between the two nations on would-be tax evaders. The agreement came one month after a Swiss banker and lawyer were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/swiss-banker-lawyer-charged-with.php">indicted in US federal court</a> [JURIST report] for helping clients hide assets. In March 2009, the Swiss announced their intention to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/switzerland-agrees-to-share-private.php">adopt a more stringent definition</a> [JURIST report] of tax evasion and to work with other countries to investigate such claims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

[JURIST] The former defense lawyer for Australian ex-<a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> detainee <a href="/currentawareness/hicks.php">David Hicks</a> [JURIST news archives] said Sunday that his former client should be cleared of all links to terrorism because he never committed a crime. The lawyer, Steve Kenny, said <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/hicks-should-clear-his-name-exlawyer-20100718-10fsx.html">he has been unable</a> [AAP report] to find a law that Hicks had broken, either under Australian, Afghan or international law, and was actually prosecuted for a crime that did not exist at the time of his trial. Hicks was <a href="http://jurist.justia.com/paperchase/2007/03/hicks-pleads-guilty-to-supporting.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of one charge of providing material support for terrorism at his US <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] after pleading guilty in 2007. In a <a href="http://www.ada.asn.au/Recent.Letters.htm">letter</a> [text] to <a href="http://www.canberratimes.com.au/"><em>The Canberra Times</a></em> [media website] on Monday, the watchdog Australia Defence Association (ADA) [advocacy website] disputed Kenny's statements, arguing:<blockquote>Hicks' 2001-06 detention was as a belligerent captured in war, not for a crime. This was and remains lawful under the Geneva Conventions - as was confirmed by the US Supreme Court in the June 2006 Hamdan ruling - and is not disputed by any serious international lawyer. ... [W]hether Hicks' later separate criminal trial, conviction and sentence by US Military Commission was justified in international law or not remains understandably controversial. But it does not change the factual and moral situations that if Hicks was to commit the same acts today as he has freely admitted doing in 2000-01 he would commit an offence against Australian law. Even ignoring Hicks' own admissions and boasts about voluntarily joining terrorist training camps, in moral terms [Hicks should] never have his name cleared of any terrorism links.</blockquote>The statements come as Hicks is <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/hicks-fights-to-have-his-conviction-overturned-20100717-10f51.html">preparing a legal challenge</a> [SMH report] to his conviction, seeking to have it overturned.

<p>Hicks was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ex-guantanamo-bay-detainee-hicks.php">released</a> from prison in December 2007 after being <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/hicks-transferred-to-australia-to.php">transferred from Guantanamo to Australia</a> [JURIST reports] in May of that year to serve the remainder of his sentence at a maximum security prison near his hometown of Adelaide, South Australia. He was later made subject to a <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/australia-court-imposes-control-order.php">control order</a> which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/australia-government-lifts-control.php">lifted</a> [JURIST reports] in December 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI documented cases of arbitrary detention, torture, enforced disappearances and death at the hands of the NISS. The suppression of dissent also includes heavy censorship of the press, with NISS agents making daily visits press and printing offices in order to intimidate and influence the content printed in publications. AI contends that under the 2010 National Security Act the NISS retains extensive powers of arrest and detention, and maintains a "culture of impunity" for human rights violations. AI maintains that the current state of the act shows that it, "remains faithful to the government's vision of the national security force as a body whose function is to maintain it in power, including by repressing the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression." The report calls for an immediate reform of the 2010 National Security Act and urges the Sudanese government to reduce the role of the NISS to information gathering and analysis. AI has also recommended that the country end impunity for those committing human rights violations and provide redress to the victims and their families. 

<p>AI's report was released one week after Sudanese <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] was charged by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">report</a>] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The charges included "genocide by killing, genocide by causing serious bodily or mental harm and genocide by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction." They were issued after the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">reversed a prior decision</a> [JURIST report] by the lower chamber denying the prosecutor's request for genocide charges.

The brief, filed in support of the US government, follows the submission of another <a href="http://www.abanet.org/media/nosearch/friendly_house_v_whiting.pdf"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] by the ABA earlier this month in a different case challenging the Arizona law filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. A revised version of that brief was also filed Wednesday, after the court requested that all supporting briefs conform to a ten-page limit. In the brief filed in support of the US, the ABA argues that the Arizona law violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text], an issue that has been of "considerable importance" to the ABA since 1983. The ABA specifically says the law should be ruled invalid because it necessarily interferes in a realm of policy that the Constitution places solely within federal jurisdiction, explaining:<blockquote>The ABA has long opposed initiatives such as S.B. 1070 that, by their plain language, can only be implemented by usurping the federal government's exclusive authority to make immigration law and set immigration policy. While the ABA believes ... that the federal immigration system must be reformed, and while the ABA appreciates Arizona's desire to tackle the problems faced by that state, the ABA also urges that our Constitution does not allow for unilateral state action in the formulation of immigration law. Immigration matters are and must remain federal, and states should not be permitted to enforce immigration law independently of specific federal authorization; the practical result of the contrary would be the undermining of uniformity in immigration law and immigration law enforcement.</blockquote>In supporting its claim that immigration is solely within federal jurisdiction, the ABA cited the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] case of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0239_0033_ZS.html">Truax v. Raich</a> [Cornell LII syllabus], and federal statute such as the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [8 USC &#167; 1101 <em>et seq</em>. text]. The brief also argued that the Arizona law would interfere with law enforcement officers' public safety functions and infringe on both citizens' and noncitizens' constitutional rights by placing upon them the burden of proving their citizenship. 

<p>Earlier this month, the ABA filed their first brief in support of a class-action lawsuit led by the ACLU, arguing that the law will increase the use of racial profiling, resulting in unlawful and unreasonable detentions and increase the burden on the state's indigent defense system. The ABA usually waits until a case reaches the appellate level to file an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief, but ABA <a href="http://www.whitecase.com/clamm/">President Carolyn Lamm</a> [professional profile] said this case requires "extraordinary action." The ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed the class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May. Two week ago, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">seeking to permanently enjoin</a> [JURIST report] the law from taking effect, arguing that the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country," and calling it counterproductive to national immigration policy. The suit was filed against the State of Arizona and <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed the legislation into law</a> [JURIST report] by in April. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">Top Secret America</a> [materials], is the product of a two-year investigation conducted by the newspaper into the intelligence community. The findings detail a complex and amorphous assortment of government agencies and private companies engaged in intelligence gathering efforts that are largely duplicative and disjointed, making effective analysis and oversight nearly impossible. This opaque intelligence structure has been perpetuated in spite of the <a href="http://www.nctc.gov/docs/pl108_458.pdf">Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004</a> [text, PDF] which <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/bush-signs-intelligence-reform-bill.php">established the DNI</a> [JURIST report] but denied the new oversight position the legal and budgetary authority to manage the <a href="http://www.intelligence.gov/">16 agencies</a> [official website] the office was intended to control and coordinate. This structure, which largely mirrors that existing before 9/11, caused the intelligence failures leading to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8346315.stm">Fort Hood shooting</a> [BBC backgrounder], where the military agency that should have been aware of warning signs before the shooting was ineffectively duplicating the efforts of other agencies, according to the report. These intelligence failures also led to the near-success of Christmas 2009 transatlantic airline bomber <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8431530.stm">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>], when critical information was possessed by several different agencies that were either unable to differentiate it from the great deal of intelligence compiled every day, or were unaware of information possessed by other agencies. 

<p>The generally negative report comes despite continued efforts to streamline and oversee intelligence gathering and coordinate government agencies. In July 2008, former president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/georgewbush/">George W. Bush</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-signs-new-executive-order-to.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] giving the DNI the authority to coordinate information sharing between different US and foreign intelligence services and to make funding decisions for the various US agencies. Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 into law in December 2004, implementing a series of intelligence reforms recommended by the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/">9/11 Commission</a> [official website] and authorizing the broadest re-working of the US intelligence structure since President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ban applies to both public and private universities, but <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jV_-6kvuvHLoKhskSm80Smyln5vAD9H2BJEG0">only affects full-face veils</a> [AP report] and not hijab headscarves that are more commonly worn in the region. Students and parents reportedly requested the ban to promote equality in education. According to a government official, the ban seeks to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/20/syria-bans-niqab-from-universities">protect the country's secular identity</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], as the niqab "contradicts university ethics" and academic traditions. Last month to promote state secularism, more than 1,200 Syrian government elementary school teachers wearing niqabs and burqas were transferred to administrative jobs where they would not come in contact with students.

<p>Many international jurisdictions are currently debating legislation that would ban full-face scarves and the burqa. <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/ministers11/damian-green/">UK Immigration Minister Damian Green</a> [official profile] indicated Sunday that Britain's coalition government would not seek or support a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-minister-government-will-not-support-burqa-ban.php">British law banning</a> [JURIST report] the wearing of the Islamic <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] or other face coverings in public. Last Tuesday the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">French National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to give police the authority to require women wearing the veils to show their face, and, if they refuse, they could be forced to attend citizenship classes or be charged a USD $185 fine. The proposed legislation would also make it a crime to force a woman to cover her face, with a penalty of one year in prison and a fine of USD $18,555. Similar legislation is also being considered in Belgium, where, in April, the Belgian House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/belgium-lower-house-approves-burqa-ban.php">voted to approve</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would ban the burqa and other full-face veils in public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month, environmental groups sought the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/recusal-motion-re-Feldman-7-2.pdf">removal of Feldman</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mtn-re-Feldman-inj-7-2-10.pdf">relief of the preliminary injunction</a> [motions, PDF] because of his personal investments in the oil industry. In the order refusing his recusal Feldman said, "The motion for disqualification is without merit." According to his <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ynews/ts_ynews/storytext/ynews_ts2771/36640284/SIG=11u6us3e5/*http://www.judicialwatch.org/jfd/Feldman_Martin_L_C/2008.pdf">2008 financial disclosure report</a> [text, PDF], Feldman owned stock in five companies directly or indirectly related to the offshore drilling business. The release of Feldman's <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/feldman.pdf">2009 financial holdings</a> [text, PDF] also showed that the judge had owned stock in Exxon Mobil, one of the companies affected by the initial moratorium. Feldman <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704293604575343361857605650.html">claimed</a> [WSJ report] he learned of his investments the day before his ruling and sold his stock the next morning.

<p>Last week, US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-issues-new-drilling-moratorium.php">new six-month drilling moratorium</a> [JURIST report], citing new evidence regarding safety concerns after the BP oil spill. Unlike the previously ordered moratorium, this one is not based on the depths at which drilling occurs, but affects drilling with specific technologies, which are most often used during deepshore drilling and will not affect shallow water drilling operations. Also last week, Government lawyers asked the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] to lift its <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM153_morat.html">order barring the previous moratorium</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-doj-request-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">report</a>] because the new plan had been filed.

The court granted bail following last month's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-876.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">report</a>] by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-876">Black v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] which vacated the conviction of the former chairman and CEO of Hollinger International Inc. under the honest services doctrine. The Supreme Court instructed the circuit court to review the jury instructions given at trial concerning the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">"honest services" doctrine</a> [18 USC &#167; 1346 text]. Black's case was remanded to the court of appeals for further consideration consistent with the Supreme Court's June <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1394">Skilling v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the "honest services" doctrine is limited in scope to bribery and kickbacks. Black is to be released on bail while the court of appeals considers whether to overturn his <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/conrad-black-found-guilty-of-mail-fraud.php">2007 conviction</a> [JURIST report]. The terms of his bail <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0720-conrad-black-20100719,0,656447.story">will be set by a district court judge</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] and it is unclear when Black will be released. Black has been in federal custody for over two years. 

<p>Black originally faced 17 counts of fraud, obstruction of justice, racketeering and tax evasion. He was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/indict/2005/us_v_black.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] by the US government of diverting more than <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/media-mogul-conrad-black-stands-trial.php">$80 million from Hollinger International and its shareholders</a> [JURIST report] during Hollinger's $2.1 billion sale of several hundred Canadian newspapers. In July 2007 Black was convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice and <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/conrad-black-sentenced-to-jail-ordered.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 78 months in prison. The court of appeals initially rejected Black's appeal, holding that <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/08-876_lower_op.pdf">&#167; 1346 may be applied in a private setting</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-rejects-conrad-black.php">report</a>] regardless of whether the defendant's conduct risked any foreseeable economic harm to the victim. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-to-hear-conrad-black.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] last year to determine the scope of the "honest services" clause. Black is also currently facing <a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/UstcDockInq/asp/Index.asp#">charges</a> [docket] before the <a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/">US Tax Court</a> [official website] for <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-19/conrad-black-granted-bail-while-appealing-conviction.html">failure to pay nearly $71 million in taxes</a> [Bloomberg report].

The conviction comes after Boskic confessed to his role in the massacre, where 1,200 unarmed prisoners of war were killed, accepting a plea agreement with the BiH <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/?id=9&jezik=e&kat=5&opcija=sadrzaj">Prosecutor's Office</a> [official website]. Under the plea deal, Boskic was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the court, the lowest sentence he could have received for the charges, in return for his cooperation with prosecutors. In explaining the decision to seek only the 10-year sentence, the prosecutor <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/?id=724&jezik=e">emphasized the usefulness of the information</a> [press release] Boskic provided, and his remorse, stating that the prosecutor <blockquote>bore in mind that the accused[,] ... while in detention in the USA, admitted his guilt and expressed his remorse. The accused stated that he was aware of the crimes he committed and the suffering he caused, and that he must be punished for his actions. Moreover, the accused ... did not seek extradition to Croatia; he holds Croatian citizenship and would thus become unavailable to [Bosnia and Herzegovina's (BiH)] judicial authorities. Instead, he expressed his wish to be deported to BiH, to admit his guilt for the crimes charged and to be punished for the crimes that he had committed.</blockquote>Boskic was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-serbian-war-crimes.php">extradited to BiH from the US</a> in April after a 2006 US court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/bosnian-immigrant-sentenced-to-5-years.php">sentencing him to 63 months</a> [JURIST reports] in prison for failing to reveal his role in the massacre while seeking refugee status in the US, where he briefly worked in the construction industry. 

<p>Boskic was <a href="/paperchase/2004/08/bosnian-refugee-accused-of-serving-as.htm">charged</a> [JURIST report] in August 2004 with five counts of making false declarations on US immigration applications and in an interview with federal agents. He <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/bosnian-pleads-not-guilty-to-us.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report], claiming he had been held in a Serbian prison camp and threatened with a gun to his head if he did not take part in the killings. He was convicted in July on two counts of concealing his military record. Boskic was first <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/08/27/war_crimes_suspect_charged_in_boston/">arrested</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] in the US in 2004, when immigration officials charged him with fraud and misuse of a visa for not reporting his foreign military service. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement comes two days after the Tribunal ruled that farmers who lost their land under Zimbabwe's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/land/gp_zimbabwe.html">land reform program</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+land">news archive</a>] may <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/africa-court-refers-zimbabwe-land-reform-case-to-regional-summit-meeting.php">take their case to the SADC summit meeting</a> [JURIST report] next month. Chinamasa also said that the Tribunal's rulings would <a href="http://www.swradioafrica.com/News190710/GovSnub190710.htm">not influence the Zimbabwe government's policies</a> [SWRA report] on land reform, and called the farmers' cases propaganda efforts. On Monday, the Zimbabwean government <a href="http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32742:zim-to-challenge-property-attachments&catid=52&Itemid=32">filed an application</a> [<em>The Zimbabwean</em> report] in the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/south_africa.htm">North Gauteng High Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] in South Africa, seeking to prevent the petitioners in the land reform case from attaching property owned by the Zimbabwean government in that country. The farmers attached the land and sought to force its sale in order to enforce the Tribunal order of monetary compensation and payment of legal fees for the land that was confiscated by the Zimbabwean government. The property's value is estimated at over USD $1 million. In January, the Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/zimbabwe.htm">High Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/zimbabwe-high-court-refuses-to-register.php">ruled that it is not bound</a> [JURIST report] by the Tribunal's decision ordering the state to halt its land reforms, refusing to register it. Justice Bharat Patel stated that enforcing the ruling, which was in favor of white farmers whose land was <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">taken over in the government's farm redistribution program</a> [JURIST report], would violate the Zimbabwean <a href="http://www.parlzim.gov.zw/cms/UsefulResourses/ZimbabweConstitution.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and would be against public policy.

<p>Last week's ruling, which also reaffirmed a previous ruling finding the land reform program <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">racially motivated</a> [JURIST report], discriminatory and contrary to the SADC <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/press%20releases/SADCTreaty.doc">treaty</a> [text, DOC], marks the third time that the Tribunal has referred Zimbabwe to the SADC summit meeting for non-compliance with court orders, continued human rights abuses and violation of the SADC treaty. The summit has yet to act in any of these instances. In bringing the case to the Tribunal, the dispossessed farmers urged the SADC to suspend Zimbabwe from membership until it either halted the seizures or compensated the farmers, as previously ordered by the Tribunal. The farmers have alleged that they face ongoing violence and harassment by government forces seeking to evict them from their farmland. Zimbabwean <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/africa/july-dec08/mugabe_12-12.html">President Robert Mugabe</a> [PBS profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=robert+mugabe">news archive</a>] has defended the law, calling it necessary to correct historical racial disparities resulting from the country's history as a British colony.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ministry of Industry and Information Technology spokesperson Zhang Feng, speaking at a press conference, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gniguiiF4A0_NcKqq-3HSQTxL5Uw">said that the agreement allowed</a> [UKPA report] the Chinese government to renew Google's Internet Content Provider (ICP) license. The agreement with Google, according to Zhang, will prevent users from accessing information that will compromise national security, damage national interests or spread hatred. According to a spokesperson for the internet company, the agreement <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZWuCbdgxTUThD2PGQR42Ny7J09A">will not require Google to censor</a> [AFP report] its China or Hong Kong based websites, and will allow the company to keep several of its services available to Chinese users. The Chinese government confirmed earlier this month that <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/11/c_13394498.htm">it had renewed Google's ICP license</a> [Xinhua report], allowing the company to continue operating within the country. In June, Google <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-to-stop-redirecting-china-users-to-unfiltered-hong-kong-search-engine.php">announced that it would stop redirecting</a> [JURIST report] Internet users in mainland China to its unfiltered search engine in Honk Kong in an effort to renew the company's ICP license. In March, Google <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/google-stops-censoring-china-search.php">began redirecting users</a> [JURIST report] from its <a href="http://www.google.cn/">google.cn</a> search engine to <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/">google.com.hk</a> [websites] after reaching a legal impasse with the Chinese government over censoring search results. The redirect allowed Google to maintain a presence in mainland China without having to filter search results. The Chinese government claimed that Google did not uphold agreements the company had made when it entered the Chinese market in 2006 and that the company "violated its written promise" when it ceased censoring Internet searches. 

<p>In February, China issued new regulations <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">tightening restrictions on Internet use</a> [JURIST report] by requiring citizens operating websites to submit identity cards and meet with regulators before their sites can be registered. The new policies came amid negotiations with Google regarding the Internet company's January <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">threat to discontinue operations in China</a> [JURIST report] due to the country's overarching Internet censorship. Google's action was in response to a cyber attack on its Gmail service in December, which targeted the e-mail accounts of human rights activists in China and drew the ire of rights groups around the world. Google indicated that it would work with the Chinese government to find a way to allow an, "unfiltered search engine within the law as well," but also noted that if an agreement cannot be reached, it would close its offices there and shut down its google.cn website. China <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">responded by reiterating its commitment</a> [JURIST report] to open Internet, but stressed that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abd-al-Nisr Mohammed Khantumani was released to Cape Verde, while Abdul Aziz Naji was repatriated to his native Algeria. Naji had appealed to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>], asking that it review his pending transfer and that he be allowed to remain at the Guantanamo facility. In his appeal, Naji expressed concern that he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/19/AR2010071904922.html">would be tortured or killed</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] if returned to Algeria. The court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Naji-denial-7-16-10.pdf">rejected his request</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/supreme-court-permits-guantanamo-detainees-return-to-algeria.php">report</a>] Friday, clearing the remaining legal hurdles to his repatriation. The Obama administration had indicated it had received assurances from the Algerian government that Naji would not be mistreated after returning to the country, citing the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algerians</a> [JURIST report] who have been returned to the country from Guantanamo Bay, without incident as proof that Naji would be safe in the country. DOD said that the orders to release both men were carefully scrutinized and that a number of factors, including security issues, were considered when deciding to release the detainees. DOD also noted the appreciation of the US government for the cooperation they have received from Algeria and Cape Verde in supporting the efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay facility. There are currently 178 detainees awaiting transfer from Guantanamo. 

<p>The Obama administration continues its push to close the Guantanamo Bay facility, despite missing its self-imposed <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">one-year deadline</a> [JURIST report] in January. The administration has run into several hurdles in closing the prison, including opposition from members of Congress and the suspension of detainee <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the US <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/house-committee-votes-not-to-fund-US-facility-for-Guantanamo-transfers.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting the Obama administration from modifying or building a facility in the US to hold detainees currently held at Guantanamo. The bill requires that any plan to construct or modify US facilities to accommodate Guantanamo transfers be "accompanied by a thorough and comprehensive plan that outlines the merits, costs and risks associated with utilizing such a facility." As the Obama administration has not presented such a plan to Congress, the bill prohibits the use of any funds for the purpose of preparing a US facility for Guantanamo transfers. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Van Anraat appealed to the ECHR, arguing that because the Netherlands did not have jurisdiction over members of the Iraqi government who perpetrated the war crimes, including Saddam Hussein, he could not be convicted for his complicity in the war crimes. He also argued that the definition of "customs of war" provided by the Dutch War Crimes Act did not meet the international standard of sufficiency required under the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials]. The court dismissed Van Anraat's argument regarding jurisdiction, stating that the issue was not raised until the appeals process and that the court hearing the appeal was not required to consider the argument at that time. It also rejected the contention that the definition of war crimes was vague, stating that there was nothing unclear about the criminal nature of using mustard gas as a weapon, at the time when Van Anraat sold the chemical to the Iraqis. Van Anraat is currently serving a 16-year sentence. 

<p>In June 2009, the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/default.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Dutch] <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BG4822&u_ljn=BG4822">upheld</a> [judgment, in Dutch; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/netherlands-high-court-upholds.php">report</a>] Van Anraat's conviction finding that the record, including his continuing role as Iraq's sole supplier of TDG after the death of 5,000 Iraqis in the <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/saddam-judge-investigating-halabja.php">1988 Hajabla attack</a> [JURIST report], showed that his participation was intentional. Prior to the Supreme Court hearing the case, Van Anraat had appealed his conviction on charges of complicity in war crimes to the Court of Appeal, which also <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BA4676&u_ljn=BA4676">upheld the conviction</a> [judgment, in Dutch] in May 2007.

The vote divided largely along party lines, with Democrats voting unanimously in favor of sending the nomination forward, joined by one Republican vote. <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/">Senator John Cornyn</a> (R-TX) [official website] <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=15c009b9-0200-426c-9516-81c93668d2bb&ContentType_id=b94acc28-404a-4fc6-b143-a9e15bf92da4&Group_id=24eb5606-e2db-4d7f-bf6c-efc5df80b676">explained his 'no' vote</a> [press release] by arguing that Kagan did not meet a "proper judicial philosophy" and that her testimony suggested that her values were "out of step with those of the American people." Before casting his vote in support Kagan's nomination, <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/">Senator Lindsey Graham</a> (R-SC) [official website] criticized the confirmation process, arguing that senators allow their personal philosophies to influence their vote and said: <blockquote>I think there's a good reason for a conservative to vote yes, and that's provided in the Constitution itself. ... All of us abhor judicial activism, ... [but] are we living in an age of legislative activism[?] ... I could give you a hundred reasons to vote 'no,' ...  but the Constitution in my view puts a requirement on me as a senator to not replace my judgment for [the president's], ... it puts upon me a standard ...  that's stood the test of time: is the person qualified, is it a person of good character, is it someone who understands the difference between being a judge and being a politician, and quite frankly, I think [Kagan has] passed all those tests.</blockquote>In a statement following the vote, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama&sa=X&ei=d-hFTN_RKMSDnQed4rTfAw&ved=0CDUQ0gIoAjAD&usg=AFQjCNG2LdN58StTsLE0mLsvgce1r2psHg">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-president-senate-judiciary-committee-vote">described the vote as a "bipartisan affirmation"</a> [press release] of Kagan's strong performance during the confirmation hearings. The full Senate is expected to vote on the nomination next month. 

<p>Last week, the committee <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kagan-committee-vote-delayed-a-week-by-Republican-Senator.php">delayed the vote on the confirmation</a> [JURIST report] at the request of <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/">Senator Jeff Sessions</a> (R-AL) [official website]. In requesting the delay, Sessions described the confirmation process as <a href="http://www.senate.gov/fplayers/CommPlayer/commFlashPlayer.cfm?fn=judiciary071310&st=xxx">moving in an "expeditious manner,"</a> [hearing video] and went on to outline his potential objections to Kagan's confirmation. Among them, he called Kagan's answers to questions during her confirmation hearings as "less than candid" and expressed concern over her positions on legislation during her time working in the Clinton administration.

According to Pillay, security forces in the southern part of the country have been arbitrarily detaining large numbers of Uzbeks in violation of both Kyrgz and international laws. Pillay cited cases of torture and intimidation leading to an "increasing climate of fear" within the country, including reports of repeated beatings, detainees being forced to confess to crimes they did not commit and detainees being forced to pay bribes in order to be released. She also noted reports of security forces attempting to influence victims seeking medical attention, causing doctors to refuse treatment to victims of torture. Pillay emphasized the importance of holding those responsible for the violations accountable stating that, "accountability for past crimes and redoubled efforts at fighting impunity, while respecting the rights of all in Kyrgyzstan, are necessary to ensure protection, respect for the rule of law and to avoid a repeat of ethnic violence." She also noted the need for an independent investigation into the ethnic violence. 

<p>Last week, Kyrgyz interim <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">President Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-establishes-commission-to-probe-ethnic-violence.php">established a commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the recent ethnic violence against the country's Uzbek population. The commission is comprised of <a href="http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/07/15/12423293.html">30 former government officials</a> [VOR report], human rights activists and professors, headed by former parliament speaker Abdygany Erkebayev. It will consult with government and international experts and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jmGg17iNEZMRWFNXOi3o9_iRNXeQ">present its findings</a> [AP report] on the causes and repercussions of the violence in September. Earlier this month, the Kyrgyz government announced that it has <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-opens-criminal-cases-following-ethnic-rioting.php">opened more than 1,000 criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] stemming from the recent violence. Regional officials in Osh, an area in southern Kyrgyzstan, announced that <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15305354&PageNum=0">106 individuals had already been detained</a> [ITAR-TASS report]. The violence resulted from a clash between the Kyrgyz majority and the Uzbek minority and official estimates place the death toll at 309, with an additional 2,000 reportedly injured. Property damage estimates exceed $71 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With consultative status, the IGLHRC will be able to collaborate with UN agencies and member governments and attend UN meetings. The vote comes on the heels of a significant lobbying effort by the Obama administration in favor of accreditation. Additionally, the accreditation was supported by <a href="http://ihrc.digitopia.net/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/428-1.pdf">14 members of Congress</a> and <a href="http://ihrc.digitopia.net/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/429-1.pdf">four Senators</a> [letter texts, PDF], who sent letters of support on the group's behalf.

Today's vote reaffirmed the Economic and Social Council's commitment to include a diverse range of voices from civil society in the work of the UN. Most important, the vote was a significant achievement for all those who work to see the United Nations embody its founding principles and advance the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</blockquote>Among the "no" votes were China, Egypt, Russia and Pakistan, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gJYNH2s-C9t79VHX2SYvl7VNQkzQD9H2FJBO0">citing procedural reasons</a> [AP report] for doing so.

The indictment was accepted by the Istanbul <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/turkey.htm">12th High Criminal Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] and alleges that the plot was crafted in an Istanbul army base shortly after the <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] took power in November 2002. Prosecutors are calling for <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE66I4J020100719">prison sentences of 15 to 20 years</a> [Reuters report] for the defendants. The military has maintained that the plot is a war game exercise. The trial date has <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/balyoz-iddianamesi-kabul-edildi-2.html">not been set</a> [ANA report]. In February, a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">charged an additional 11 military officers</a> [JURIST report] in the plot and arrested 18 more. Additionally in February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">40 military officers</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/twelve-turkish-military-officers.php">12 high-ranking Turkish military officers</a> [JURIST reports] were arrested and charged for their involvement in the plot. 

<p>In June, the trial of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">33 retired and active naval officers began</a> [JURIST report]. The officers were accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule in another plot planned by a group called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>]. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the AKP.

The investigations have strained relations between the religiously-inclined government and the secular military, which has been responsible for four coups in the last fifty years. Since the founding of the modern republic in 1923, the military has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/29/turkey.islam">regarded itself as the defender</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of the secular legacy of founder <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [Turkish News profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In reversing the acquittal, the appeals chamber ordered a retrial, holding that the trial chamber had erred when it failed to grant the prosecution additional time to secure the testimony of two witnesses. Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj, who were all commanders in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], will now be tried again for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war. In explaining the severity of the trial chamber's error, the appeals court stated: <blockquote>[I]t is clear that the Trial Chamber seriously erred in failing to take adequate measures to secure the testimony of certain witnesses. ... [T]he Trial Chamber failed to appreciate the gravity of the threat that witness intimidation posed to the trial's integrity. Some of these failures were in response to specific requests by the Prosecution, while in certain other cases the Trial Chamber should have acted proprio motu to facilitate witness testimony. For the reasons set out in the Judgement, the Appeals Chamber therefore has found that the Trial Chamber failed to take sufficient steps to counter the witness intimidation that permeated the trial. Given the potential importance of these witnesses to the Prosecution's case, the error undermined the fairness of the proceedings and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</blockquote>The appeals chamber went on to reject the other grounds upon which the prosecution had appealed, finding that the trial chamber had not erred in acquitting Balaj of aiding and abetting three murders and for rape, cruel treatment and torture. The date for the retrial has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hSEy-tVqyKvdlwYUW1IC5ld6Wu7gD9H3DP0G0">not been set</a> [AP report].

<p>Last July, the appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-reverses-upholds-convictions-for.php">affirmed the conviction of Bajrush Morina</a> [JURIST report] for interfering with a witness during the trial. In May 2008, ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icty-prosecutor-appeals-war-crimes.php">filed an appeal against the acquittals</a> [JURIST report]. Brammertz asked that the case be retried before a different chamber of the tribunal, arguing that prosecution was not allowed the to present enough witnesses. Haradinaj was charged with <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/icty-trial-begins-for-former-kosovo.php">37 counts of war crimes</a> [JURIST report], including murder, persecution and rape, but the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted him of all charges</a> [JURIST report] in April 2008, citing a lack of evidence. Haradinaj was a senior commander of the KLA, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force that opposed <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Since the acquittal, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and other top officials have expressed concern that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-officials-denounce-acquittal-of.php">decision could heighten tensions</a> [JURIST report] in Kosovo and decrease the likelihood that fugitive war crimes suspects <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Radovan+Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> and <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archives] would be caught.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AIDS-Free World released a <a href="http://www.aids-freeworld.org/images/stories/Zimbabwe/zim%20grid%20screenversionfinal.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aids-freeworld.org/content/view/341/202/">press release</a>] last December, detailing the systematic rape of female supporters of <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website] candidate <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile] by supporters of the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>]. According to the report, 70 victims were interviewed, and the group was able to document 380 rapes committed by 241 perpetrators in the weeks leading up to the presidential elections. The documented rapes followed similar patterns, with comparable rhetoric about the MDC being used before and after the rapes and the victims being subjected to similar tortures including arbitrary detentions and repeated beatings. The crimes were allegedly committed by members of the ZANU-PF youth militia, war veterans and security forces under the control of Mugabe. The group also contends that many of the women were threatened with HIV and that 37-percent of the victims interviewed have now tested positive for the virus. AIDS-Free World is urging the ICC to launch proceedings against the perpetrators of the rapes for crimes against humanity, as well as those in a position of power, such as Mugabe, who had the authority to order the rapes. The group expressed concern about the continued impunity for the crimes, stating that if the international community does not take action, similar intimidation tactics could be used in future elections. A new election could be called in Zimbabwe as soon as 2011. 

<p>Zimbabwe's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zimbabwe+elections">2008 elections</a> [JURIST news archive] were marred by <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/zimbabwe-police-probing-at-least-100.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] and government ballot rigging. Zimbabwe police <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-opposition-party.php">arrested several members of the MDC</a> prior to the election, allegedly to prevent the MDC party from participating in the election and the UN <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/un-rights-chief-criticizes-zimbabwe.php">criticized both parties for rights abuses</a> [JURIST reports] leading up to the election. A period of uncertainty also followed the elections, after the ruling government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/zimbabwe-high-court-rejects-opposition.php">initially refused to release election results</a>, and then announced that a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/zimbabwe-election-commission-says-run.php">run-off election was needed</a> [JURIST reports] because Tsvangirai had won a slim majority of the votes, but not enough to claim outright victory. Mugabe ran unopposed in the run-off election after Tsvangirai withdrew his candidacy and sought refuge at the Dutch embassy. The results of the run-off election were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">condemned by the international community</a> [JURIST report] as being neither transparent nor impartial, and the government of Mugabe has been called illegitimate.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition was stayed under a criteria set forth by the US Supreme Court's 1975 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17981625702181340483">Schlesinger v. Councilman</a> [opinion text], staying action on the petition until the resolution of the military commission proceedings because the claims in Khadr's <em>habeas</em> petition can be raised during the commission or in the appeals process. Judge John Bates still allowed Khadr to amend his petition, finding that it was not "futile" as the government alleged, because the stay may be lifted after Khadr concludes his appeals from the commission. Khadr argued that the intent for district courts to hear his <em>habeas</em> petition despite the ongoing commission was demonstrated by the differences in the military commission acts of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/PL-109-366.pdf">2006</a> and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">2009</a> [texts, PDF], in which &#167; 950j(b) of the 2006 act, providing for district court review only after the conclusion of the military commission, was removed. Bates rejected this. Additionally, the court maintained the stay on the petition despite Khadr's argument that the amended petition fell under one of the exceptions to <u>Councilman</u>, arguing that the military lacked <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/personal_jurisdiction">personal jurisdiction</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] over him because he was a juvenile at the time of his capture and that the military commission system established by Congress was unconstitutional. Bates rejected both arguments, finding that the jurisdictional argument did not fall with the <u>Councilman</u> exceptions, and cited the Supreme Court case of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-184.ZS.html">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a> [Cornell LII syllabus] in upholding the constitutionality of the military commissions.

<p>A US military lawyer for Khadr announced Saturday that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-lawyer-to-offer-vigorous-defense.php">vigorously defend Khadr</a> at his US military commission trial <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-judge-sets-opening-date-for-khadr-trial.php">scheduled to begin August 10</a> [JURIST reports]. Khadr fired his US civilian lawyers earlier this month and requested that his US military lawyer be fired as well. Judge Patrick Parrish denied Khadr's request and ordered US Army Lt-Col. Jon Jackson to remain Khadr's lawyer and provide him with a defense at trial. At a pre-trial hearing held last week, Khadr informed the court that he had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-tells-court-he-previously-rejected-plea-deal.php">rejected a plea deal</a> [JURIST report] offered by the US government, which would have resulted in a five-year prison sentence. Khadr told the court that the agreement was a ploy by the US government to look good in the eyes of the international community and that he would not be used to achieve US goals. Khadr also informed the court that he did not wish to mount a defense at trial because he believed the outcome would be the same regardless of his defense and that he had no hope of obtaining justice through the legal process. Khadr is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">facing murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed one US soldier and injuring another. If he is found guilty, he could face a life sentence. Khadr's defense lawyers have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/canada-court-orders-pm-to-request.php">repeatedly sought his repatriation</a> [JURIST report] to Canada on the basis that the Canadian government's refusal to request repatriation from the US violates the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs contend that BP assumed responsibility for the health and safety of the local cleanup workers hired by the company but failed to provide them with adequate training, protective equipment, decontamination equipment and instructions to help them conduct the cleanup in a safe manner. Plaintiff John Wunstell, a former shrimper, alleges that he was hospitalized after being exposed to the chemical dispersants used to clean the oil, and that he is now at a greater risk of developing lung and esophageal cancer due to his exposure to the chemicals. Plaintiffs also contend that they were required to use their own boats to conduct cleanup efforts and that the boats are now damaged, threatening their future ability to earn a living through commercial fishing. Plaintiffs are seeking damages for current and future medical care, repair and detoxification of the fishing boats as well as damages for loss of earnings capacity. The complaint also includes a class action claim that would cover all workers or volunteers participating in the cleanup efforts who have shown symptoms including nausea, severe headaches, respiratory illness, increased liver enzymes and high blood pressure. The class action is seeking the establishment of a court-supervised medical monitoring program in order to provide early detection of diseases associated with the chemical exposure.

<p>Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP, as evidence of the oil giant's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come out. Last month, two lawsuits were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">filed against BP</a> [JURIST report] alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Rackteer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.] statute. The lawsuits allege that BP purposefully defrauded the American public in order increase company profits. Also last month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] is reviewing whether any <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">criminal or civil laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP resulting in the oil spill. Holder cited several statutes being examined by government lawyers including the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/lcwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> [materials]. The Clean Water Act includes both civil and criminal penalties, and the Oil Pollution Act can be used to hold parties liable for cleanup costs. In May, DC-based consumer advocacy organization <a href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/">Food and Water Watch</a> (FWW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-drilling-at-bp-gulf-%20platform.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a US district court against the US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of Interior</a> (DOI) and the <a href="http://www.mms.gov/">Minerals Management Service</a> (MMS) [official websites] for an injunction to halt drilling at the BP <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">Atlantis Facility</a> [corporate website], another BP Gulf of Mexico site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling comes after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10707406">allegations of fraud</a> [BBC report] in the election, which has been described as Guinea's first free election since attaining independence in 1958. Chief Justice Mamadou Sima Sylla announced that out of the 24 candidates appearing on the ballot, former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo received nearly 44 percent of the vote, opposition leader Alpha Conde received 18 percent and Sidya Toure garnered 13 percent. With no candidates claiming a majority, a runoff will be held between Diallo and Conde. The runoff was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/guineaNews/idAFLDE66K1LY20100721?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">initially scheduled for July 18</a> [Reuters report], but was postponed while the court considered 15 complaints of misconduct during the balloting. The votes have divided primarily along ethnic lines, with all candidates running on a similar platform of economic expansion and the rule of law. A date for the runoff has not yet been set, but according to the Constitution, the vote must be held at least 14 days after the court's ruling. 

<p>The election comes as the conclusion to 18 months of governance by a military junta, which took power in a 2008 coup. The coup followed the death of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7796741.stm">Lansana Conte</a> [BBC profile], who had ruled the West African country since 1984. The election was postponed several times and was originally scheduled for December 2009 by the military government. In May, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) sent a delegation from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) [official websites] to Guinea to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-prosecutors-investigating-2009-military-violence-in-guinea.php">further investigate the killing</a> [JURIST report] of more than <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280603.stm">150 pro-democracy protesters in Conakry</a> [BBC backgrounder] in September 2009. The protesters had rallied against Guinean military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who announced in October that he intended to push elections forward three months and stand for election, breaking a promise not to run made shortly after he took power. An assassination attempt on Camara two months later eventually drove him into exile. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontobamasigning.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-signing-dodd-frank-wall-street-reform-and-consumer-protection-act">signed</a> [statement] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04173:">Restoring Financial Stability Act</a> [HR 4173 materials] into law. The legislation, which focuses on increasing regulation in the financial sector following the recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=economic+crisis">economic crisis</a> [JURIST news archive], received <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-senate-sends-financial-reform-legislation-to-obama.php">final approval by the Senate</a> last week after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-house-approves-financial-reform-legislation.php">approved by the House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this month. The law will create a new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent the companies from becoming "too big to fail." It also gives the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] the power to supervise the largest financial companies and report to the government any risks the firms may pose to the economy at large. Additionally, a new consumer protection division will be established within the Federal Reserve to enforce rules against certain business practices like abusive mortgage lending and some credit card practices. As a final protection against future bailouts, the government will have the ability to seize and liquidate failing financial institutions before their collapse can have an adverse affect on the entire economy. The so-called "Volcker Rule" is included in the legislation, but instead of prohibiting banks from owning hedge funds, banks will be permitted to invest up to 3 percent of their capital into hedge funds or private equity funds. The legislation also includes regulation of some derivatives, requiring that they be bought and sold through clearinghouses or exchanges. One little-noted provision included in the legislation is a regulation requiring US companies producing electronic equipment like cell phones and laptops, to divulge what steps are being taken to ensure their products do not contain "conflict minerals" from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+republic+of+Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [JURIST news archive]. The sale of "conflict minerals" have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/20/AR2010072006212.html">played a large role in ongoing violence</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] in the DRC. When signing the bill, Obama called the reforms "the strongest consumer financial protections in history" and stated that because of financial reform, "the American people will never again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes."

<p>The House and Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-senate-reconcile-financial-reform-bills.php">reconciled their versions of the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month but were forced to re-open negotiations, eventually removing a $17.9 billion tax on large financial institutions that was meant to cover the bill's costs. The Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-senate-approves-financial-reform-legislation.php">approved its version</a> of the bill in May, after the House <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">passed its version</a> [JURIST reports] in December. The Senate <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Banking Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf">proposed a bill</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">report</a>] in 2009 that was met with resistance and resulted in the committee's development of the bill ultimately passed by the Senate. One provision in the bill that has been the source of much debate is the creation of a consumer protection agency. The House <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> to create the agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July 2009. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving the Obama administration's stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. Last June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Bashir was charged last week by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">report</a>] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The genocide charges were added to seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">filed against al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009. Al-Bashir is in Chad to take part in a meeting of the <a href="http://www.cen-sad.org/">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</a> (CEN-SAD) [official website], and the visit is his first to an ICC member state since the warrants were issued. The government of Chad indicated that al-Bashir would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iirOh1mSFcbkLEeuwinDtcE5mqNw">not be arrested</a> [AFP report] during his visit to the country because he is there as an acting member of CEN-SAD. HRW contends that because Chad is a party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], it has an obligation under the statute to execute outstanding arrest warrants issued by the ICC. A spokesperson for HRW warned about the implication of al-Bashir being allowed in the country without being arrested stating that, "Chad risks the shameful distinction of being the first ICC member state to harbor a suspected war criminal from the court." The spokesperson also noted that, "a political deal between Chad and Sudan is no justification for shielding alleged war criminals." 

<p>The recent charges against al-Bashir come after the appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">reversed a prior decision</a> [JURIST report] by the lower chamber denying the prosecutor's request for genocide charges. ICC prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-prosecutors-appeal-decision-not-to.php">appealed the decision</a> [JURIST report] not to charge al-Bashir with genocide in July 2009. The appeals chamber found that the standard of proof applied by the lower chamber had been too high, and that there only needed to be a showing of reasonable grounds of a genocidal specific intent, a showing that had been met when the first arrest warrant was issued. The warrant issued last week alleges that the Sudanese government, using the national armed forces, police and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3613953.stm">Janjaweed militia</a> [BBC backgrounder], targeted ethnic groups for extermination that were believed to be close to armed opposition groups in Darfur as part of a counter-insurgency strategy, and that as commander-in-chief of Sudanese forces, Bashir "played an essential role in [its] coordinati[on]." Al-Bashir has eluded arrest since the issuance of the first warrant. The warrant has been controversial, with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-joins-calls-for-icc-to-delay.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> and others calling for the proceedings against Bashir to be delayed, and African Union leaders <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/au-leaders-agree-not-to-cooperate-with.php">agreeing</a> [JURIST reports] not to cooperate with the warrant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ordinance, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php">passed by city voters in a referendum</a> [JURIST report] last month, requires all employers in the city to register for the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify program</a> [DHS website] and makes it a crime to rent to illegal immigrants. The ordinance also voids any lease entered into by an illegal immigrant and requires every person seeking to rent residential property to obtain an occupancy permit from the city, which will require the applicant to sign a declaration affirming his or her US citizenship or otherwise provide a visa or employment authorization number. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] filed their lawsuits in the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website]. In its <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-7-21-MartinezvFremont-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], the ACLU challenges the law based on the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clauses of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text]. The ACLU alleges that the ordinance was passed with the intent of discriminating against people based on their race or national origin, violating Equal Protection. It argues that the law violates the Supremacy Clause because immigration is a matter solely within federal jurisdiction and Congress has enacted a comprehensive immigration scheme. MALDEF's <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fremonttribune.com/content/tncms/assets/editorial/8/5e/275/85e275f4-94e4-11df-8ca0-001cc4c03286-revisions/4c471f68d1d5c.pdf.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] makes nearly identical arguments, adding that the ordinance interferes with a person's right to enter into and enforce contracts under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001981----000-.html">federal law</a> [42 USC &#167; 1981 text] and violates Article 11 of the <a href="http://www.neded.org/files/research/stathand/parttwo/nebconst.html">Nebraska Constitution</a> [text] because the Fremont municipal government has not been empowered by the <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/">Nebraska Legislature</a> [official website] to enforce immigration law. Additionally, MALDEF cites five cases of similar local laws that were struck down by federal and state courts, including a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-texas-city.php">nearly identical law struck down</a> [JURIST report] by a federal district court in Texas. The law will become effective July 29.

<p>The ordinance was passed in June, with 57 percent in favor, in response to a wave of immigration to the region due to the availability of jobs in the meatpacking industry. The <a href="http://supremecourt.ne.gov/supreme-court/">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/opinions/2010/april/apr23/s09-448.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the vote could occur, denying the city's request for declaratory relief on the basis that the ordinance would be preempted by federal law. A similar initiative was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10364664.stm">narrowly voted down</a> [BBC report] by the <a href="http://www.fremontne.gov/index.aspx?NID=29">Fremont City Council</a> [official website] in 2008. Shortly after the ordinance's passage, the <a href="http://www.aclunebraska.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska</a> [advocacy website] promised to <a href="http://www.aclunebraska.org/index.php/racial-discrimination/85-aclu-promises-suit-against-fremont-anti-immigrant-law">challenge the ordinance in court</a> [press release], describing the law as "un-American and unconstitutional" and arguing that the ordinance will "cause discrimination and racial profiling against Latinos and others who appear to be foreign born, including U.S. citizens." The ACLU is also <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] Arizona's new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] on similar grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, first passed by the Knesset in 2002, allows only Palestinian women 25 years or older and men 35 years or older to join their families in Israel and eventually be eligible for full citizenship. The law, now <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3923082,00.html">extended for six months</a> [Ynet report], has been extended every year since it was first passed. In explaining the need for the law, <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Personalities/From+A-Z/Yakov_Margi.htm">Minister of Religious Services Yakov Margi</a> [official profile] stated that the policy was necessary to increase security because some Palestinian residents have exploited their legal status following reunification proceedings to carry out suicide bombings. Arab-Israeli members of the Knesset <a href="http://www.globe-democrat.com/news/2010/jul/21/israel-extends-citizenship-law/">described the law as racist and discriminatory</a> [UPI report] and said that it failed to address security concerns. 

<p>In May 2006, the <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/israel-supreme-court-upholds-law.php">ruled 6-5 to uphold the law</a> [JURIST report], holding that it does not infringe upon the constitutional rights of Israelis, and, if it does, that harm is "measured." The dissent wrote that the law violates the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm">Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty</a> [text] by infringing on the right to family life. The petitioners challenging the law said it impermissibly interferes with their right to have a Palestinian family in Israel. Critics say the law is motivated by a desire to maintain Israel's Jewish majority. Israel's State Prosecutor said that the state has granted 6,000 of the 22,000 family reunification applications received since a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/7736/middle_east.html">1993 Oslo Accords</a> [CFR backgrounder] between Israel and the Palestinians. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/amnesty-calls-for-repeal-of.htm">called on Israel to repeal the law</a> [JURIST report] in 2004, calling it "explicitly discriminatory," in violation of international humanitarian law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20100721-28645.html">overturned a lower court ruling</a> [The <em>Local</em> report], which prohibited the monitoring of a member of the Left. In its ruling the, court stated that the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5823929,00.html">party has unconstitutional goals</a> [DW report], which makes the government surveillance legitimate. The Left party has some historic ties to the former East German Communist party and has been linked to violent left-wing extremist groups. The suit challenging the surveillance was filed by Left member Bobo Ramelow, who has indicated that he will appeal the court's decision to the <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German]. 

<p>The German government continues monitoring the rise of extremist groups and attempting to limit their influence within the country. Last November, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-constitutional-court-upholds.php">Constitutional Court upheld legislation</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting public support and justification of the Nazi regime. The ruling means that neo-Nazis are forbidden from assembling for the purposes of of approving, glorifying or justifying the Nazi regime. The OPC <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/german-government-reports-neo-nazi.php">issued a report in 2006</a> [JURIST report] showing an increase in neo-Nazi violence. In 2005, the Constitutional Court ruled that despite the failure of past government efforts, the extreme right-wing neo-Nazi party <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/german-high-court-judge-revives.php">could still be banned</a> [JURIST report] under German law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontbotswana.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.saflii.org/bw/cases/BWHC/">Botswana High Court</a> [SAFLII database] ruled Wednesday that the indigenous <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0102/feature6/index.html">Bushmen</a> [<em>National Geographic</em> backgrounder], or San, people will not be able to reopen a water well or dig new wells in their village in the <a href="http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/attractions/central_kalahari_game_reserve.html">Central Kalahari Game Reserve</a> [official website]. The Bushmen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10720244">applied for permission to use a borehole</a> [BBC report], originally dug by diamond company <a href="http://www.debeers.com/us/">De Beers</a> [corporate website] in the 1980s, as a water well on their ancestral land located in the Kalahari desert. Judge Lashkavinder Walia <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCgZCKb8yh3A2lcxXk6nui_pvZCg">denied</a> [AFP report] the tribe's application, stating that they needed to specify how much water they intended to pump from the borehole in order to comply with water regulations and calling on the government to further clarify water regulations. Director of <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/">Survival International</a> [advocacy website], Stephen Corry, <a href="http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/6257">called on tourists and consumers</a> [press release] to consider the country's treatment of its indigenous people before planning trips and making purchases:
<blockquote>In the last ten years Botswana has become one of the harshest places in the world for indigenous peoples. If Bushmen are to be denied water on their lands when it is freely provided for tourists, animals, and diamond mines, then foreigners should be asked if they really want to support this regime with their visits and jewellery [sic] shopping.</blockquote>Tourist areas as well as diamond claims are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iZ6anDs2DjnmVTKodBuzI2vmDDFQD9H3HROG0">located within miles of the game reserve</a> [AP report], and the closest source of water for the Bushmen is 25 miles from their village. The Botswana government has argued that the tribe's village in the game reserve is not a formal settlement and, therefore, the government is not required to provide the Bushmen with water. The Bushmen are considered to be the first inhabitants of southern Africa, with ancestors occupying the Kalahari Desert region for 20,000 years. They are expected to appeal this most recent decision.

<p>The tribe was evicted from the game reserve from 1997 to 2002 and forced to reside in settlement camps. The Bushmen contend the eviction was the result of the government attempting to make room for diamond claims and tourist areas, whereas the government cited the Bushmen's negative effect on conservation as the motivation behind the relocation. The borehole was sealed in 2002 in an additional effort to drive the tribe from the land. In 2006, the High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/botswana-high-court-rules-government.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government's eviction was "unlawful and unconstitutional" and allowed the Bushmen return to the area. Spokesmen for the tribe <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/botswana-tribe-to-bring-land-dispute.php">announced in January</a> [JURIST report] that they plan to take the land dispute issue to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icj.php">news archive</a>] because the government continues to ignore court orders granting land rights. In March, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3203752.stm">Bolivian President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile] called upon the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bolivia-president-urges-un-to-declare.php">declare access to safe drinking water a basic human right</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The signing ceremony comes one week after the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-senate-passes-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">approved by the legislature</a> [JURIST report], making Argentina the first Latin American nation to legalize same-sex marriage. The legislation, which includes adoption rights for same-sex couples, was approved after 14 hours of debate, despite strong opposition from some lawmakers who introduced an alternative bill that would have allowed civil unions nationwide without adoption rights. At the signing ceremony, Fernandez described the bill as <a href="http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=7424">creating a more equal society</a> [statement, in Spanish], stating:<blockquote>I receive this bill in the name of the whole society in Argentina, even on behalf of those that disagree with it. In a few years this debate will be absolutely anachronistic. ... I think [this] constitute[s] a major milestone on the road to equality. ... [W]e have not really passed a law, we have enacted a social construct and a good social construct is diverse, it is plural, broad and does not belong to anyone but those who built it: society.</blockquote>Some Argentine magistrates have stated that they will <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2005678,00.html">not perform same-sex marriages</a> [TIME report], despite threats of dismissal if they refuse. The first same-sex marriage under the new law is scheduled for August 13.

<p>The legislation faced strong opposition from the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm">Catholic Church</a> [official website], which organized protests outside of the capitol building during debate on the bill, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/07/15/world/americas/AP-LT-Argentina-Gay-Marriage.html?_r=1&hp">gathering more than 60,000 people</a> [AP report]. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/cardinali_biografie/cardinali_bio_bergoglio_jm_en.html">Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio</a> [official website] criticized the legislation, stating that it interfered with a child's right to be raised by a mother and father. <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">Freedom to Marry</a> [advocacy website], a US-based same-sex marriage advocacy group, described the passage as a <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/press/press-release/argentina-passes-historic-marriage-bill">"human rights achievement"</a> [press release] demonstrating Argentina's movement to "true democratic values." Recent polling has shown that <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Gay-marriage-bill-splits-Argentina/articleshow/6169278.cms">70 percent</a> [NYT report] of the Argentine public support the legislation. Same-sex marriage is recognized in jurisdictions in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mexico-city-legislature-approves-same.php">Mexico</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">US</a>, and is recognized nationwide in Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/portugal-president-ratifies-same-sex-marriage-law.php">Portugal</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Sweden</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/norway-parliament-approves-same-sex.php">Norway</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iceland-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Iceland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/south-africa-high-court-says-same-sex.php">South Africa</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Martin Feldman issued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-blocks-deepwater-drilling-ban-in-gulf.php">preliminary injunction against the moratorium</a> [JURIST report] last month, holding that the drilling ban caused irreparable harm to the plaintiffs, small oil companies that were harmed by the ban, and that the Obama administration had not considered proper alternatives when issuing the moratorium. The Obama administration has since <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-issues-new-drilling-moratorium.php">issued a new drilling moratorium</a> [JURIST report] affecting only specific types of drilling equipment. Advocacy groups, including the <a href="http://www.defenders.org/index.php">Defenders of Wildlife</a> [advocacy website], asked the judge to consider reinstating the original moratorium because it would have effectively banned all deepwater oil drilling. The newly-issued moratorium will not have such a broad effect. The advocacy groups argued that Feldman <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100721/us_nm/us_oil_spill_moratorium">should be disqualified from the case</a> [Reuters report] because he owned stocks in several oil and drilling companies. Feldman denied the request saying it had no basis in the law. A lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court challenging the Obama administration's new drilling moratorium. 

<p>Earlier this month, the Obama administration asked a federal appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-oil-drilling-ban.php">reinstate the original six-month drilling moratorium</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the ban should be upheld because the government would likely win its appeal of the lower court's ruling. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] originally asked the court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-block-injunction-on-oil-drilling-ban.php">stay the preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] in June, on the basis that another deepwater spill could overwhelm the ongoing efforts to clean up the spill with catastrophic results. Lawyers for the DOJ also claimed that that the district judge <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wirestory?id=11018096&page=1">abused his discretion</a> [Reuters report] in issuing the injunction. More than 120 million gallons of oil have leaked already from the rig's broken pipe and has now surpassed the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=exxon+valdez">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> [JURIST news archive] as the worst in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Also cited by TI for having high rates of corruption were Uganda, with a rate of 33 percent, Kenya at 31.9 percent and Tanzania at 28.6 percent. The survey was expanded this year to include both Burundi and Rwanda. Rwanda was named the least corrupt state in the region, with the incidence of corruption being 6.6 percent. TI found that, apart from Rwanda, corruption in the region significantly impedes the ability of local governments to provide adequate public services. Corruption was found to be prevalent throughout the governments, with particularly problematic areas including security services and the judiciary. The Executive-Director for TI noted the importance of ending corruption in the region stating, "East African countries need to scrutinize their service delivery mechanisms with the objective of rooting out practices such as corruption that are impeding the accessibility of basic services. This will promote equality, development and the reduction of poverty in the region." TI also highlighted the limited reporting of corruption in the countries, indicating that the problem could be more wide-spread than the report suggests. 

<p>Kenya had previously been ranked as the most corrupt country in the region, with a 2009 rate of corruption at 45 percent. In 2008, two judges of Kenya's High Court were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/two-kenya-top-court-judges-fired-for.php">fired from their positions</a> [JURIST report] after two investigatory tribunals found them guilty of corruption. In 2007, Kenyan lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/kenya-lawmakers-limit-corruption.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have limited the <a href="http://www.kacc.go.ke/">Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (KACC) [official website] to investigating crimes committed after 2003. Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/kenya-president-rejects-bill.php">refused to sign the bill</a> [JURIST report], which would have made it impossible for the commission to continue investigations into some of the country's most notorious corruption cases. In a report issued by TI in 2007, lawyers were <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/lawyers-rank-among-most-corrupt-groups.php">ranked among the most corrupt groups</a> [JURIST report] in Kenya.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the third of five detainees that Spain has <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-to-accept-5-guantanamo-detainees.php">agreed to accept</a> [JURIST report].

In a <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM170_100721_conyers.html">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent from Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich to House Judiciary Committee chairman <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official website], Weich detailed the findings of a two-year investigation conducted by a special prosecutor. Although acknowledging that the firings were political, violating "DOJ principles," the investigation found "insufficient evidence" to suggest that any Bush-era officials had violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001503----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &#167; 1503 text] by firing the attorneys to influence the pace of the prosecution of political opponents. Additionally, the investigation found that despite "inaccurate and misleading" statements by former attorney general <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/gonzales-bio.html">Alberto Gonzales</a> [official profile] during the investigation and congressional testimony, there was not enough evidence to establish that he or other DOJ officials had "knowingly made material false statements to ... Congress or corruptly endeavored to obstruct justice," which would also constitute a violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001001----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &#167; 1001(a) text]. Reacting to the letter, Gonzales's attorney <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/us/politics/22justice.html?_r=1">described it as a vindication</a> [NYT report], stating that the attorneys were political appointees that could be removed at the whim of the president. In his reaction to the letter, Conyers said that it is not an exoneration, but that the findings reaffirmed the impropriety of the firings and confirmed the Bush administration's attempted cover up.

<p>Gonzales' successor, <a href="http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=9cbb337b-188c-4113-8397-510b95f750ad&type=showfullbio">Michael Mukasey</a> [professional profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/mukasey-names-prosecutor-to-investigate.php">appointed the special prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008 to determine whether criminal charges were warranted in connection with the firings. The move was recommended in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by investigators at the DOJ. The report was one of several internal assessments of the role politics played in DOJ hiring and firing practices. In July 2008, the Inspector General and Professional Responsibility offices concluded that DOJ officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-report-says-officials-employed.php">made illegal hiring decisions</a> [JURIST report] based on applicants' political and ideological beliefs. In November 2009, the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/house-committee-documents-show-rove.php">released testimony and e-mails</a> [JURIST report] purporting to show that Bush administration political adviser <a href="http://www.rove.com/">Karl Rove</a> [personal website] was involved in the firings. Citing executive privilege, Rove refused to testify in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/rove-fails-to-appear-at-senate.php>July 2007</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/rove-defies-subpoena-to-testify-on-doj.php">July 2008</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/07/22/i-saw-it-my-own-eyes-0">"I Saw It With My Own Eyes"</a> [materials], HRW said that the Chinese government violated the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/firearms.htm">UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials</a> [text], which limits the use of force to that which is strictly necessary to protect life or to apprehend perpetrators of violent crimes. Chinese officials reportedly violated this by using disproportionate force, including opening fire on protesters on at least four occasions and conducting large-scale arrests. The Chinese government also violated international law in its handling of suspects held for involvement in the demonstrations by torturing and brutalizing them, not revealing the conditions in which suspects were held and not allowing the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [advocacy website] to visit them, according to HRW. The report explained:<blockquote>Such tactics are unlikely to resolve, and may even aggravate, the longstanding grievances that prompted the protests in the first place, undermining prospects for long-term stability in the region. China urgently needs to investigate the protests and their aftermath, and open the region to media and international monitors. It also needs to examine the conduct of its security forces, which eyewitnesses consistently say used disproportionate force; deliberately brutalized and mistreated Tibetans[;] ... and deprived detainees of minimum guarantees of due process of law, including formal notification of where, or why, they were held.</blockquote>HRW went on to call for the Chinese government to release of all Tibetan detainees that have not been charged with a crime and to release accurate statistics about all Tibetans held and about the number of casualties. The report also urged the international community to pressure China to end forced disappearances, prosecute those who carried out the human rights abuses and allow an investigation into the violence to be conducted by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website].

<p>In March 2009, HRW reported that the Chinese government has <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/rights-group-claims-china-has-not-fully.php">not accounted for hundreds of Tibetan protesters</a> [JURIST report] arrested in connection with the March 2008 demonstrations, revealing a thorough review regarding the numbers of arrests, detentions and trials of the protesters. There were allegedly several hundred protesters still in custody and documents have revealed that, contrary to information supplied by the Chinese government, several demonstrators died after the March 2008 demonstrations. To date there has been no public information regarding the trials of the remaining demonstrators. In June 2008, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/china-reports-release-of-tibetan.php">released more than 1000 demonstrators</a> [JURIST report] detained by authorities during the demonstrations against Chinese rule in Tibet, two days after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on China to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/tibetan-protesters-missing-after.php">free all detainees who engaged in peaceful protest</a> [JURIST report]. Chinese officials have blamed the exiled <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/">Dalai Lama</a> [personal website] for organizing the protests. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Serbia argued that <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/press/reports/N9917289.pdf">UN Resolution 1244</a> [text, PDF], which ended the war in Kosovo, solidified the country's boundaries, which included the southern region of Kosovo. Kosovo argued that the resolution was not meant to exclude the opportunity for secession. ICJ President Hisashi Owada read the opinion of the court, stating that nothing in international law prohibits a unilateral declaration of independence. The outcome of the proceedings is non-binding, but could have far-reaching implications for other countries with territories seeking recognition as independent states. Serbia was backed by a majority of UN countries, including Russia, China and Spain, but Kosovo has consistently been supported by the US and most European countries. After the ruling, Kosovo officials indicated that Serbia must now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10730573">address the country as a sovereign state</a> [BBC report]. Serbian <a href="http://www.predsednik.rs/mwc/default.asp?c=101000&g=20060904141200&lng=eng&hs1=0">President Boris Tadic</a> [official profile] maintained that Serbia will <a href="http://www.predsednik.rs/mwc/default.asp?c=303000&g=20100722191249&lng=cir&hs1=0">not recognize</a> [statement, in Serbian] Kosovo's independence, claiming the ICJ ruling was limited only to the question of whether the declaration itself violated international law, and not whether the secession was legal. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/presscom/menu.php?p1=6&p2=8&lang=en">advisory proceedings</a> [materials], which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icj-begins-advisory-prcoeedings-on.php">began in December</a> [JURIST report], included arguments from 29 additional countries, including the five member-states of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], debating whether Kosovo's unilaterally proclaimed secession complied with international law. In an effort to further the legitimacy of its independence, Kosovo began operations of its own judicial system in 2009. In March of that year, more than 100 Serbian judges, prosecutors and legal professionals <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/first-eu-kosovo-trial-blocked-by.php">prevented the opening</a> [JURIST report] of the first EU-backed trial in Kosovo by protesting in front of the Mitrovica court house. A panel of three judges had been set to preside over a criminal case involving two Serbian defendants. As Serbia and Kosovo's Serbian population have refused to accept Kosovo's independence, the demonstration was <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=03&dd=02&nav_id=57524">intended to bar the EU from holding trial</a> [B92 report] in Kosovo except under UN laws. The trial court was established by <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website], an EU mission designed to guide Kosovo toward independence in accordance with the Rule of Law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The study, "Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific," commissioned by the UNDP and the <a href="http://www.msmasia.org/">Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health</a> (APCOM) [advocacy website], was presented at the <a href="http://www.aids2010.org/">International AIDS Conference</a> [official website] held this week in Vienna. Among its findings were that laws against public disorder and vagrancy were often used exclusively against homosexual men and transgender people. Additionally, other legal provisions are used in an arbitrary manner to infringe on the rights of homosexuals, creating an environment where HIV treatment efforts are obstructed. Jeff O'Malley, Director of UNDP's HIV Practice elaborated:<blockquote>[R]epressive legal environments institutionalize discrimination, limit funding and in effect obstruct the participation of men who have sex with men and transgender people in protecting themselves and their families, friends and communities from HIV. In the context of HIV and in the context of human rights, we must continue to vigorously defend and promote rights based HIV, health and development policies and programme responses - this necessitates working to remove punitive laws and discriminatory practices.</blockquote>The report noted, however, that there is a rising awareness of the need to address this segment of the population among policymakers, leading to national strategies to deal with the growing problem.

<p>The report comes one month after the launch of the <a href="http://www.undp.org/hiv/comissiononhivandthelaw/index.shtml">Global Commission on HIV and the Law</a>, created by the UNDP and the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/AboutUNAIDS/Secretariat/default.asp">UNAIDS Secretariat</a> [official websites] in order to better <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-launches-global-commission-on-hiv-and-the-law.php">understand the role played by the law</a> [JURIST report] in facilitating universal access to AIDS prevention and treatment. The commission is charged with developing "actionable and evidence-informed recommendations" to create national legal environments with effective and efficient HIV/AIDS responses. The commission is composed of an international panel of experts that is expected to complete its inquiry by December 2011. UNAIDS has repeatedly urged policy changes in the 51 countries and areas that still bar entry to individuals with HIV/AIDS. In April, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/china-lifts-hivaids-entry-ban.php">Chinese government lifted a ban on entry</a> [JURIST report] for individuals with HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-hivaids-travel-ban-lifted.php">US lifted its 22 year-old entry ban</a> [JURIST report] in January when the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a> [official website] removed HIV/AIDS from its list of communicable diseases of public significance. UNAIDS strongly opposes any laws that restrict movement based on HIV-positive status, holding that such restrictions are discriminatory and do not prevent HIV transmission or protect public health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Latif, who has been in custody for over eight years, contends that he was in Pakistan for medical treatment when he was arrested and turned over to US forces. According to a lawyer for Latif, he <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/21/1741207/yemeni-psych-patient-ordered-freed.html">suffers from mental illness</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] and depression, and he remains suicidal. The judge ordered the Obama administration to take all necessary steps to ensure that Latif is released. In a separate decision announced Wednesday, a federal judge denied the <em>habeas</em> petition of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/223-abdul-rahman-abdul-abu-ghityh-sulayman">Abdul-Rahman Sulayman</a> [NYT profile], ruling that he can continue to be held in custody indefinitely. Sulayman has also been in custody for over eight years. The rulings in both cases remain under seal as they are examined for possible security issues. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] is considering whether to appeal the ruling in Latif's case. 

<p>The district court has ruled in favor of the government in 15 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+habeas"><em>habeas corpus</em> cases</a> [JURIST news archive], while Guantanamo detainees have prevailed in 38 cases. Earlier this month, a court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-federal-appeals-court-overturns-guantanamo-habeas-grant.php">overturned a decision granting <em>habeas</em> relief</a> [JURIST report] to detainee Mohammed al-Adahi, ruling that the evidence, viewed as a whole, supported the conclusion that al-Adahi was part of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Also this month, the appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">affirmed a lower court ruling denying <em>habeas corpus</em> relief</a> [JURIST report] to Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=odah">Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad Al Odah</a> [JURIST news archive], ruling there was sufficient evidence to consider him part of al Qaeda. In May, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dc-circuit-denies-guantanamo-detainee-habeas-petition.php">district court ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/681-mohammed-mohammed-hassen">Mohammed Hassen</a> [NYT profile]. Hassen had been initially detained in March 2002 following a raid in Faisalabad by Pakistani security forces. He has maintained throughout his detention that he had traveled to Pakistan to study the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/">Qur'an</a> [text] at Salafi University and had no knowledge of al Qaeda prior to his detention. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The former prisoners were held during the 1980s by the government of former Kenyan president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2161868.stm">Daniel Arap Moi</a> [BBC profile], who ruled from 1978-2002, and subjected to torture in the Nyayo torture chambers. In finding that their rights had been violated, Judge Hannah Okwengu said that the government had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10721384">violated their right to liberty and freedom from torture</a> [BBC report]. The political prisoners alleged that during their time in detention they had been left in the chambers without food or water and had been hung from the ceiling and beaten by police after being charged with treason and associating with an unlawful society. The government argued that the lawsuit had been filed too late and the court should refer the case to the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The court rejected both arguments, stating that the case was not within the jurisdiction of the commission. The suit was filed in 2004 after the original suit was postponed by the court in 1988, finding that they had to wait until the Moi regime had left power. The government will <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya%20torture%20victims%20compensated/-/1056/962524/-/a4j3ugz/-/">appeal the ruling</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em> report].

<p>The Kenyan government announced in November 2008 that it was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/dnp-kenya-government-responds-to-un.php">taking initiatives to eliminate torture</a> [JURIST report] and other inhumane treatment after the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">UN Committee on Torture</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/AB0C50EB3DDBD8CCC1257500003B7B14?OpenDocument">report</a> [text] on violence that occurred in the country in late 2007 and early 2008. The report highlighted cases of gender-based violence and gang rapes by police and other security forces, and discussed police corruption among other rights-related problems. Kenyan Minister for Justice, National Cohesion and Constitutional Affairs Martha Karua said that since 2003 the government has closed torture chambers, amended its criminal laws and made it easier to citizens to report abusive acts. The previous month, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-president-appoints-commission-to.php">commission established</a> [JURIST report] by Kenyan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7079210.stm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [BBC profile] to review the events following the 2008 presidential election released a report recommending the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/kenya-election-violence-commission.php">establishment of an international tribunal</a> [JURIST report] to try those involved.

Last week, the ICC charged al-Bashir with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">report</a>] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The genocide charges were added to seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">filed against al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009. Al-Bashir is in Chad to take part in a meeting of the <a href="http://www.cen-sad.org/">Community of Sahel-Saharan States</a> (CEN-SAD) [official website], and the visit is his first to an ICC member state since the warrants were issued. Ocampo said that al-Bashir <a href="http://english.ntdtv.com/ntdtv_en/ns_europe/2010-07-23/006934587212.html">remains a threat to the security of the region</a> [NTDT report] and indicated that, if al-Bashir continues traveling to other countries, he will eventually be arrested. Ocampo's call for al-Bashir's arrest echoed calls made earlier in the week by advocacy groups urging Chad to detain al-Bashir. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday urged the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-calls-for-al-bashir-arrest-during-his-visit-to-chad.php">government of Chad to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report], contending that because Chad is a party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], it has an obligation under the statute to execute outstanding arrest warrants issued by the ICC. Prior to his visit, the government of Chad indicated that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iirOh1mSFcbkLEeuwinDtcE5mqNw">al-Bashir would not be arrested</a> [AFP report] while he was in the country to take part in the CEN-SAD meetings. During their meeting on Thursday, CEN-SAD <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=135889&sectionid=351020504">refuted the charges against al-Bashir</a> [DB/MMN report], saying that the situation in Darfur remains of great concern but that the accusations against al-Bashir will not help to bring peace to the region. 

<p>The recent charges against al-Bashir come after the appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">reversed a prior decision</a> [JURIST report] by the lower chamber denying the prosecutor's request for genocide charges. ICC prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-prosecutors-appeal-decision-not-to.php">appealed the decision</a> [JURIST report] not to charge al-Bashir with genocide in July 2009. The appeals chamber found that the standard of proof applied by the lower chamber had been too high, and that there only needed to be a showing of reasonable grounds of a genocidal specific intent, a showing that had been met when the first arrest warrant was issued. The warrant issued last week alleges that the Sudanese government, using the national armed forces, police and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3613953.stm">Janjaweed militia</a> [BBC backgrounder], targeted ethnic groups for extermination that were believed to be close to armed opposition groups in Darfur as part of a counter-insurgency strategy, and that as commander-in-chief of Sudanese forces, Bashir "played an essential role in [its] coordinati[on]." Al-Bashir has eluded arrest since the issuance of the first warrant. The warrant has been controversial, with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-joins-calls-for-icc-to-delay.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> and others calling for the proceedings against Bashir to be delayed, and African Union leaders <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/au-leaders-agree-not-to-cooperate-with.php">agreeing</a> [JURIST reports] not to cooperate with the warrant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government accused the website of helping spark the riots by posting information on ethnic violence in China unemployment and discrimination against Uighurs in Xianjiang. Niyaz did not deny writing the posts or speaking to foreign media but insisted that he did not break the law. The sentence has been <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE66M1OX20100723?sp=true">described as unusually long</a> [Reuters report] for someone not facing charges of separatism or extremism. Niyaz was detained along with a number of other Uighur publishers following the riots. On Thursday, the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website] called on the Chinese government to <a href="http://cpj.org/2010/07/uighur-journalist-goes-on-trial-in-china-a-year-af.php">drop the charges</a> [press release] against Niyaz, saying that he was being prosecuted for his work as a journalist.

<p>In January, the Urumqi court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-court-sentences-4-more-to-death.php">sentenced four people to death</a> [JURIST report], eight others to life in prison and one to the death penalty with a two-year reprieve, which is usually commuted to life in prison, for their roles in the riots. To date, at least 26 people have received death sentences. In November, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-executes-9-convicted-of-xinjiang.php">carried out the executions</a> [JURIST report] of nine others convicted in connection with the riots for murder, assault, arson and robbery, after a review by the <a href="http://court.gov.cn/">Supreme People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese] upheld their sentences. The actions of the Chinese government in the aftermath of the riots were <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-xinjiang-riot-trials-fail-to-meet.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsenateseal.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] will not pass broad climate legislation during this session, according to statements made Thursday by Senate <a href="http://www.reid.senate.gov/">Majority Leader Harry Reid</a> (D-NV) [official website]. Reid said that the body <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10739800">lacks the 60 votes necessary</a> [BBC report] to end debate on the bill and pass the legislation, but also indicated that he would attempt to pass a smaller bill focused on energy efficiency, promoting the use of natural gas, and increased deepwater drilling regulations. The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/house-passes-climate-bill-as-obama.php">passed its version of the climate bill</a> [JURIST report] last year. Several versions of climate change legislation have been negotiated and debated in the Senate. Last month, <a href="http://lugar.senate.gov/">Senator Richard Lugar</a> (R-IN) introduced <a href="http://lugar.senate.gov/energy/legislation/pdf/EnergyBill.pdf">legislation</a> [S 3464 text, PDF] intended to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/republican-lawmaker-introduces-energy-legislation.php">reduce foreign oil dependence</a> [JURIST report] and cut greenhouse gas emissions. An <a href="http://energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=IssueItems.Detail&IssueItem_ID=1fbce5ed-7447-42ff-9dc2-5b785a98ad80">energy bill</a> [S 1462 materials], including amendments aimed at decreasing dependence on foreign oil imports, passed out of committee with Republican support in 2009, but key Republicans supporting that legislation have since withdrawn their support. Senators <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/">John Kerry</a> (D-MA) and <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official websites] also worked on developing a <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/work/issues/issue/?id=7f6b4d4a-da4a-409e-a5e7-15567cc9e95c">comprehensive bill</a> [materials] that would have included a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14231/debate_over_greenhouse_gas_capandtrade.html">cap-and-trade</a> [CFR backgrounder] scheme, but efforts stalled after <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/">Senator Lindsay Graham</a> (R-SC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/senate-climate-change-bill-delayed-as.php">withdrew his support in April</a> [JURIST report], citing concerns that the Obama administration planned on moving forward on comprehensive <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration reform</a> [JURIST news archive]. It is unclear whether Reid will be able to garner the votes necessary to pass the smaller bill. 

<p>The Senate's failure to pass comprehensive climate legislation will likely revive the debate over the authority of administrative agencies like the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] to implement standards aimed at reducing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greenhouse+gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last month, the Senate defeated a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.J.Res.26:">resolution</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-senate-blocks-measure-aimed-at-preventing-epa-regulation-of-carbon-emissions.php">report</a>] aimed at limiting the authority of the EPA to regulate emissions under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> [materials]. Supporters of the resolution argued that Congress, and not the EPA, should have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] affirmed the EPA's ability to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act in its 2007 ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/05-1120">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">report</a>]. In its ruling, the court held that if the EPA could show a link between greenhouse gas emissions and public health and welfare then the act gives it the power to regulate emissions. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">announced last December</a> [JURIST report] that it had found that greenhouse gases "threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations," and that emissions from motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. The EPA first <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/epa-announces-proposed-findings-for.php">announced its proposed finding</a> [JURIST report] in April before undertaking a 60-day public comment period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Thursday seeking to force Montana to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. The lawsuit, filed in Montana's <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/locator/dist1.mcpx">First Judicial District Court</a> [official website] on behalf of seven same-sex couples, seeks declaratory judgment that the state must provide a legal status to same-sex couples that confers the same rights and obligations as marriage. The complaint argues that, in not providing a legal status to committed same-sex relationships, the state has violated the plaintiffs' rights under the <a href="http://leg.mt.gov/css/Laws%20and%20Constitution/Current%20Constitution.asp">Montana Constitution</a> [text]. The lawsuit does not argue for <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a>, which is banned under the state constitution, but argues that the court should order the state to provide same-sex couples with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">civil unions</a> [JURIST news archives]. The ACLU argues that the state is discriminating against the plaintiffs based on their sexual orientation and that this situation unconstitutionally burdens the plaintiffs' rights to privacy, dignity and the pursuit of life's basic necessities, in addition to violating their state due process rights. The rights group noted that state and local laws provide some limited rights and obligations to same-sex couples, but deny them a plethora of benefits that are available to opposite-sex couples, including burial rights, hospital visitation rights, intestacy rights and the ability to sue for the wrongful death of a spouse. The complaint explained:<blockquote>By excluding Plaintiffs and their families from the kind of comprehensive relationship and family recognition and protection offered to different-sex couples through marriage, the State perpetuates the social stigma and prejudice long-suffered by lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in Montana, that they and their relationships are inferior to heterosexual individuals and heterosexual relationships. This exclusion also encourages discrimination against lesbian, gay, and bisexual Montanans, by both public and private actors. As described above, Plaintiffs suffer distinct dignitary harms when they are forced to plead for recognition of their committed relationship, which is automatically granted to different-sex couples who marry.</blockquote>The ACLU also argued that the policy was not rational or narrowly tailored to achieve legitimate state goals.

<p>Earlier this month, Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov">Governor Linda Lingle</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed same-sex civil unions. The <a href="http://www.acluhawaii.org/">American Civil Liberties Union-Hawaii</a> (ACLU-HI) [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.acluhawaii.org/news.php?id=391&PHPSESSID=a5bd9f81a8d768f91ba038d73fc50764">indicated it would be filing a lawsuit</a> [press release] challenging the state's ban on same-sex civil unions as a violation of the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/lrb/con/">Hawaiian Constitution</a> [text] prohibition against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Several jurisdictions in the US have legalized same-sex marriage or recognized same-sex civil unions. Same-sex civil unions that confer the same rights as marriage are currently recognized in <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">Washington</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-jersey-civil-unions-bill-signed.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oregon-gay-rights-bills-signed-into-law.php">Oregon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/nevada-legislature-passes-same-sex.php">Nevada</a> [JURIST reports]. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">DC</a> legalized same-sex marriage, joining <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, known as the Disclose Act, was developed in response to the January US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruling in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], which eased restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations. If signed into law, the bill would prohibit corporations receiving federal contracts worth more than $7 million from spending money on "electioneering communications" and would also prohibit foreign-controlled domestic corporations from financing campaigns. The new version of the bill removes several provisions included in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-approves-campaign-finance-reform-legislation.php">version passed by the US House of Representatives</a> [JURIST report] last month, including exemptions in the bill which may <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/110401-schumer-files-new-version-of-campaign-finance-bill-to-court-centrists">benefit unions over corporations</a> [The <em>Hill</em> report]. Another provision added to the amended legislation would require organizations funding political advertising in states where they do not do business to disclose the location of the organization. The Senate is scheduled to begin debate on the bill on Monday and could vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. It is unclear whether Democrats will have the 60 votes needed for cloture on the bill. 

<p>Senate Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to.php">first introduced their version of the Disclose Act</a> [JURIST report] in April after the Senate <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">held hearings</a> [JURIST report] in March on the effects of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision. In <u>Citizens United</u>, the court struck down Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an "electioneering communication" or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">sharply criticized</a> [JURIST report] the decision in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address">State of the Union Address</a> [transcript] in January. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. The decision has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/21/campaign.finance.ruling/index.html?iref=allsearch">caused a deep partisan divide</a> [CNN report] over the topic, with Democratic officials largely opposing the decision, and Republican officials mostly in support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc909257.pdf">appealed the decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-prosecutors-appeal-order-releasing-congo-militia-leader-lubanga.php">report</a>] to release Lubanga, arguing that it was unlikely he would be able to be located and re-detained upon resumption of the trial. The court agreed with the prosecution's argument, ruling that:<blockquote>[A]n immediate implementation of the order to release [Lubanga] could render the resumption of the trial uncertain, should the Appeals Chamber later find in favour of the Prosecutor's appeals against the Decision to Stay Proceedings and the Impugned Decision. In these circumstances, his release could potentially defeat the purpose of the present appeal and that of the appeal against the Decision to Stay Proceedings, and the granting of suspensive effect is therefore appropriate.</blockquote>Lubanga will remain in ICC custody until the appeals chamber rules on the suspension of the trial. 

<p>Lubanga is accused of war crimes for allegedly recruiting child soldiers to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2002-2003. His trial began in January 2009 but was halted soon after when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST report] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] last July after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintains he is innocent</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against him. He became the first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC, formed in 2002, after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in March 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcapitol.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] introduced <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/demint.net.neutrality.bill.072110.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday intended to block the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. Additionally, it would force all FCC regulations on providers' activities to expire after five years unless it is found that market forces would not "protect consumers from substantial injury." In explaining the need for the legislation, DeMint stated that it was <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=cd4ae03f-e260-438d-8e3f-903c8112b625&ContentType_id=a2165b4b-3970-4d37-97e5-4832fcc68398&Group_id=9ee606ce-9200-47af-90a5-024143e9974c&MonthDisplay=7&YearDisplay=2010">necessary</a> [press release] to prevent "FCC's rush to takeover the Internet" and stated:<blockquote>Congress must pass the [act] to protect consumer choice in media services, preserve competition that drives down costs and drives up options, and prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs that the free market Internet economy has created. President Obama's handpicked FCC chairman is attempting to impose unnecessary, antiquated regulations on the Internet in spite of court rulings limiting the FCC's authority, against bipartisan congressional concern over damaging economic consequences, and without any evidence of market failure. The [act] will ensure that the FCC properly uses its rulemaking authority to respond to clear cases of competitive market failure that have proven to harm consumers, and this principle should be the starting point for any debate on Internet governance.</blockquote>The legislation was co-sponsored by six other Republicans. One co-sponsor, <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/">Senator John Cornyn</a> (R-TX) [official website] described the legislation as <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=58901352-19bf-4c08-9c80-1e75e812c66b&ContentType_id=b94acc28-404a-4fc6-b143-a9e15bf92da4&Group_id=24eb5606-e2db-4d7f-bf6c-efc5df80b676">"vital to maintaining jobs"</a> [press release]. It comes two months after <a href="http://www.stearns.house.gov/">Representative Cliff Stearns</a> (R-FL) <a href="http://thehill.com/news-by-subject/technology/97235-rep-stearns-trying-to-block-fcc-on-broadband-regulation">introduced similar legislation</a> [The <em>Hill</em> report] in the House of Representatives.

<p>In April, FCC <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Chairman Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] testified that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/fcc-going-forward-with-broadband-plan.php">agency will move ahead</a> [JURIST report] with its National Broadband Plan despite a recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that it lacks the power to enforce <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">net neutrality</a> [JURIST news archive]. Net neutrality, which is <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">unanimously supported</a> [JURIST report] by the FCC's commissioners, is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. Telecommunications companies <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites] argue that net neutrality would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic. Genachowski said that the FCC's actions, as laid out in the plan will, "protect America's global competitiveness and help deliver the extraordinary benefits of broadband to all Americans." The roadmap, he continued, falls within the framework of the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">Communications Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF] as amended in 1996. The FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fcc-presents-broadband-regulation-plan.php">sent the plan to Congress</a> [JURIST report] for approval in March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/darbenin-adi-balyoz.htm">2003 Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [Taraf report, in Turkish; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">backgrounder</a>], or "Sledgehammer" plot, which included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane in order to undermine the government, was revealed by the <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/"><em>Taraf</em></a> [media website] newspaper in January. The Istanbul <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/turkey.htm">10th Court for Serious Crimes</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] ordered the arrests after another court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/turkish-court-indicts-196-in-connection-to-coup-plot.php">indicted 196</a> [JURIST report] over the plot on Monday. The first hearing in the case is <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=arrest-warrant-issued-for-102-names-in-sledgehammer-2010-07-23">set for December 16</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report]. The indictment was accepted by the Istanbul 12th High Criminal Court Monday and alleges that the plot was crafted in an Istanbul army base shortly after the <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] took power in November 2002. Prosecutors are calling for <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE66I4J020100719">prison sentences of 15 to 20 years</a> [Reuters report] for the defendants. The military has maintained that the plot is a war game exercise. In February, a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">charged an additional 11 military officers</a> [JURIST report] in the plot and arrested 18 more. Also in February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/twelve-turkish-military-officers.php">40 military officers and 12 high-ranking Turkish military officers</a> [JURIST reports] were arrested and charged for their involvement in the plot.

<p>In June, the trial of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">33 retired and active naval officers began</a> [JURIST report]. The officers were accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule in another plot planned by a group called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>]. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the AKP. Prosecutors in the case will <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/10320736.stm">attempt to link</a> [BBC report] the 33 defendants to a plan to detonate a bomb in an Istanbul museum and the deaths of a Catholic priest, Protestant missionaries and journalist Hrant Dink. The investigations have strained relations between the religiously-inclined government and the secular military, which has been responsible for four coups in the last 50 years. Since the founding of the modern republic in 1923, the military has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/29/turkey.islam">regarded itself as the defender</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of the secular legacy of founder <a href="http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [Turkish News profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Conahan, the former president judge of the <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website], <a href="http://citizensvoice.com/conahan-pleads-guilty-to-racketeering-charge-1.900067">pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges</a> [<em>Citizens Voice</em> report] for accepting more than $2.6 million in return for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities. Conahan now faces a 20-year prison sentence, a fine of up to $250,000 and disbarment. The date of his sentencing has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5itWVMibvMht_cZI-MbMwLm66QDFgD9H4S3LO3">not been set</a> [AP report]. Judge Edwin Kosik had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/25judge.html?_r=3">previously rejected</a> [NYT report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and former judge Mark Ciavarella Jr., finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. An attorney for Ciavarella said that he maintains his innocence and intends to go to trial.

<p>In April, US Attorney Dennis Pfannenschmidt announced that <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/pam/press_releases/Reilly_04_16_10.htm">28 people have been charged</a> [press release] with soliciting and receiving bribes and gratuities in connection with the scandal. Luzerne County <a href="http://www.luzernecounty.org/county/row_offices/district_attorney">District Attorney Jacqueline Musto Carroll</a> [official website] agreed in January to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pennsylvania-prosecutor-will-not-retry.php">drop efforts to retry 46 juveniles</a> whose original <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">convictions were overturned</a> [JURIST reports] because they had been issued by a judge indicted in the scandal. This decision ended all efforts at retrying any of the convicted juveniles, who will now have their juvenile records cleared. The Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.jlc.org/news/31/no_retrials/">applauded the decision</a> [press release], indicating that "justice has finally been attained" for the juveniles. In October, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/T/SupremeCourt/">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] overturned about 6,500 convictions handed down by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, but gave prosecutors permission to seek retrial of more than 100 youths who were still under court supervision. Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the guilty pleas they <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">entered</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case arose after Vancouver lawyer Cameron Ward was mistakenly arrested for making threats against then-prime minister <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/07/13/f-jean-chretien.html">Jean Chretien</a> [CBC profile]. Ward was detained and eventually arrested for breach of the peace, and he and his car were searched based on the mistaken arrest. Ward filed a lawsuit alleging tort violations and violations of his Charter rights. The trial court found that the search and seizure conducted under the mistaken arrest were a violation of Ward's Charter rights and granted him monetary damages. The Supreme Court was asked to identify when and what types of damages were appropriate for Charter rights violations. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's ruling, stating that the search violated Ward's rights and that monetary damages were the appropriate remedy for the violation. The court held that determining the appropriate remedy for a violation of Charter rights is a three-step process involving an inquiry into whether the rights were violated, a showing of why damages are an appropriate remedy and the opportunity for the government to refute the appropriateness of the damages. If there was a violation of rights, and if damages are an appropriate remedy for fulfilling the related functions of either compensation, vindication of the right or deterrence, then damages should be awarded by the court. 

<p>Friday's ruling is likely to have broad implications going forward and could play a role in lawsuits filed against the Canadian government following the recent <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/G20/">Toronto Group of 20 (G-20) summit</a> [official website]. Rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/canada-rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into-g-20-security-measures.php">called for an inquiry into possible rights violations</a> [JURIST report] during the summit, condemning police conduct as "arbitrary and excessive" and criticizing the enactment of a <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/regs/english/2010/elaws_src_regs_r10233_e.htm">local regulation</a> [O Reg 233/10 text] under the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90p55_e.htm">Public Works Protection Act</a> [text], which broadened the scope of police search and seizure powers during the summit. The <a href="http://www.ombudsman.on.ca/">Ontario Ombudsman</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/canada-government-accountability-officer-to-probe-g-20-security-measures.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the enactment of the regulation earlier this month. Some legal experts have indicated that implementation of the regulation <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829917--cabinet-secrecy-opens-door-to-legal-challenge">may have been a violation</a> [Toronto Star report] of Charter rights. In light of Friday's ruling, plaintiffs suing the government for a violation of their rights may now be entitled to damages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNHRC announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-council-condemns-israel-attack-and-calls-for-independent-investigation.php">formation of the commission</a> [JURIST report] in June, shortly after the incident, with the mandate to "investigate violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law." The three-member panel will be composed of Sir Desmond de Silva of the UK, a former prosecutor for the UN-backed <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a>; Karl Hudson-Phillips of Trinidad and Tobago, a former judge at the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC); and Mary Shanth Dairiam of Malaysia, a former member of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</a> [official websites]. Announcing the members, UNHRC President, Thai Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, explained:<blockquote>The expertise, independence and impartiality of the members of the mission will be devoted to clarifying the events which took place that day and their legality. We call upon all parties to fully cooperate with the mission and hope that this mission will contribute to peace in the region and justice for the victims.</blockquote>The mission is expected to travel to Turkey, Israel and Gaza in the near future and present their findings on the incident in September. Israel has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/07/2010723142931310192.html">not indicated whether it will cooperate</a> [Al Jazeera report] with the investigation, but has repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-rejects-international-inquiry-into-flotilla-attack.php">rejected calls</a> for an international investigation, instead <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-launches-internal-probe-of-flotilla-attack.php">conducting an internal investigation</a> [JURIST reports]. 

<p>Earlier this month, an Israeli military probe <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">found insufficient intelligence and planning</a> [JURIST report] in the raid in a report, but also concluded that no punishments were necessary. The report also pointed out the operation relied "excessively on a single course of action ... while no alternative courses of action were prepared for the event of more dangerous scenarios." It went on to commend the actions of the soldiers and their commanders, who exhibited "correct decision making" and justifiably resorted to the use of their firearms. Last month, Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-appoints-former-supreme-court-judge-to-head-flotilla-raid-probe.php">established a panel of jurists</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the attack independently from the IDF investigation. The panel has not yet completed its investigation. Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza in May. The raid left numerous wounded and resulted in the deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists - eight Turks and one American.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint, filed by <a href="http://www.ctia.org/">CTIA</a> [official website] in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], argues that the ordinance unlawfully interferes with the exclusive authority of the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] to regulate radio frequency (RF) emissions from mobile devices like cell phones. The complaint claims that the ordinance is preempted based on the Supremacy Clause for three basic reasons: first, it interferes with the federal government's authority to set standards for RF emissions; second, it disrupts Congress' ability to set uniform nationwide standards for "safe" cell phones; and third, it is expressly preempted by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000332----000-.html">Section 332(c)(3)(A) of the Communications Act</a> [text], which prohibits state imposed limits on "entry" into the wireless market through things like labeling requirements. CTIA <a href="http://www.ctia.org/media/press/body.cfm/prid/1989">argues</a> [press release] that the FCC set Standard Absorption Rate (SAR) limits for RF emissions and that all cell phones sold legally in the US are "safe":<blockquote>The problem with the San Francisco ordinance is not the disclosure of wireless phone SAR values - that information is already publicly available. Consumers can learn a device's SAR value from a number of public sources, and the value is often included in user manuals and listed on the websites of manufacturers and the FCC. CTIA's objection to the ordinance is that displaying a phone's SAR value at the point-of-sale suggests to the consumer that there is a meaningful safety distinction between FCC-compliant devices with different SAR levels.</blockquote>Supporters of the ordinance claim that it will make consumers more informed when purchasing a cell phone.

<p>Last month, the San Francisco <a href="http://www.sfbos.org/index.aspx?page=1">Board of Supervisors</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/san-francisco-board-approves-cell-phone-radiation-ordinance.php">voted 10-1 to approve</a> [JURIST report] the ordinance, which is expected to take effect early next year. The safety of cell phone radiation levels has been a topic of debate, and, while San Francisco is the first to pass legislation on the issue, similar legislation has been considered by <a href="http://www.mainelegislature.org/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280035199">Maine</a> and <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=sb_1212&sess=CUR&house=B&site=sen">California</a> [materials]. Recently, more legislative concern has been focused on the danger of texting while driving. Earlier this year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/un-sg-calls-for-global-ban-on-using-cell-phones-while-driving.php">global ban on cell phone use</a> [JURIST report] while driving. In October, Ontario enacted a law <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/10/ontario-law-banning-use-of-handheld.php">banning the use of handheld devices</a> [JURIST report] while driving, joining other jurisdictions in Canada and the US to pass similar bans including Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador, California and New York.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Humberto Palacios <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/23/AR2010072305086.html">dismissed the charges</a> [AP report] because of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-president-pardons-military.php">amnesty</a> [JURIST report] granted to those involved in Zelaya's removal by the Honduran congress in January. Zelaya still faces other charges including fraud, usurping other institutions' authority and falsifying documents. Honduras remains split over the events of June 28, 2009, when Zelaya was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">forced into exile</a>. Many still support Zelaya and believe him to be the legitimate leader of the country. The Popular National Resistance Front (FNRP), which supports Zelaya's return to power, is <a href="http://www.hondurasweekly.com/national/2757-fnrp-bid-for-party-status-backed-by-lobo">seeking to be recognized</a> [Hondurasweekly report] as an official political party within Honduras and has grown under the banner of creating an assembly to review and rewrite the country's constitution.

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] accused the Honduran government of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-honduras-to-investigate-violations-stemming-from-2009-coup.php">failing to address human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] stemming from the June 2009 coup. AI contends that hundreds of people opposed to the coup have been beaten and detained. The group cited evidence that judges critical of the coup have "suffered a series of arbitrary transferrals and unfair disciplinary proceedings" as well as threats and intimidation. The interim government has been attempting to restore Honduras's reputation internationally. In May, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] announced that Honduras <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/honduras-drops-suit-against-brazil-for-sheltering-ousted-president-zelaya.php">dropped proceedings against Brazil</a> [JURIST report] brought by the Honduran interim government last October in response to the sheltering of Zelaya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The company chartered a ship, the Probo Koala, to deliver and unload acidic and corrosive fuel refining waste in the Netherlands, but had it pumped back onto the ship due to processing costs. The company then agreed to pay an Ivory Coast contractor to dispose of the waste in 17 sites in the city of Abidjan.  Prosecutors alleged the waste was responsible for widespread illness in Abidjan, including 15 deaths. The company was acquitted of forgery charges for concealing the nature of the chemical waste before the ship arrived in the Netherlands. Laywers for the company believe Judge Frans Bauduin <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/23/amsterdam-court-fines-oil-trader-trafigura-million-role-hazardous-waste-case/">applied the incorrect treaty</a> [AP report] in finding that exporting the waste to Ivory Coast was illegal, arguing that the <a href="http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?doc_id=678&topic_id=258">Marine Pollution Treaty</a> [MARPOL 73/78 text] applied, under which such exportation was legal. Trafigura <a href="http://www.trafigura.com/our_news/probo_koala_updates.aspx#zlZq9HD4l0g6">issued a statement</a> [press release] regarding the judgment on its website:<blockquote>While Trafigura is pleased to have been acquitted of the charge of forgery it is disappointed by the judges' ruling on the other two [charges], which it believes to be incorrect.  The court has decided that different technical legislation is applicable than that claimed by Tranfigura in its defence.  Concerning the delivery of dangerous goods, it is important that the court has noted that there was limited risk to human health from these slops, and indeed no damage occurred in Amsterdam.  Trafigura will study the court's findings carefully with a view to appeal.</blockquote>Trafigura paid 152 million euros (USD $196.4 million) to Ivory Coast in 2007 to assist with clean-up efforts and settled a civil suit filed in the UK last year by agreeing to compensate 30,000 Abidjan residents made ill by the waste a total of $1,500 each. The Amsterdam court also found the captain of the Probo Koala guilty of co-delivering the hazardous waste and forgery related to concealing its nature. He was sentenced to a five-month suspended prison term. Trafigura employee Naeem Ahmed was also found guilty of leading the harmful delivery and was sentenced to a 6-month suspended sentence and a fine of 25,000 euros (USD $32,300). Both the city of Amsterdam and Amsterdam Port Services were discharged from prosecution in the matter.

<p>Trafigura is the latest oil company to be under fire for questionable business dealings in Africa. Last month, Sweden's international prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sweden-prosecutor-to-probe-possible-oil-company-complicity-in-sudan-war-crimes.php">announced an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into <a href="http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/eng/index.php">Lundin Petroleum</a> [company website] for crimes against humanity committed in Sudan from 1997 to 2003. The prosecutor will investigate allegations that Sudanese troops attacked and displaced civilians so that Lundin could have access to the land for drilling, which exacerbated violence in the area and led to displacement and killing of civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment, added as subsection O, would remove language from the law allowing interdependent domestic partners to receive health benefits by changing the definition of "dependent" to include only married couples and their children, effective October 1, 2010. The state employees argue that the amendment violates their rights to equal protection and substantive due process and that the amendment has no rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.  In his order, Judge John Sedwick granted the preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs met their burden of showing that their case would be likely to succeed on the merits and that they would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. He also found the state's arguments that the amendment served the state interest of cost savings and administrative efficiency to be "speculative at best and discriminatory at worst." <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [official website], the organization representing the state workers, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/az_20100723_fed-judge-blocks.html">praised the judge's decision</a> [press release]:<blockquote>This injunction removes the sword that's been hanging over the heads of hundreds of state workers and their families. We're pleased Judge Sedwick has recognized that this is a matter of equal pay for equal work, and that eliminating benefits for Arizona's gay and lesbian state employees would hurt real families.</blockquote>The order also denied the state's motion to dismiss the workers' equal protection claim and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer's claim of immunity. The order granted the state's motion to dismiss the workers' substantive due process claim. The injunction is set to go into effect within 10 days.

<p>Arizona is also facing a federal lawsuit regarding its controversial new immigration law. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] arguing that the law violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The law criminalizes illegal immigration and allows police officers to question individuals based on "reasonable suspicion" that they are in the country illegally. The law is already being contested in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] led by the <a href="www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website]. Brewer signed the legislation into law in April and the law is set to go into effect on July 29.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief Justice Pierre Blais criticized the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/canada-court-orders-government-to-remedy-khadr-rights-breach.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report], which gave the Canadian government one week to come up with a list of measures to protect Khadr's rights and stated that the court would impose a remedy if the government failed to do so. In a ruling released Thursday, Blais stated that the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/appeal-court-ruling-clears-way-for-khadr-trial/article1650794/">lower court lacked the authority</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] to impose a remedy and that the court's decision interfered with the government's right to oversee and control matters regarding foreign affairs. Khadr's lawyers are uncertain whether they will pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court in light of the fact that Khadr's trial before a US military commission is <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-judge-sets-opening-date-for-khadr-trial.php">scheduled to begin on August 10</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] allowed Khadr to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-court-maintains-stay-on-khadr-habeas-petition.php">amend his 2004 <em>habeas corpus</em> petition</a> [JURIST report], but refused to lift the stay on the petition pending the conclusion of his trial before the military commission.  Earlier this month, a US judge ordered Khadr's military attorney to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-lawyer-to-offer-vigorous-defense.php">continue defending him</a> [JURIST report] after Khadr fired his civilian attorneys and requested that the military attorney be fired as well. At a pre-trial hearing at Guantanamo Bay, Khadr informed the US war crimes court that he had <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/khadr-tells-court-he-previously-rejected-plea-deal.php">previously rejected a plea deal</a> [JURIST report] offered by the US government to suspend all but five years of a 30-year prison sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. He stated that the plea would have been used to excuse the torture and abuse of a child. Khadr also indicated that he would not participate in the trial or offer a defense on his own behalf because the process offers him no hope of justice. Khadr is <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">facing murder and terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly throwing a grenade that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the Israeli government has not yet made an official announcement regarding its position, an unnamed senior Israeli official called the investigation <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-we-won-t-assist-obsessive-un-gaza-flotilla-probe-1.303840">unnecessary and obsessive</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report].

The official announcement regarding Israel's decision is expected to be made this week. While the government may not cooperate with the UNHRC probe, the official is expecting an announcement that the government will comply with a separate UN investigation created under the authority of <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontturkeyflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pPmCv.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish] on Saturday stated his willingness to consider changes to a law that allows the military to interfere in domestic matters. Article 35 of Turkish Armed Forces Services Law, which gives the military the authority to intervene in domestic affairs in certain situations, has been used in the past to justify military coups, including the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/tu-military-coup-1980.htm">1980 Turkish coup</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Opponents of Article 35 say the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66N18U20100724">law is authoritarian</a> [Reuters report] and warn that it could be used to justify future coups within the country, while supports contend that the law allows the military to fulfill its role as the protector of a secular government. Erdogan indicated he was willing to consider changing the law at a speech being held as part of a campaign to garner support for a nationwide referendum on a series of constitutional <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5982.html">amendments</a> [text, in Turkish] which is scheduled to be held in September. The proposed amendments were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/turkish-parliament-approves-constitutional-reforms.php">approved by the Turkish Grand National Assembly</a> in May, but a portion of the reforms aimed at limiting the power of the judiciary and bringing the judiciary and military under government control were <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/turkish-court-annuls-parts-of-constitutional-reforms.php">ruled unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports] by the Turkish Constitutional Court earlier this month. Supporters of the reforms, which include allowing civil courts to try military officers as well as expanded labor union rights and consumer protects, state that they are required for Turkey's admission to the EU. Opponents, however, contend the reforms are meant to consolidate power and to bring the traditionally secular judiciary and military under control of the government. Criticism of Erdogan's ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] has been growing, and many see Erdogan's support for the change in the law as a way to build broader support for the referendum vote. 

<p>Erdogan's promise to consider changes to the law came one day after a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/turkish-court-issues-102-arrest-warrants-for-alleged-coup-plot.php">ordered the arrest of 102 people</a> [JURIST report], including two serving and three retired military officers, in connection with an alleged 2003 coup plot. The <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/darbenin-adi-balyoz.htm">2003 Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [Taraf report, in Turkish; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">backgrounder</a>], or "Sledgehammer" plot, which included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane in order to undermine the government, was revealed by the <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/">Taraf</a> [media website] newspaper in January. The Istanbul <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/turkey.htm">10th Court for Serious Crimes</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] ordered the arrests after <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/turkish-court-indicts-196-in-connection-to-coup-plot.php">another court indicted 196</a> [JURIST report] over the plot on Monday. In June, the trial of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">33 retired and active naval officers</a> [JURIST report], accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule in another plot planned by a group called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>], began. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling AKP. The investigations into the alleged coups have strained relations between the religiously-inclined government and the secular military, which has been responsible for four coups in the last 50 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found Kaing guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating the 1949 Geneva Conventions, sentencing him to 35 years in prison. Prosecutors had sought a 40-year sentence, but the court reduced his sentence due to mitigating factors such as his cooperation with the trial, admission of responsibility, remorse and the potential for rehabilitation. Kaing also gets credit for time served, including a period of "illegal detention" by the Cambodian Military Court starting in 1999 and his period of detention during his ECCC trial. Kaing had also faced charges of premeditated murder and torture under domestic Cambodian law. Kaing was not convicted of these charges, however, because the judges were <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/637/20100726_Preliminary_Objection_Case_001_ENG_PUBLIC.pdf">unable to come to a majority</a> [judgment, PDF] on the charges, leaving the court unable to convict under the <a href="http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/CTM/Domestic_Cambodian_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf?phpMyAdmin=8319ad34ce0db941ff04d8c788f6365e&phpMyAdmin=ou7lpwtyV9avP1XmRZP6FzDQzg3&phpMyAdmin=KZTGHmT45FRCAiEg7OLlzXFdNJ4">ECCC law</a> [text, PDF]. Kaing was the head of the Tuol Sleng detention facility under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. The court found that, during this time, more than 12,000 people were killed due to mass executions and the conditions in the facility. 

<p>Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">unexpectedly asked to be released</a> [JURIST report] at the close of his trial in November. His request was a complete departure from his previous conduct, as he had cooperated with the trial and repeatedly apologized to his victims and their families. His lawyers took different approaches in their closing remarks, with one stating that his client was not guilty and the other asking for clemency. In March 2009, Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-duch-apologizes.php">accepted responsibility and apologized</a> [JURIST report] for his conduct at the detention facility. He is the first of eight ex-Khmer Rouge officials expected to be tried before the ECCC. In April, the pre-trial chamber of the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cambodia-genocide-court-denies-bail-for.php">dismissed appeals by three other former Khmer Rouge officials</a> [JURIST report] to block the extension of their provisional detention. The three prisoners, Ieng Thirith, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were arrested in November 2007 and face charges of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder, torture and religious persecution. The tre-trial chamber found in each case that "there is sufficient additional evidence in the case file to demonstrate that the case has progressed expeditiously" and that further detention while the investigation continues is reasonable given the "gravity and nature of the crimes" charged.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement comes after the release of the Afghan War Diaries on Sunday, which has been described as the largest unauthorized release of classified documents in US military history. Assange <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/wikileaks-more-us-documents-578268.html">cited thousands of US strikes in Afghanistan</a> [AP report], including a 2007 raid on a compound believed to house a senior <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader, which resulted in the death of seven children and the cover-up of civilian casualties as examples of possible war crimes. The leaked documents reportedly suggest that Pakistani government officials have met with members of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and reveal the extent of civilian casualties due to US air strikes and the frustration of the US government with Pakistani leadership for its ties to Afghan militants. Assange has stated that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10758578">Wikileaks has thousands more documents</a> [BBC report] that it will be releasing in the future under the direction of the source. In responding to the leak, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/nsa/">National Security Advisor James Jones</a> [official profile] emphasized that the period covered by the documents, January 2004 to December 2009, was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/statement-national-security-advisor-general-james-jones-wikileaks">before the comprehensive review</a> [press release] of US war strategy conducted by the Obama administration in fall 2009. He went on to highlight the strong relationship between the US and Pakistan. 

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">US Army formally charged</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/">Pfc. Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website] for leaking a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzYTxuW2vmzk">controversial classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq and classified State Department documents. Manning <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/2010/Manning-charge-sheet.pdf">faces two charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF] under the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text] for the transfer of classified information and exceeding his authorized computer access. Manning was detained in Kuwait in May after releasing the video, entitled "Collateral Murder," on Wikileaks. Wikileaks does not ask sources to identify themselves, but Manning was reported to authorities by former hacker Andrian Lamo, who learned of the leaks after forming an online friendship with the soldier. Due to the gravity of the charges, Manning's investigation could lead to a court-martial. In May 2009, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on the US government to make <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/rights-group-urges-us-to-respect-laws.php">"fundamental changes to reduce civilian casualties"</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan after attacks last week reportedly left more than 140 civilians dead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICT was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in March</a> [JURIST report] to try those accused of committing war crimes during the 1971 war, in which Bangladeshi forces succeeded in gaining independence from Pakistan. The warrants, <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=168996&cid=2">announced by Chief Justice Nizamul Haque</a> [bdnews24 report] at the tribunal's first hearing, lay charges of genocide, murder and torture on JI head Motiur Rahman Nizami, Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and senior assistant secretaries general Muhammad Qamaruzzaman and Abdul Quader Mollah. A fifth JI leader, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, is expected to be charged with war crimes as well. JI has alleged that the government is using the ICT to reign in the activities of opposition parties. The suspects are <a href="http://arabnews.com/world/article90219.ece">charged with killing 345 people</a> [Reuters report] during the war, in which JI is suspected of supporting Pakistani forces. The four are already in custody for separate charges or murder and sedition. The warrants were issued at the request of prosecutors to make sure the suspects remain in custody during the investigation. The suspects will not have the opportunity to seek bail. The next hearing in the case is set for early August. 

<p>In March, Bangladeshi officials announced the establishment of the tribunal, fulfilling a campaign promise of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [BBC profile]. The tribunal includes three high court judges and six investigators retired from civilian, law enforcement and military careers. The trials investigating the 1971 war crimes will take place under the recently amended <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973</a> [text, PDF]. Officials estimate that Pakistani soldiers and local militia participated in more than three million killings and 200,000 rapes. The announcement of the tribunal came the same week as the Bangladesh Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-cabinet-ratifies-icc-treaty.php">ratified the Rome Statute</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icc.php">news archive</a>]. Although the ratification will not directly affect Bangladesh's pending war crimes trials for the 1971 Liberation War because the ICC can only hear cases arising since its formation in 2002, it will require the country to update its laws to reflect provisions of the statute. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Paul Friedman granted the petition after finding that the Obama administration did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Almerfedi, who has been in US custody since 2002, was either part of or substantially supporting the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> or <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders], under the standard set by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official wesbite; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [JURIST report]. The government argued that it had met this standard because Almerfedi had stayed at an al Qaeda guest house, had been a facilitator for al Qaeda's activities and was affiliated with <a href="http://www.southasiaanalysis.org//papers20/paper1943.html">Jama'at al Tablighi</a> (JT) [SAAG backgrounder], an Islamic missionary organization that the government alleges to have ties with al Qaeda. Almerfedi argued that he did not have ties with al Qaeda and was only involved with JT in hopes that the organization would send him to Europe for missionary work, where he hoped to relocate. In rejecting the government's arguments, Friedman cited the unreliability of the evidence against him, a significant portion of which was based entirely on the testimony of a fellow Guantanamo detainee. Due to this, the charges that he had stayed at the guest house and had acted as a facilitator were not accepted by the court. Additionally, Friedman held that despite evidence that some members of JT contributed financially to al Qaeda, this did not meet the burden of evidence in showing that Almerfedi provided support to the organization. Also Friday, the district court <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1235-135">denied the <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1235-134">order</a>, PDF] of <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/321-ahmed-yaslam-said-kuman">Ahmed Yaslam Said Kuman</a> [NYT profile]. In doing so, Judge John Bates found that the attorney's filing the petition on Kuman's behalf did not have his authorization to do so, as required in Guantanamo <em>habeas</em> petitions. Additionally, Bates held that Kuman's decision not to proceed was knowing and voluntary. 

<p>The recent decisions bring the successful number of Guantanamo <em>habeas</em> petitions to 38, with the government winning 16. The district court on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo-detainees-habeas-petition.php">granted the <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [JURIST report] of another Yemeni detainee, <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/156-allal-ab-aljallil-abd-al-rahman/documents/8/pages/879#36">Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif</a> [NYT profile], ordering his immediate release from Guantanamo. In a separate decision announced Wednesday, a federal judge denied the <em>habeas</em> petition of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/223-abdul-rahman-abdul-abu-ghityh-sulayman">Abdul-Rahman Sulayman</a> [NYT profile], ruling that he can continue to be held in custody indefinitely. Sulayman has also been in custody for over eight years. Most of the nearly 200 detainees remaining at Guantanamo are Yemeni, and many detainees have been transferred back to Yemen. In January, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">US government suspended transfers</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo detainees to Yemen after it was revealed that the so-called "Christmas Day Bomber" <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8431530.stm">Umar Farouk Adbulmutallab</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>], received al Qaeda training in Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontimmigration.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] on Monday called on the US government to provide greater protection for those with mental disabilities in the US immigration system. In a joint report, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/usdeportation0710_0.pdf">"Deportation by Default"</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/human-rights/20th-anniversary-ada-aclu-and-hrw-release-report-treatment-people-mental-disabilities-i">press release</a>], the rights organizations criticized the US immigration system, which they claim often disadvantages those with mental disabilities who cannot understand the proceedings against them or adequately defend themselves. The report, which defines mental disability to include those with mental health problems and intellectual disabilities, finds that the lack of procedural safeguards, such as the right to appointed counsel, inflexible detention policies and the lack of guidance for judges or attorneys on how to ensure a fair hearing for people with mental disabilities creates a situation that violates both US and international standards for justice and due process. The rights groups estimate that as many as 15 percent of people facing deportation proceedings suffer from mental disabilities. These failures, according to the rights organizations, impair the due process and judicial integrity. The report explains:<blockquote>Due process is part of judicial integrity. It's a basic principle that this country has decided to prioritize. It's one of our greatest exports&#8212;we send people all over the world to talk about rule of law and how to reform judicial systems but we're not doing it here in our fastest growing judicial system[, the immigration courts]. Not every non-citizen with a mental disability is entitled to remain in the United States; but everyone is entitled to a fair hearing and a chance to defend his or her rights. If the US government is going to detain and deport individuals with mental disabilities, it must do so in a way that respects their human rights, honors US human rights commitments, and ensures fair and accurate court decisions.</blockquote>The report went on urge the US government to take steps to ensure the rights of all people in the immigration system are upheld. These recommendations include calling on Congress to provide for appointed counsel in immigration proceedings and amend the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [text] to exempt from vulnerable groups from mandatory detention and deportation and for the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] to put in place regulations to protect vulnerable non-citizens.

<p>Last week, a Syracuse University research center study indicated that backlogs at US immigration courts are <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-immigration-caseloads-spike-amid-government-crackdown.php">up by more than 30 percent</a> [JURIST report] in the past 18 months. As of January 2009, there were an estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the US, one million less than 2007, according to the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website]. In the same period, deportations have more than doubled, peaking at 387,790 last year. Federal authorities have indicated that the workload would continue to grow if Arizona's new <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] is implemented. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. The constitutionality of the law has been widely disputed, and the legislation is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">now facing several lawsuits</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">called for comprehensive immigration reform</a> [JURIST report], noting the role of immigrants throughout US history and indicating that immigrants must continue to play a role as the country grows and develops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 11 men were apprehended in the Indian Ocean <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10763605">following the attempted hijacking</a> [BBC report] of a Seychelles coastguard ship in December. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hVDT4FlA1YSp28sv3lj1bQ3kSI5Q">trial began in March</a> [AFP report], after Seychelles amended its criminal code to allow <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder] in piracy cases. Eight of the men were convicted of piracy, and three others of aiding and abetting piracy. An additional <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/26/AR2010072602338.html">29 Somalis are being held</a> [AP report] by the Seychelles government for piracy awaiting either trial or deportation to Somalia. Also on Monday, Seychelles <a href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/">President James Michel</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=298:right-choice-seychelles-proactive-in-fight-against-piracy&catid=36:the-press-room&Itemid=64">lauded the actions of his government</a> [press release] as a leader on the issue of piracy, creating greater international awareness of the problem. In May, the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [office website] announced that the island nation of Seychelles will <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/seychelles-announces-creation-of-un-backed-piracy-court.php">create a UN-supported center</a> [JURIST report] to prosecute suspected pirates. The center will accept and try pirates captured by the <a href="http://www.eunavfor.eu/">European Union Naval Force Somalia</a> (EU NAVFOR) [official website] off the coast of Somalia and surrounding areas. This will be the second such court established for the prosecution of pirates, following only Kenya. Seychelles has received international support for its actions against piracy through the joint UN, EU <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/easternafrica//piracy/UNODC_Counter_Piracy_Programme.pdf">Counter-Piracy Program</a> [text, PDF]. The program has also assisted the country in preparing to hold piracy trials. 

<p>In June, UNODC announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">opening of a new high-security courtroom in Kenya</a> [JURIST report] that will hear maritime piracy cases as well as cases involving other serious criminal offenses. The courtroom was funded through contributions the UNODC received from donor states including Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the EU and the US. UNODC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">announced a week prior</a> [JURIST report] that donor states will spend more than USD $9.3 million to fund courts in Kenya and Seychelles that prosecute suspected Somali pirates. The Kenyan government announced in April that <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">it would no longer accept</a> [JURIST report] Somali pirate cases due to its overburdened legal system and the lack of support that had been promised by the international community. Kenya resumed the adjudication of piracy cases in May after being reassured it would receive additional support. Kenya currently has 123 suspected pirates awaiting trial, the highest number of any country that has agreed to hear piracy cases. Kenyan courts have convicted and sentenced 18 pirates since agreeing to assist in the prosecution of piracy cases. The governments of Mauritania and Tanzania have also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">expressed their willingness to try suspected pirates</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group argues that the UK government is in violation of UN resolutions <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.undemocracy.com%2FS-RES-1857(2008).pdf&ei=L-JOTJPVF5WCnQees6GXBw&usg=AFQjCNG_cKl_dKpkpLMLiGmR-0i0gbfAjg">1857</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CCAQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitycouncilreport.org%2Fatf%2Fcf%2F%257B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%257D%2FDRC%2520S%2520RES%25201896.pdf&ei=muJOTN78IcfanAf06tDPBw&usg=AFQjCNE3aM4ynPGXaOPmyPCKek0LlXZ-sg">1896</a> [texts, PDF], passed in 2008 and 2009, respectively, which require countries to report any companies involved in trading DRC minerals, believed to have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/20/AR2010072006212.html">played a large role in ongoing violence</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] in the African nation. GW cites violations listed in the <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&shortid=EGUA-7YHV4X&file=Full_Report.pdf">2009 UN Group of Experts report</a> [text, PDF] to support the legal complaint. The government denies the allegations, stating that the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">UK Foreign Office</a> [official website] has effectively monitored the mineral trade behavior of UK corporations. GW aims to obtain a mandatory court order requiring the coalition government to investigate the conduct of the government office and to ensure compliance with the UN sanctions. 

<p>Last week, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04173:">Restoring Financial Stability Act</a> [HR 4173 materials] into law. The legislation, which focuses on increasing regulation in the financial sector, included a provision requiring US companies producing electronic equipment like cell phones and laptops, to divulge what steps are being taken to ensure their products do not contain "conflict minerals" from the DRC. Last year, GW published a report claiming that international corporations that purchase minerals from the DRC are responsible for <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/dr-congo-conflict-prolonged-by.php">prolonging the conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the African country. The report was critical of several specific corporations, including <a href="http://www.amcgroup.com/">Amalgamated Metal Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.afrimex.be/defaultE.asp">Afrimex</a> and <a href="http://www.traxys.com/Gui/Content.aspx?Page=Home">Traxys</a> [corporate websites], for "turning a blind-eye" to the source of minerals they purchase and then sell to manufacturers. In the war-torn country, the Congolese military and numerous militia groups control mines responsible for production of gold and wolframite, and the report alleges that the unregulated market <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8159977.stm">brings significant profit to these groups</a> [BBC report], fueling the conflict. The current conflict in the DRC has been one of the most deadly in the world, claiming an estimated <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/23/congo.international">45,000</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] lives per month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kaing's lawyer <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jgYjBammvxbOIomw4rmiPw3FAubg">informed the court of the appeal</a> [AFP report] shortly after Monday's verdict, without stating the grounds for the appeal. The ECCC found Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">guilty of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] and of violating the 1949 Geneva Conventions, sentencing him to 35 years in prison. Kaing is expected to serve only 19 years due to credit for time served, including a period of "illegal detention" by the Cambodian Military Court starting in 1999 and his period of detention during his ECCC trial. Prosecutors had sought a 40-year sentence, but the court reduced his sentence due to mitigating factors such as his cooperation with the trial, admission of responsibility, remorse and the potential for rehabilitation. Kaing had also faced charges of premeditated murder and torture under domestic Cambodian law. Kaing was not convicted of these charges, however, because the judges were <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/637/20100726_Preliminary_Objection_Case_001_ENG_PUBLIC.pdf">unable to come to a majority</a> [judgment, PDF] on the charges, leaving the court unable to convict under the <a href="http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/CTM/Domestic_Cambodian_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf?phpMyAdmin=8319ad34ce0db941ff04d8c788f6365e&phpMyAdmin=ou7lpwtyV9avP1XmRZP6FzDQzg3&phpMyAdmin=KZTGHmT45FRCAiEg7OLlzXFdNJ4">ECCC law</a> [text, PDF]. Kaing was the head of the Tuol Sleng detention facility under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979. The court found that, during this time, more than 12,000 people were killed due to mass executions and the conditions in the facility.

<p>Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">unexpectedly asked to be released</a> [JURIST report] at the close of his trial in November. His request was a complete departure from his previous conduct, as he had cooperated with the trial and repeatedly apologized to his victims and their families. His lawyers took different approaches in their closing remarks, with one stating that his client was not guilty and the other asking for clemency. In March 2009, Kaing <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-duch-apologizes.php">accepted responsibility and apologized</a> [JURIST report] for his conduct at the detention facility. He is the first of eight ex-Khmer Rouge officials expected to be tried before the ECCC. In April, the pre-trial chamber of the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cambodia-genocide-court-denies-bail-for.php">dismissed appeals by three other former Khmer Rouge officials</a> [JURIST report] to block the extension of their provisional detention. The three prisoners, Ieng Thirith, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were arrested in November 2007 and face charges of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder, torture and religious persecution. The tre-trial chamber found in each case that "there is sufficient additional evidence in the case file to demonstrate that the case has progressed expeditiously" and that further detention while the investigation continues is reasonable given the "gravity and nature of the crimes" charged.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/same-sex-couples-sue-in-new-jersey-for.php">lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] in March, arguing that the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/A4000/3787_I1.PDF">Civil Unions Law</a> [text, PDF] does not adhere to the 2006 ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2912577675644260481">Lewis v. Harris</a> [decision; Lambda Legal <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/lewis-v-harris.html">backgrounder</a>], which said that same-sex couples should have "full rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual married couples." The plaintiffs claim that they face discrimination as couples in civil unions compared to opposite-sex married couples. The court divided evenly 3-3 on whether the hear the case, falling short of the four-justice majority required to hear it. The court cited a lack of a trial record in the decision, which it said was necessary to assess the case on its merits. The three dissenting justices argued that the court should not have dismissed the case without a hearing because if the plaintiffs' allegations of discrimination are true they should not face unnecessary delay. <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website], an organization representing one of the plaintiffs, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/nj_20100726_supreme-court-denies-lewis.html">expressed disappointment with the ruling</a> [press release], stating:<blockquote>We are terribly disappointed about today's ruling. Our plaintiffs and the New Jersey legislature's own Civil Union Review Commission documented the rampant discrimination same-sex couples face as a consequence of civil union status, and this ruling now relegates our plaintiffs to second-class citizenship for even longer. ... Separating out one group and relegating the people in it to a lesser status, in this case to civil unions in New Jersey, invites discrimination from all quarters&#8212;the government, businesses, schools, medical providers, individuals.</blockquote>The case was dismissed without prejudice, and is expected to be brought in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/superior/index.htm">New Jersey Superior Court</a> [offiicial website].

<p>The New Jersey couples filed the lawsuit seeking to legalize <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Supreme Court claiming that they "and other committed lesbian gay partners in New Jersey live in second-class circumstances, relegated to demonstrably inferior, state-created status of civil unions." They argued that same-sex couples lack workplace benefits and protections, face unequal treatment and lack of recognition in public accommodations and civic life, and that their children are "prejudiced by the unequal and inferior legal and social status" of civil unions. New Jersey has <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-jersey-civil-unions-bill-signed.php">recognized same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST report] since 2006. In January, the New Jersey Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">voted 20-14 to defeat a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have legalized same-sex marriage in the state.

The charges come after a period of detention by the Algerian government under a statute that allows for the detention of terror suspects for up to 12 days. Naji was released Sunday after a judge <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE66P0HY20100726">placed him under judicial supervision</a> [Reuters report], requiring him to appear at the local police station every week. Naji, who was held at Guantanamo since his capture in 2002, was repatriated to Algeria earlier this month after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/supreme-court-permits-guantanamo-detainees-return-to-algeria.php">failed to stay the transfer</a> [JURIST report]. Naji had appealed to the court asking that it review his pending transfer and that he be allowed to remain at the Guantanamo facility. In his appeal, Naji <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/19/AR2010071904922.html">expressed concern that he would be tortured or killed</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] if returned to Algeria. The Obama administration had indicated it had received assurances from the Algerian government that Naji would not be mistreated after returning to the country, citing the Algerians who have been returned to the country from Guantanamo Bay without incident as proof that Naji would be safe in the country.

<p>In February, an <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/algeria-court-acquits-former-guantanamo.php">Algerian criminal court acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Guantanamo detainee Mustafa Hemlili of charges of counterfeiting and affiliation to a militant group that is active abroad. Hemlili was released from Guantanamo, along with fellow inmate Hederbash Sufian, after a six-year detention period. July's transfers brought the total number of Guantanamo detainees transferred to Algeria to over 20. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced in January that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">two detainees had been transferred to Algeria</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/533-hassan-zumiri">Hassan Zumiri</a> had spent more than seven years in the Guantanamo detention center, while <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/1452-adil-hadi-al-jazairi-bin-hamlili">Adil Hadi al-Jazairi bin Hamlili</a> [NYT profiles] had been held for five.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontillegalimmigrants.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Mounting emphasis on enforcement of existing immigration laws under the Obama administration has seen a sharp rise in deportations by US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website], according to a <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/25/AR2010072501790.html">report</a> [text] Monday. The new emphasis on enforcement was outlined in a June <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/civil_enforcement_priorities.pdf">memo</a> [text, PDF] from ICE <a href="http://www.ice.gov/about/leadership/asstsec_bio/john_morton.htm">Assistant Secretary John Morton</a> [official profile]. ICE expects to have the resources to deport 400,000 illegal immigrants this year, a 10 percent increase over last year's total. Additionally, raids on corporations suspected of employing illegal immigrants have seen a fourfold increase over the Bush administration, and law enforcement officers have made the deportation of convicted felons and federal offenders their primary focus, according to the memo. Resources should be focused on illegal immigrants that endanger national security, who have been convicted of crimes or otherwise endanger public safety, the memo emphasized. Critics of the Obama administration have decried the latter policy as facilitating arbitrarily uneven enforcement of the law. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-calls-for-comprehensive-immigration-reform.php">called for comprehensive immigration reform</a> [JURIST report], noting the role of immigrants throughout US history and indicating that immigrants must continue to play a role as the country grows and develops.

<p>Last week, a Syracuse University study indicated that backlogs at US immigration courts are <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-immigration-caseloads-spike-amid-government-crackdown.php">up by more than 30 percent</a> [JURIST report] in the past 18 months. As of January 2009, there were an estimated 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the US, one million less than in 2007, according to the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website]. In that same period, deportations have more than doubled, peaking at 387,790 last year.

A <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/HMCSCourtFinder/Search.do?court_id=295">City of Westminster Magistrates' Court</a> [official website] judge blocked the bid, saying that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jga1zfm2U7osTNe3RH5KcBjXdEOg">extradition request was politically motivated</a> [AFP report] and an abuse of the processes of the court.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/former-bosnia-president-faces-extradition-from-the-uk.php">extradition hearing</a> took place earlier this month following Ganic's <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-police-arrest-former-bosnian-vp.php">arrest by British police</a> [JURIST reports] at Heathrow Airport in March pursuant to a Serbian provisional extradition warrant. Ganic is the highest ranking official among 19 for whom Serbia has issued an arrest warrant in connection with the Dobrovoljacka Street incident at the onset of the Bosnian conflict. Bosnian authorities dismiss Serbian claims surrounding the incident on the grounds that they were defending their own territory and that Serbia is undermining procedures in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Krajisnik was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTY in 2006 to 27 years in a British prison for his role in the forced evacuation and displacement of several thousand Muslims and Croatians, including women and children, during the Bosnian war in 1992. Though British law dictates that Krajisnik should have been eligible for parole on April 2, ICTY President Patrick Robinson said his decision to deny early release was largely based on the severity of Krajisnik's crimes and the tribunal's treatment of similar convicts:<blockquote>While Mr. KrajiSnik has displayed some evidence of rehabilitation, I am of the view that there remain significant factors that weigh against granting him early release. Mr. Krajisnik's crimes are of a very high gravity, involving a widespread displacement of the non-Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which caused great suffering. Moreover, in respect of the requirement that the  President shall take into account the treatment of similarly-situated prisoners, the practice of the Tribunal is to consider the eligibility of a convicted person only after he has served two-thirds of his sentence; therefore,  the fact that Mr. Krajisnik has only recently completed serving half of his sentence does not weigh in favour of his early release.</blockquote>The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-bosnia-serb-leader-transferred.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] Krajisnik's sentence to 20 years in September 2009, transferring him to a UK prison to serve his time. 

<p>At his 2006 trial, the ICTY found Krajisnik not guilty on a charge of genocide for which prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/icty-prosecutors-seek-life-sentence.php">requested a life sentence</a> [JURIST report]. Krajisnik was initially indicted together with <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/plavsic/4">Biljana Plavsic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=plavsic">news archive</a>], the former Bosnian Serb president who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003 after testifying against Krajisnik.

The declaration comes a week after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] ruled that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence did <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icj-rules-kosovo-independence-declaration-did-not-violate-international-law.php">not violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. The resolution was passed during the National Assembly's <a href="http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/aktivnosti/skupstinske_detalji.asp?Id=2110&t=A">Sixth Extraordinary Session</a> [activity report] after 12 hours of debate and stressed the need to maintain Serbian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Additionally, the resolution called for a peaceful resolution to the dispute, which is in line with the <a href="http://www.srbija.gov.rs/cinjenice_o_srbiji/ustav.php?change_lang=en">Serbian Constitution</a> [text], which expressly prohibits any action to change Serbia's borders. Also during the parliamentary debate, opposition lawmakers criticized the government for subjecting Serbia to international humiliation. In explaining the resolution, the Serbian government stated:<blockquote>The Parliament considers that peaceful negotiation should result in a permanent, sustainable and mutually acceptable solution for Kosovo-Metohija, in accordance with the Constitution of Serbia, allowing for a historical reconciliation of the Serbian and Albanian people, as well as peace and stability in the region. The document calls for national unity and the use of all available diplomatic and political means to preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. The Parliament expresses its full commitment to achieving national and political unity regarding the preservation of Kosovo-Metohija, and confirms that the Republic of Serbia will never, either explicitly or implicitly, recognise the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo-Metohija.</blockquote>The government went on to state that it considered all actions of the Kosovo government from the independence declaration onwards to be void and promised to bring the question of Kosovo's independence before the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] when its session opens in September.

<p>The ICJ issued a non-binding ruling Thursday that Kosovo's 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">declaration of independence from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] did not violate international law. Serbia had argued that <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/press/reports/N9917289.pdf">UN Resolution 1244</a> [text, PDF], which ended the war in Kosovo, solidified the country's boundaries, which included the southern region of Kosovo. Kosovo argued that the resolution was not meant to exclude the opportunity for secession. The opinion of the court stated that nothing in international law prohibited a unilateral declaration of independence. The ruling could have far-reaching implications for other countries with territories seeking recognition as independent states. Serbia's position was backed by a majority of UN countries, including Russia, China and Spain, but Kosovo has consistently been supported by the US and most European countries. Serbian <a href="http://www.predsednik.rs/mwc/default.asp?c=101000&g=20060904141200&lng=eng&hs1=0">President Boris Tadic</a> [official profile] maintained that <a href="http://www.predsednik.rs/mwc/default.asp?c=303000&g=20100722191249&lng=cir&hs1=0">Serbia will not recognize</a> [statement, in Serbian] Kosovo's independence, claiming the ICJ ruling was limited only to the question of whether the declaration itself violated international law, and not whether the secession was legal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group leader, 22-year-old Dmitry Orlov, was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jjeFXSbcckfNS807NCzDqmxXSL0QD9H7EG181">sentenced to life imprisonment</a> [AP report] for planning hate crimes as part of Russian National Unity (RNU), a fundamentalist organization promoting white supremacy and anti-Muslim and Jewish teachings.

The other group members received jail terms of up to 17 years. 

<p>Russian courts have recently taken action against neo-Nazi groups in the country.

The SEC claimed that, between 2000 and 2003, four of GE's subsidiaries gave millions of dollars worth of computer equipment, medical supplies and services to the Iraqi Health Ministry in exchange for contract deals. The complaint described the impact of GE's actions:<blockquote>The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief to the Iraqi population, then subject to comprehensive international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase necessary humanitarian goods, but required that all purchases be made through a UN-controlled escrow account. The kickbacks paid in connection with all four subsidiaries' Oil for Food contracts had the effect of diverting funds out of the escrow account and...into an Iraqi slush fund.</blockquote>The SEC complaint argued that GE's kickbacks were in violation of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> (SEA) [text, PDF] and called for GE to pay back all illegal profits with interest, as well as civil penalties. GE claimed that most of the disputed contracts occurred before the corporation gained ownership of the subsidiaries and that four of the contracts were improperly recorded. The US government will <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/general-electric-to-pay-234m-over-oilforfood-corruption-charges-2036891.html">not take further action against GE</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] after the settlement.

<p>Several companies and individuals have been accused of participating in the Iraq oil-for-food scandal. In April, a Paris judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-oil-company-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] French oil company <a href="http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html">Total</a> [corporate website] with bribery and complicity in connection with the scandal. According to the 2005 Volcker report, published by a UN-appointed <a href="http://iic-offp.org/index.html">Independent Inquiry Committee</a> [official website] investigating corruption in the oil-for-food program, oil companies like Total allegedly paid Iraqi officials <a href="http://iic-offp.org/story27oct05.htm">over $1.5 billion in illegal kickbacks</a> [materials] in exchange for being selected as oil purchasers. Over the last three years, oil company <a href="http://www.chevron.com/">Chevron</a> [corporate website] also <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chevron-settles-sec-charges-in-oil-for.php">paid a large settlement</a> to the SEC concerning misuse of the program, and two Texan oil barons, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/texas-oil-company-owner-sentenced-to.php">David Chalmers</a> and  <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/texas-oil-tycoon-sentenced-to-year-in.php">Oscar Wyatt Jr.</a> [JURIST reports], were sentenced to prison for their roles in the scandal. The oil-for-food program allowed the Iraqi government of <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], under UN sanctions in the wake of the first Gulf War, to sell limited stocks of oil in return for foodstuffs and other humanitarian supplies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00220">57-41</a> [roll call vote] fell short of the supermajority required to overcome a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Filibuster_Cloture.htm">filibuster</a> [Senate backgrounder], and reportedly makes <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/40311.html">passage before the November elections unlikely</a> [POLITICO report], despite statements to the contrary by supporters. Supporters argue that the legislation is a necessary response to the January US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [JURIST report], which eased restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations. If signed into law, the bill would prohibit corporations receiving federal contracts worth more than $7 million from spending money on "electioneering communications" and would also prohibit foreign-controlled domestic corporations from financing campaigns. The legislation was unanimously opposed by Senate Republicans, who have criticized the bill as an attempt by Democrats to influence the coming election in their favor. In leading the Senate Republicans in opposition to the bill, Senate <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/">Minority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) [official website] criticized the legislation, contrasting it with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which he said "made [sure] that everybody would have to play by the same rules." Unlike the current legislation which he said:<blockquote>[I]s not an effort to promote transparency. It is not a response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United. ... This bill is a partisan effort, pure and simple, drafted behind closed doors by current and former Democrat campaign committee leaders, ... aimed at ... protecting incumbent Democrats from criticism ahead of November. The supporters of this bill say it's about transparency. To that, I say it's transparent alright. It's a transparent effort to rig the fall elections. And they're so intent on their goal that they're willing to launch an all-out assault on the First Amendment in order to get there.</blockquote>On Monday, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-disclose-act">came out in favor of the bill</a> [statement], stating that a 'no' vote on the legislation would damage democracy and "allow corporate and special interest takeovers of our elections."

<p>Last week, <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Senator Charles Schumer</a> (D-NY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/democratic-senator-introduces-amended-campaign-finance-legislation.php">introduced an amended version of the campaign finance bill</a> [JURIST report] in order to gain support from moderate Republicans in the hope of increasing the chance of the bill's passage. The new version of the bill removed several provisions included in the version <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-approves-campaign-finance-reform-legislation.php">passed by the House of Representatives</a> [JURIST report] last month, including exemptions in the bill that may benefit unions over corporations and requiring organizations funding political advertising in states where they do not do business to disclose the location of the organization. Senate Democrats first <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to.php">introduced their version of the Disclose Act</a> [JURIST report] in April after the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">held hearings</a> [JURIST report] in March on the effects of the Citizens United decision. In Citizens United, the court struck down &#167; 203 of the BCRA, which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an "electioneering communication" or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ordinance would require all employers in the city to register for the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify program</a> [DHS website] and would make it a crime to rent to illegal immigrants. It would also void any lease entered into by an illegal immigrant and would require every person seeking to rent residential property to obtain an occupancy permit from the city, which would require the applicant to sign a declaration affirming his or her US citizenship or otherwise provide a visa or employment authorization number. The suspension of the ordinance, which was to go into effect Thursday, was <a href="http://www.omaha.com/article/20100727/NEWS01/100729713/1009">taken in light of a pending injunction</a> [<em>Omaha World-Herald</em> report] against the ordinance and as a cost saving measure, according to council members, who have stated that enforcing the law would cost the city $200,000 annually and defending it would cost the city up to $1 million per year. The vote occurred without debate, and the council also voted to hire <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/kobach.htm">Kris Kobach</a> [academic profile] to <a href="http://www.kptm.com/Global/story.asp?S=12881054">defend the city</a> [KPTM report] against the lawsuits. Kobach, a law professor and political candidate in Kansas, assisted in the drafting of the ordinance and the Arizona <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] and offered his assistance to Fremont <em>pro bono</em>.  A previous version of the ordinance was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/us_and_canada/10364664.stm">narrowly voted down</a> [BBC report] by the city council in 2008.

<p>Two <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-groups-file-suits-against-nebraska-city-immigration-law.php">lawsuits</a> were filed last week seeking injunctive relief against the ordinance, which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php">passed by city voters in a referendum</a> [JURIST reports] last month. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] filed their lawsuits in the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website]. In its <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-7-21-MartinezvFremont-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], the ACLU challenged the law based on the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clauses of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text]. MALDEF's <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/fremonttribune.com/content/tncms/assets/editorial/8/5e/275/85e275f4-94e4-11df-8ca0-001cc4c03286-revisions/4c471f68d1d5c.pdf.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] makes nearly identical arguments, adding that the ordinance interferes with a person's right to enter into and enforce contracts under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001981----000-.html">federal law</a> [42 USC &#167; 1981 text] and violates Article 11 of the <a href="http://www.neded.org/files/research/stathand/parttwo/nebconst.html">Nebraska Constitution</a> [text] because the Fremont municipal government has not been empowered by the <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/">Nebraska Legislature</a> [official website] to enforce immigration law. Additionally, MALDEF cites five cases of similar local laws that were struck down by federal and state courts, including a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-texas-city.php">nearly identical law struck down</a> [JURIST report] by a federal district court in Texas. The ACLU is also <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenging the Arizona immigration law</a> [JURIST report] on similar grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/2010-07/26/c_12373078.htm">order</a> [Xinhua report, in Chinese] stems from public response to an <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2010-07/18/c_12345432.htm">incident</a> [Xinhua report, in Chinese] earlier this month when officers in the southern city of Dongguan paraded roped and handcuffed suspected prostitutes down a city street in the middle of the day, posting pictures of the event on the internet. Many Internet posters, increasingly leery of <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">corruption in Chinese law enforcement</a> [JURIST news archive], expressed outrage at the police use of public shaming. Though public shaming has been a long-held Chinese law enforcement practice, instances of it have been on the rise in recent months after the country initiated an anti-vice crackdown earlier this year. Police officials have said that the posting of the inflammatory images on the internet was <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2010-07/28/c_12383201.htm">accidental</a> [Xinhua report, in Chinese].

<p>Chinese law enforcement practices have fallen under fire in recent months as police have been accused of brutality and corruption. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-urges-china-to-investigate-xinjiang-riots.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to launch an independent investigation into law enforcement conduct during the July 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=xinjiang+riot">Xinjiang riots</a> [JURIST news archive], accusing police of executing arbitrary arrests and employing excessive force. Last October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-officials-disappeared-uighurs.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that more than 40 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Uighurs">Uighur Muslims</a> [JURIST news archive] had disappeared while in the custody of Chinese authorities after large-scale police sweeps.  Residents of the region claim that the majority of the deaths were at the hands of Chinese authorities, but Chinese state media has reported that most of the deaths were due to protesters. The Chinese government has admitted that police were <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/china-official-says-police-killed-12-in.php">responsible for 12 of the deaths</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement came after <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100728x1.html">Chiba witnessed the execution</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report] of two convicts at the Tokyo Detention House. The review will examine the issue of capital punishment from all angles, according to Chiba, and will include members of the <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/index.html">Justice Ministry</a> [official website, in Japanese] in addition to experts who will be asked to participate. Critics have claimed Chiba, who opposes the death penalty, had political motivations in ordering the executions after losing her seat in elections earlier this month. Despite this, Chiba will remain justice minister until September. Responding to the announcement, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/japan-executions-two-men-condemned-2010-07-28">criticized Japanese use of the death penalty</a> [press release], stating:<blockquote>Japan continues to go against the international trend toward abolition and mete out this cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. A day that should have marked one year without executions has instead seen Japan return to carrying out state-sponsored killings. ... A working group to discuss the death penalty is not enough. There needs to be an open and public debate and an immediate moratorium on executions while the discussion takes place.</blockquote>In September, AI called on Japan to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/japan-urged-to-discontinue-executing.php">suspend use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] and ultimately abandon the practice due to the execution of mentally ill inmates and poor prison conditions. A February study conducted by the government found that capital punishment <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iWgHZyc-pUIRZddvcWUfQLrblVxw">enjoys support from 85 percent</a> [AFP report] of the Japanese public. 107 inmates are currently on death row in the country. 

<p>In recent years, Japan has experienced a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1377781.stm">sharp upswing in both violent crime</a> [BBC report] and the <a href="http://japanfocus.org/-Tom-Ellis/2340">perceived risk of violent crime</a> [Japan Focus study], factors used as justification for increasing the use of capital punishment. In January 2009, the Justice Ministry announced that <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/japan-executes-4-despite-pressure-to.php">four death row inmates were executed</a> [JURIST report], despite international pressure to end the practice. In 2008, the ministry carried out the execution of 15 prisoners, including <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/japan-executes-three-in-campaign-to.php">three inmates in June</a> [JURIST report], as well as an additional two in October. AI issued a statement <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/japan-executions-must-stop-says-amnesty-international-20080410">urging Japan to stop executions</a> [press release] after the hanging of four men in April 2009. In February 2009, a group of parliamentarians <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/japan-mps-propose-four-year-moratorium.php">proposed a four-year moratorium on the practice</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2008, the UN Human Rights Committee urged Japan to take steps to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-committee-urges-japan.php">abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2007, Japan's national bar association <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/japan-bar-association-calls-for.php">called for a moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] until new safeguards are enacted to prevent wrongful executions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kunz, who has admitted to working at the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/belzec.html">Belzec concentration camp</a> [HRP backgrounder] from 1942-1943, is accused of helping to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/07/2010728132256453542.html">murder 430,000 Jewish people</a> [Al Jazeera report] during his time at Belzec, and of shooting 10 other people in separate incidents. Kunz maintains that <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/07/28/2740253/germany-charges-90-year-old-in-nazi-era-murders">he never personally murdered anyone</a> [JTA report]. Kunz has been called as a witness in the case of fellow accused Nazi war criminal <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>]. In May, a German court denied a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">dismiss charges against Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">trial began in November</a> [JURIST report], marking the first time a Nazi war crimes trial will focus on a low-ranking foreigner rather than a commander. The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk faces 27,900 accessory accounts stemming from his alleged involvement as a guard at <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor concentration camp</a> [Death Camps backgrounder]. 

<p>In March, a German court sentenced former Nazi SS member Heinrich Boere to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-court-sentences-former-nazi-to.php">life in prison for the 1944 murders</a> [JURIST report] of three Dutch civilians. Boere was sentenced to death <em>in absentia</em> by a Dutch court in 1949, but the sentence was later commuted to life in prison. Boere never served his sentence, as one German court refused to extradite him because of the probability that he was a German national, and another refused the request that he serve his sentence in a German jail due to the likelihood the trial was unfair because Boere was not present for the proceedings. Boere plans to appeal the court's decision and will not begin serving his sentence until the appellate process is finished. In August, a German district court sentenced former Nazi army officer Josef Scheungraber to <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-court-convicts-nazi-officer-of.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for the 1944 reprisal killing of 10 Italian civilians. Scheungraber was convicted on 10 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for ordering soldiers to blow up a barn in Falzano di Cortona, Tuscany, after forcing 11 civilians inside.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A court in the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur obliged the local Internet provider Rosnet to block access to the sites in its region of the country, citing Russia's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Iike4Wrd8&feature=youtube_gdata">anti-extremism laws</a> [RT report, video]. The decision came after a video entitled "Russia for Russians," also a Russian extremist slogan, was posted on YouTube. The other sites were <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/youtube-banned-by-a-far-east-court/411266.html">blocked</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] for containing excerpts of Adolf Hitler's book <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> [Britannica backgrounder], which was banned by the Russian <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General's Office</a> [official website, in Russian] in March after it was found in violation of laws against extremism. In 2007, the Russian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">approved legislative amendments</a> [JURIST report] to change the prevailing definition of extremist crime in Russian law to include activities taken for "political or ideological hatred." Opponents of the legislation criticized the amendments as an attempt to curtail civil liberties and hamper democracy by putting restraints on media coverage and discouraging opposition campaigning.

<p>Last month, a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/pakistan-court-reimposes-ban-on-youtube-for-offensive-content.php">Pakistani court reimposed a ban on YouTube</a> [JURIST report] after content deemed offensive to Muslims resurfaced on the website when a previous ban was lifted in May. The court ordered the ban after evidence of content on the websites regarding the Prophet Muhammad and the Koran was presented at a hearing. Last year, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/bangladesh-lifts-ban-on-youtube-for.php">Bangladeshi officials lifted a ban on YouTube</a> [JURIST report] that had been imposed after a recording was posted in which <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=142">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [official profile, BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">profile</a>] is criticized by army officers over how she handled the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7912112.stm">mutiny</a> [BBC backgrounder] in late February 2009. In 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/china-blocks-youtube-access-after-tibet.php">Chinese government blocked Internet users</a> [JURIST report] in the country from accessing YouTube after videos of a government crackdown on Tibetan protesters challenging Chinese rule were posted on the site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appellants, known only as AF and AE due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence related to their cases, have been fighting their control orders, which confine them essentially to house-arrest conditions, for nearly two years. Last year, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">UK House of Lords</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Secretary</a> [official website] had to provide the suspects with more information about the evidence against them to satisfy the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text]. When the Secretary refused to adduce further evidence on the grounds that it would compromise counter-terrorism operations, the administrative division of the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/admin.htm">England and Wales High Cour</a>t [official website] <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2010/42.html">quashed</a> [decision text] the control orders for failure to meet evidentiary requirements. Upholding that ruling, the Court of Appeal declared the control orders invalid from the moment of their inception:<blockquote>[I]n my judgment, the appropriate remedy in all these cases is one of quashing <em>ab initio</em> ... I agree with the submission made on behalf of the controlees that, if the appropriate remedy were merely revocation, there is a risk that a breach of Convention rights would go substantially unremedied ... I would dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State in AF and AE.</blockquote>The government <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10788933">plans to appeal</a> [BBC report] to the Supreme Court.

<p>In June, the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-supreme-court-rules-curfew-restrictions-violated-appellants-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a control order requiring an anonymous appellant to live 150 miles away from his family and operated under a 16-hour curfew violated his rights under the ECHR. Such orders were created by the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2005/20050002.htm">Prevention of Terrorism ACT of 2005</a> (PTA) [text], which allows the British government to conduct surveillance and impose house arrest on suspects where there does not exist enough evidence to prosecute. The orders can also be used to forbid the use of mobile phones and the Internet. The system set up under PTA has been criticized by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] for what the human rights organization describes as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18823">criminal sanctions without trial</a> [press release] that are not compatible with the principles of human rights. AI has called for the repeal of the PTA and the abandonment of control orders, which it has described as "fundamentally flawed." In September, then-Home Secretary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2091320.stm">Alan Johnson</a> [BBC profile] said that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/uk-government-to-review-control-order.php">undertake a review</a> [JURIST report] of the system. Johnson issued a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090916/wmstext/90916m0001.htm#09091618000016">ministerial statement</a> [text] saying that his "current assessment is ... that the control order regime remains viable," but that he would "be keeping this assessment under review." In October 2007, the UK Law Lords ruled in a series of decisions that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-top-court-limits-control-orders.php">government can continue to impose control orders</a> [JURIST report] on terror suspects in lieu of detention, but said that some elements of the orders violate human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The injunction comes at the request of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], which filed its suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenging the constitutionality of the law</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Judge Susan Bolton rejected the DOJ's argument that the law should be enjoined in its entirety, finding that the individual provisions of the law were severable. Bolton issued the injunction against provisions of the law requiring the verification of the immigration status of people reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants and authorizing the warrantless arrest of those police have probable cause to believe have committed an offense that could lead to deportation. The court also enjoined a provision of the law requiring noncitizens to carry their registration papers with them at all times, agreeing with the DOJ's assertion that "the federal government has long rejected a system by which aliens' papers are routinely demanded and checked." Bolton ruled that the government was likely to prevail in its claim that these provisions are superseded by federal law, violating the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text], and would suffer irreparable harm if the provisions went into effect because they would impair its ability to enforce federal policy. The court declined to enjoin several other provisions of the law, finding that the DOJ was not likely to prevail in its claims against them. This included provisions making it a state crime to harbor illegal immigrants and allowing for the impoundment of vehicles used in their transportation. Bolton also rejected the argument that the law violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] by discriminating against interstate commerce.

<p>The DOJ filed its complaint earlier this month, arguing that the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The DOJ also claims that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy and will interfere with foreign relations with Mexico and other countries. The law has been widely criticized as unconstitutional and allegedly legalizing racial profiling. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-second-brief-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of the DOJ lawsuit, following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">submission of another <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. In the brief filed in support of the US, the ABA also argues that the Arizona law would interfere with law enforcement officers' public safety functions and infringe on both citizens' and noncitizens' constitutional rights by placing upon them the burden of proving their citizenship. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission would also propose reforms and promote the reduction and prevention of violence and crime. According to House sponsor <a href="http://delahunt.house.gov/">Bill Delahunt</a> (D-MA) [official website], the US incarcerates 2.3 million people, with prison costs soon reaching $75 billion. Delahunt praised the passage in the House, asserting that the bill "will assess the current crisis, reverse these disturbing trends and help save taxpayer money." Currently pending in the US <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website], the legislation has widespread bipartisan support and 39 co-sponsors. Senate sponsor <a href="http://webb.senate.gov/index.cfm">Jim Webb</a> (D-VA) [official website] <a href="http://webb.senate.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/07-28-2010-02.cfm">urged</a> [press release] the Senate to act on the bill, <a href="http://webb.senate.gov/newsroom/multimedia/07-28-2010-01.cfm">saying</a> [video]:<blockquote>This bill will take a long overdue, comprehensive review of our criminal justice system - taking a look at what's broken and what works. ... Essentially all elements in our country that are involved in this issues agree that we need to find the type of solution that's going to make our system more fair, more efficient, and reduce crime and criminal recidivism in our communities.</blockquote><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S.714:">The National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2010</a> [S 714 materials; <a href="http://webb.senate.gov/issuesandlegislation/criminaljusticeandlawenforcement/Criminal_Justice_Banner.cfm">backgrounder</a>] was initially introduced in the Senate by Webb in March 2009. In April, Delahunt introduced the companion legislation in the House. The bill was approved by the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] in January and now awaits full chamber approval.

<p>The legislation joins a series of recent US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] rulings scrutinizing the criminal justice system. In June, the Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-sentencing-guideline-changes-do-not-affect-modification-hearings.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">federal sentencing guidelines</a> [materials] do not provide for special consideration of changes in sentencing guidelines during <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00003582----000-.html">USC &#167; 3582(c)(2)</a> [text] sentence modification hearings, and are advisory only, although they had never ruled on the application to sentence modification hearings. A week earlier, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-upholds-method-for-calculating-good-time-credits.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003624----000-.html">Sentencing Reform Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 3624(b) text] method used by the federal <a href="http://www.bop.gov/">Bureau of Prisons</a> (BOP) [official website] permitting federal prison authorities to award prisoners credit against prison time as a reward for good behavior. In May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-life-sentences-for-juveniles-facing-non-homicide-charges.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] ban on cruel and unusual punishments prohibits the imprisonment of a juvenile for life without the possibility of parole as punishment for the juvenile's commission of a non-homicide offense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution, passed by a vote of 122-0 with 41 member states abstaining, also requires the UN Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/water/iexpert/Ind_expert_DeAlbuquerque.htm">Catarina de Albuquerque</a> [official profile], to report to the General Assembly annually. The initiative promotes progress to achieve <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs) [official website] to reduce social and economic harms by 2015, including decreasing the number of people who cannot reach or afford safe drinking water and do not have basic sanitation by half. The resolution also expressed concern that approximately 884 million people are without access to safe drinking water and more than 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. 

<p>In March, Bolivian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3203752.stm">President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bolivia-president-urges-un-to-declare.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to declare access to safe drinking water a basic human right and introduced the resolution. Morales' administration has been <a href="http://news.brunei.fm/2010/03/23/bolivia-celebrates-world-water-day-with-call-for-rational-use/">working to increase access</a> [NNN-Prensa Latina report] for Bolivian citizens to clean water since 2006, investing in new water and sewage systems throughout the country. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.saflii.org/bw/cases/BWHC/">Botswana High Court</a> [SAFLII database] ruled that the indigenous <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0102/feature6/index.html">Bushmen</a> [National Geographic backgrounder], or San, people <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/botswana-high-court-rules-against-water-rights-for-bushmen.php">cannot reopen a well</a> [JURIST report] or dig new wells in their village in the <a href="http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/attractions/central_kalahari_game_reserve.html">Central Kalahari Game Reserve</a> [official website]. The closest source of water for the Bushmen is 25 miles from their village. The Botswana government has argued that the tribe's village in the game reserve is not a formal settlement and, therefore, the government is not required to provide the Bushmen with water. Spokesmen for the tribe <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/botswana-tribe-to-bring-land-dispute.php">announced in January</a> [JURIST report] that they plan to take the land dispute issue to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icj.php">news archive</a>] because the government continues to ignore court orders granting land rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111s1789">Fair Sentencing Act of 2010</a> [S 1789 materials] would amend existing law to reduce the current sentencing ratio from 100:1 to 18:1. Under the existing law passed in 1986, an individual possessing five grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory five-year prison sentence, while an individual possessing powder cocaine would need to have 100 times that amount to receive the same sentence. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/28/us-end-sight-infamous-crack-cocaine">praised</a> [press release] the bill's passage, stating that the current law also created a racial disparity, with African Americans comprising 79.8 percent of all offenders sentenced for crack cocaine violations.  <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] also <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/July/10-ag-867.html">supported</a> [statement] the bill's passage, stating that it will "go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair." <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> member <a href="http://lamarsmith.house.gov/">Lamar Smith</a> (R-TX) [official websites] was the only member to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128830037">speak out against the bill</a> [NPR report], arguing that reducing penalties could lead to <a href="http://republicans.judiciary.house.gov/News/Read.aspx?id=358">increased violence in communities</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Crack cocaine is associated with a greater degree of violence than most other drugs. And more than any other drug, the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions. ... I cannot support legislation that might enable the violent and devastating crack cocaine epidemic of the past to become a clear and present danger.</blockquote>According to a <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/114xx/doc11413/s1789.pdf">cost estimate</a> [text, PDF] published by the <a href="http://cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> [official website] in March, the Fair Sentencing Act would save the federal prison system $42 million between 2011 and 2015. The bill will now be sent to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] for his consideration and signature. Obama called for a reduction in the sentencing disparity during his presidential campaign in 2008.

<p>The bill was introduced in the <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> by <a href="http://durbin.senate.gov/">Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL) [official websites] and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-passes-bill-reducing-cocaine.php">passed in March</a>, less than a week after the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-judiciary-committee-approves.php">unanimously approved the bill</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-passes-bill-to.php">voted 16-9 to approve a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have completely eliminated the sentencing disparity between the offenses. In April 2008, a study released by the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/USSC_Crack_Cocaine_Retroactivity_Data_Report_21_April_08.pdf">reported</a> [study, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">report</a>] that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses had their sentences reduced under an amendment to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials].  In 2007, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">USSC voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/PRESS/rel121107.htm">reduced crack cocaine penalties</a> [press release].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which the Russian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-upper-house-approves-bill-expanding-secret-police-powers.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, will give the FSB authority to question citizens about actions that may create the conditions for a crime and <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5816106,00.html">issue warnings</a> [DW report] not to engage in unapproved acts. Noncompliance may be punishable by fine or up to 15 days in prison. The KGB had similar authority to engage in preemptive questioning, a power that was often used to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/world/europe/17russia.html?_r=1">intimidate dissidents</a> [NYT report] in the USSR. Rights groups and members of the Russian legal community have <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/news/F26E6AA">condemned the law</a> [press release, in Russian], saying that it legalizes arbitrary detentions and extends the FSB's power beyond its authority.

<p>Russia faces ongoing criticism from the international community regarding its human rights record.  In October, the the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sova-center.ru/en/xenophobia/news-releases/2009/10/d17243/">issued a report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-report-criticizes-russia-on-human.php">report</a>] criticizing Russia's record on human rights and calling on the country to take extensive legal reform in order to guarantee its citizens rights such as fair trials and freedoms of speech and press.  Last June, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-judicial-reform-urged-by-council.php">urged substantial reforms</a> [JURIST report] to correct systemic problems in the Russian legal system, including the prevalence of political prosecutions and a lack of judicial independence.  Medvedev has <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">acknowledged the need for judicial reform</a> [JURIST report], saying that transparent courts would restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from seeking redress in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, upholding a lower court decision, held that the Fifth Amendment to the <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/">Bangladeshi Constitution</a> [text], which allowed the participation of religious political parties and legitimized military rule, violated the principle of secularism and representative democracy found in the Constitution's preamble. Relying heavily on the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decision of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0005_0137_ZO.html">Marbury v. Madison</a> [text] to reinforce the notion of judicial review, the court found that the supremacy of the Constitution over the actions of government officials required them to strike down the amendment for violating the constitutional principles that the "heroic [Bangladeshi] people ... sacrifice[d] their lives [for]." The court explained:<blockquote>[T]he second paragraph of the Preamble of the original Constitution ... spells out the high ideals of nationalism, socialism, democracy and secularism which was also reflected in Article 8 of the Constitution. [O]ur liberation war was fought on those high ideals and those high ideals inspired our heroic people to dedicate themselves and our brave martyrs to sacrifice their lives in the national liberation struggle and those ideals being the basis of our nationhood shall be the fundamental principles of the Constitution. ... [T]hose fundamental principles shall remain permanently as the guiding principles and as the ever lasting light house for our Republic.</blockquote>The court also found that the military rule from 1975-1990 was illegal, recommending the prosecution of the leaders of the former military government. Following the decision, Bangladeshi <a href="http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/hministeroffice.htm">Law Minister Shafiq Ahmed</a> [official profile] stated that future challenges to constitutional amendments that establish Islam as the state religion and incorporate <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/index.htm">Qur'anic</a> [text] verses would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_5T_bgbToWaGqK2gxXACMFuySog">likely be successful as well</a> [AFP report].

<p>The Fifth Amendment was passed in 1979 by the military government. Since this time, religious parties have grown in Bangladesh, numbering at more than two dozen before the court's decision. In 2008, the party of current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> won in a landslide over the party of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6975798.stm">Khaleda Zia</a> [BBC profiles], which was backed by several Islamist parties. Zia was also backed by the largest Islamist party, <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">Jamaat e Islami</a> (JI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Bangladesh's International Criminal Tribunal (ICT) <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-issues-arrest-warrants-for-islamist-leaders.php">issued four arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for several of JI's leaders for genocide, murder and torture, allegedly committed during <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The ICT was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in March</a> [JURIST report] to try those accused of committing war crimes during the 1971 war, in which Bangladeshi forces succeeded in gaining independence from Pakistan. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants, six Somali men alleged to have been involved in the April attack on the USS Ashland in the Gulf of Aden, pleaded not guilty to charges of piracy and assaulting a federal officer with a deadly weapon. Attorneys for the men argue that they could not have committed piracy because they did <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jlTMBh7vEEQP5x8Nkc8pNGvM8wmA">not seize or plunder the ship</a> [CP report]. The charge of piracy carries a mandatory life sentence if convicted. The trial is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ikox2w8uO1e80g1mndtiJU16gobQD9H8A35O0">scheduled to begin in October</a> [AP report]. Another group of suspected Somali pirates also pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in the district court. This group was indicted on similar charges in relation to the attack on the USS Nicholas, also in April. Their trial date was set for November. The 11 men were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ikox2w8uO1e80g1mndtiJU16gobQD9GRMLD04">charged earlier this month</a> [AP report] by a federal grand jury, adding on to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-prosecutors-indict-11-suspected.php">charges filed in April</a> [JURIST report], alleging that the suspects conspired to commit and did commit various offenses, including piracy and attack with the intent to plunder a vessel, noting that "the primary purpose of the conspiracy was to make money by means of piracy on the high seas." 

<p>Several suspected Somali pirates have faced charges in federal court this year. A Somali man charged with piracy <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/somalia-piracy-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-federal-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May to charges of hijacking, kidnapping and hostage taking related to an April 2009 attack on the US container ship <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/maersk-a.htm">Maersk Alabama</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Another group of nine <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/done-9-somalis-plead-not-guilty-to-piracy-charges.php">pleaded not guilty to piracy charges</a> [JURIST report] in May. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10126248">Somali officials have criticized</a> [BBC report] the US for exercising jurisdiction over Muse and other pirate suspects, insisting that piracy prosecutions should be conducted by an international tribunal. They have also asked that Somali pirate suspects be returned to Somalia, which lacks a functioning central government to address the piracy problem. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-opening-of-new-kenya-courtroom-for-piracy-trials.php">Kenya</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Couso, a television cameraman, was killed in 2003 when a US tank fired into the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad. The 3rd Division infantrymen named in the warrant, Sgt. Shawn Gibson, Capt. Philip Wolford and Lt. Col. Philip de Camp, maintain that they fired into the hotel at what they thought was an enemy combatant because they were being fired upon. A US military investigation has cleared them of wrongdoing, and US officials have said they will not extradite the soldiers. Pedraz said that he issued the warrant because the matter "may constitute a crime against the international community," and US officials have not cooperated in Spanish investigations into the incident.

<p>Earlier this month, the Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ordered a lower court to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-court-reopens-probe-into-2003-journalist-death-in-iraq.php">reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Couso's death. Pedraz <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-judge-reinstates-charges-against.php">reinstated the homicide charges</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 after they were dropped in 2007 due to lack of evidence. Pedraz initially <a href="http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/espana/doc/couso.html">ordered</a> [text, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2005/10/spanish-judge-orders-arrest-of-us.php">report</a>] the soldiers' arrest in 2005 after <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spanish-judge-wants-to-question-us.php">initiating investigations</a> [JURIST report] into the incident in June of that year. The order was reversed by a panel of judges for the National Court in 2006. The reversal was then overturned by Spain's Supreme Court, resulting in arrest warrants being <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/spain-reissues-arrest-warrant-for-us.php">reissued</a> [JURIST report] in January 2007.

The charges are in relation to statements made to the <a href="http://www.thesundayleader.lk/"><em>Sunday Leader</em></a> [media website] newspaper, which suggested that the government of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3602101.stm">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [BBC profile] ordered the killing of surrendering rebel leaders during the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/11407/sri_lankan_conflict.html">Sri Lankan civil war</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">news archive</a>]. At the hearing, the court <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/337040,opens-hearing-ex-army-commander.html">issued 20 summons</a> [DPA report] for witnesses to appear at the trial, which is scheduled for September 27 and is being held without a jury. Fonseka has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5geokbmH2dc0j0zPtdpGxlEcBvGWQ">maintained that he was misquoted</a> [AFP report] by the newspaper. If convicted, Fonseka could face between five and 20 years in prison. Fonseka also faces another pending criminal proceeding and two court-martials charging him with participating in politics while in uniform and with improperly awarding army procurement contracts. Despite this, Fonseka successfully won a seat in parliament in elections held in April. He maintains that the allegations are politically motivated. 

<p>In April, Fonseka appeared before the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/ListContent.do?language=E">Parliament</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sri-lanka-ex-army-chief-calls-for.php">call for his freedom</a> [JURIST report] and respect for the rule of law. Fonseka argued for his release from what he characterized as an illegal detention and a byproduct of injustice, while also <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8636478.stm">insisting on democratic improvements</a> [BBC report] and institution of the rule of law. He was temporarily released from military custody in order to attend the session, to which he traveled under guard. Earlier that month, Fonseka's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sri-lanka-ex-army-chief-court-martials.php">trials were postponed</a> [JURIST report] to allow the <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20COURT%20OF%20APPEAL%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Court of Appeals of Sri Lanka</a> [official website] to examine the legality of the court-martials. Fonseka was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-military-police-arrest.php">arrested by the military in February</a> [JURIST report] after losing presidential elections held the previous month. In March, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sri-lanka-ex-chief-justice-criticizes.php">criticized the treatment of the general</a> [JURIST report]. Sarath Nanda Silva, who retired from the <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] last year, accused the government of using the military justice system to prevent Fonseka from participating in April elections, and of violating Fonseka's civil rights in violation of the <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Introduction.htm">Constitution</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontwhitehouseback.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Obama administration is in danger of entrenching some of the most draconian aspects of the Bush administration's controversial national security policy, warns a new <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/EstablishingNewNormal.pdf">report</a>, [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/obama-administration-danger-establishing-new-normal-worst-bush-era-policies-says-a">press release</a>] from the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]  [press release] released Thursday. The report, titled "Establishing a New Normal: National Security, Civil Liberties, and Human Rights Under the Obama Administration," concludes that the first 18 months of the Obama White House betray a civil rights record that is "mixed, at best." Though the group concedes that "the Obama administration inherited a legal and moral morass" and has had some early successes reinstating certain civil rights protections undone by the Bush administration, it says that the Obama administration risks legitimizing controversial Bush-era policies through its refusal to take action to actively address the civil rights abuses those policies have perpetrated:<blockquote>[H]is second full day in office ... President Obama signed a series of executive orders that squarely repudiated some of the most egregious abuses of the Bush administration ... These auspicious first steps toward fulfilling candidate Obama's promise of change ... placed the power and prestige of the presidency behind restoration of the rule of law ... But ... on a range of issues including accountability for torture, [indefinite] detention of terrorism suspects, and use of lethal force against civilians, there is a very real danger that the Obama administration will enshrine permanently within the law policies and practices that were widely considered extreme and unlawful during the Bush administration.</blockquote>The report emphasizes the administration's failure to break with Bush-era policies relating to accountability and transparency, targeted killing of terrorist suspects, warrantless surveillance, the use of military commissions and other civil rights abuses for which the Bush administration was widely criticized. It urged the administration to restore "the nation's historic commitment to the rule of law." 

<p>Last month, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-renews-call-accountability-start-torture-awareness-month">called</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/aclu-renews-calls-for-bush-era-detainee-torture-investigation.php">report</a>] on the Obama administration to stop shielding Bush administration officials from civil suit and criminal prosecution stemming from treatment of detainees in US custody, touching on issues prominently addressed in today's report. Throughout June, the organization publicized previously classified documents detailing the detainee abuses of the Bush administration in honor of <a href="http://www.tortureawareness.com/">Torture Awareness Month</a> [official website]. In April, an ACLU <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] suit resulted in the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of internal <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] revealing that a former agency head may have agreed to the destruction of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] showing harsh interrogations of terror suspects. Last May, the ACLU harshly <a href="http://aclu.org/safefree/torture/39555prs20090509.html">criticized</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/rights-groups-decry-obama-military.php">report</a>] the Obama administration's plans to <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/obama-may-continue-military-commission.php">revive</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">military commissions</a> system to try <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives] detainees, another of the major issues in today's report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement comes a week after riots by members of the Roma community sparked by the shooting of a young man, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5848059,00.html">resulting in the deployment of 300 troops</a> [DW report]. The government aims to dismantle half of illegal Roma camps in the country within three months and to immediately deport of all those found to have broken the law. In explaining the need for the measures, the government said:<blockquote>The President ... found [the] situation of lawlessness that characterized the Roma people [totally unacceptable]. 200 illegal settlements have been ... identified [as] sources of illicit trafficking, deeply unworthy living conditions, exploitation of children for begging, prostitution or crime. He asked the Government to proceed, within three months, the evacuation of these facilities whenever the existing law allows. [Additionally], legislative reform will be undertaken to make [the dismantling of illegal settlements] more efficient.</blockquote>The move has been criticized by human rights groups, such as the <a href="http://www.ldh-france.org">League of Human Rights</a> [advocacy website, in French], which has <a href="http://www.ldh-france.org/Les-Roms-et-Gens-du-voyage-ne">accused Sarkozy of using the Roma as a "scapegoat"</a> [press release, in French] and stigmatizing the Roma community. Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux refuted this, arguing that the goal of the measures were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10798440">not to target any particular group</a> [BBC report], but to promote public safety. 15,000 Roma are currently estimated to live in France. 

<p>In July,  the Council of Europe's <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/default_en.asp">European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance</a> (ECRI) [official website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-body-claims-racism-increasing-during-economic-crisis.php">racist violence and rhetoric has risen</a> [JURIST report] in Europe during 2009, following the recent economic crisis. The report cites increasing hostility toward the Roma minority as well as the continuing discrimination against Muslims as seen in the proposed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa bans</a> [JURIST news archive] as two examples of groups facing more discriminatory actions. In February, Italian authorities began <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-begins-dismantling-roma-camps.php">dismantling illegal immigrant camps</a> [JURIST report] around Rome heavily populated by members of the Roma minority following the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl by East European immigrants, which led to public outcry and vigilante reprisals. Opposition parties have voiced disapproval of the move, and the Vatican has warned against scapegoating. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeal and <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_072910_MotionForExpeditedBriefingSchedule.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] for expedited briefing and hearing schedule asks the court to establish a timeline for briefs, schedule oral arguments for the week of September 13 and expedite its ruling. Explaining Arizona's reasons for the appeal, Brewer said:<blockquote>If the federal government wants to be in charge of illegal immigration and they want no help from states, it then needs to do its job...Illegal immigration is an ongoing crisis the State of Arizona did not create and the federal government has refused to fix. SB 1070 protects all of us, every Arizona citizen and everyone here in our state lawfully. It ensures that the constitutional rights of ALL in Arizona are undiminished. ... Our state taxpayers cannot sustain the outrageous costs of illegal immigration, and its continued erosion of our time-honored legal immigration traditions.</blockquote>Wednesday's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] came at the request of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], which filed its suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenging the constitutionality of the law</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Judge Susan Bolton issued the injunction against provisions of the law requiring the verification of the immigration status of people reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants and authorizing the warrantless arrest of those police have probable cause to believe have committed an offense that could lead to deportation. The court also enjoined a provision of the law requiring noncitizens to carry their registration papers with them at all times. The court declined to enjoin several other provisions of the law, finding that the DOJ was not likely to prevail in its claims against them, including making it a state crime to harbor illegal immigrants and allowing for the impoundment of vehicles used in their transportation.

<p>In its complaint, the DOJ argued that the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The DOJ also claims that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy and will interfere with foreign relations with Mexico and other countries. The law has been widely criticized as unconstitutional and allegedly legalizing racial profiling. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-second-brief-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of the DOJ lawsuit, following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">submission of another <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. In the brief filed in support of the US, the ABA also argues that the Arizona law would interfere with law enforcement officers' public safety functions and infringe on both citizens' and noncitizens' constitutional rights by placing upon them the burden of proving their citizenship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pustivuk was <a href="http://www.sipa.gov.ba/en/index.php?full=8541">arrested</a> [press release] on July 13 in Bijeljina and has been held in custody since. According to a statement by the Prosecutor's Office, Pustivuk is accused of taking part in a May and June 1992 "attack on civilians which resulted in the death and severe bodily injuries to civilians, some of whom were minors," as a member of the Bosnian Serb special police unit. Pustivuk is charged with the criminal offense of War Crimes against Civilians in violation of Article 173(1) in conjunction with Articles 180(1), and 29 of the <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/criminal-code-of-bih.pdf">Criminal Code of BiH</a> [text, PDF]. Pustivuk is also charged with the unlawful detention, deprivation of liberty of civilians, and violating the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600022?OpenDocument">Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War</a> and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/475?OpenDocument">Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts</a> provisions of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [texts]. The indictment has been submitted to the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?id=280&jezik=e">Court of BiH</a> [official website]. 

<p>The BiH war crimes court was set up in 2005 to relieve the caseload of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and is authorized to try lower-level war crime suspects. The court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bosnia-war-crimes-court-hands-down.php">delivered its first sentences</a> [JURIST report] against war crimes suspects from Yugoslavia's violent ethnic conflicts of the 1990s in July 2008, convicting seven of genocide for their involvement in killings committed at the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison camp. The ICTY retains jurisdiction over high-level war crimes, such as those against Bosnian Serb wartime leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/703/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] and General <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mladic">news archive</a>], who are charged with genocide for their alleged roles is the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

The complaint, filed on behalf of six same-sex couples, was in response to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/hawaii-governor-vetoes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">veto of legislation</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov">Governor Linda Lingle</a> (R) [official website] that would have created same-sex civil unions. The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.courts.state.hi.us/general_information/contact/oahu.html">First Circuit Court of Hawaii</a> [official website], argues that, by failing to provide same-sex couples with the same rights and benefits available to opposite-sex couples, the state is violating the same-sex couples' right to equal protection, due process and privacy under the <a href="http://hawaii.gov/lrb/con/">Hawaii Constitution</a> [text]. The plaintiffs allege that, by providing only reciprocal beneficiary status, a legal relationship offering limited benefits to same-sex couples, the state is impermissibly denying same-sex couples' right to equal protection by giving their relationship "inferior legal status" and providing an "insufficient and defective safety net for their families." Additionally, the complaint argues that the lack of equal status interferes with the plaintiffs' rights to private family life and would survive no level of scrutiny because it reflects "moral disapproval and antipathy toward lesbians and gay men serv[ing] no legitimate government interest." Explaining the harm caused by these constitutional violations, the complaint argues:<blockquote>The State's relegation of same-sex couples to the inadequate status of reciprocal beneficiaries subjects the Plaintiff couples to legal vulnerability and related stress, while depriving them of the dignity and legitimacy of a legal status that, while still unequal to marriage, would at least recognize their equal entitlement to the same rights, benefits and obligations as are provided to different-sex couples who marry. The State's family relationship scheme ... sends a clear and purposeful message that the State views lesbian and gay people as secondclass citizens who are undeserving of the legal sanction, protections and support that heterosexual people and their families enjoy.</blockquote>The lawsuit stops short of seeking recognition of same-sex marriage, noting that the <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/">state legislature</a> [official website] has the constitutional authority to define marriage under a 1998 amendment passed following a 1993 <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9275123432984088983">Hawaii Supreme Court decision</a> [text] requiring the state to show a compelling reason to deny same-sex marriage.

<p>The ACLU first <a href="http://www.acluhawaii.org/news.php?id=391&PHPSESSID=a5bd9f81a8d768f91ba038d73fc50764">indicated it would be filing the lawsuit</a> [press release] earlier this month shortly after Lingle's veto. Last week, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed a lawsuit seeking to force Montana</a> [JURIST report] to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. The lawsuit seeks declaratory judgment that the state must provide a legal status to same-sex couples that confers the same rights and obligations as marriage under the equal protection, due process, privacy and dignity under provisions of the <a href="http://leg.mt.gov/css/Laws%20and%20Constitution/Current%20Constitution.asp">Montana Constitution</a> [text]. Several jurisdictions in the US have legalized same-sex marriage or recognized same-sex civil unions. Same-sex civil unions that confer the same rights as marriage are currently recognized in <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">Washington</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/new-jersey-civil-unions-bill-signed.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oregon-gay-rights-bills-signed-into-law.php">Oregon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/nevada-legislature-passes-same-sex.php">Nevada</a> [JURIST reports]. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">DC</a> legalized same-sex marriage, joining <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee, charged with monitoring compliance with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], made a series of recommendations in order to bring the Israeli government into compliance with the covenant, to which it is a state party. It went on to call for an end to the blockade on Gaza, noting that a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-agrees-to-ease-blockade-in-gaza-strip.php">recent easing</a> [JURIST report] was insufficient to ensure that Gazans had access to basic necessities. The committee also called into question the independence of the Israeli government's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">internal investigation</a> into the flotilla incident, urging Israel to invite in an international inquiry, something which <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/israel-not-expected-to-cooperate-with-flotilla-probe.php">Israel has refused to do</a> [JURIST reports]. The committee stated:<blockquote>While noting the preliminary findings of the State party's investigation into the incident, the Committee is concerned at the absence of independence of the commission of inquiry and the prohibition to question the officials of the State party's armed forces involved in the incident. The State party should lift its military blockade of the Gaza Strip, insofar as it adversely affects the civilian population. The State party should invite an independent, international fact-finding mission to establish the circumstances of the boarding of the flotilla, including its compatibility with the Covenant.</blockquote>The committee went on to criticize Israel's noncompliance with the covenant in several other areas. It called on Israel to amend its <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/government/law/basic%20laws/">Basic Law</a> [text] to include general provisions for nondiscrimination, which are currently lacking, and urged Israel to enforce the provisions of the covenant in Gaza, the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/palestine/west-bank.htm">West Bank</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/golan-heights">Golan Heights</a> [History backgrounder]. The Israeli government argues that this is not required due to an ongoing state of war, something the committee disputes. The committee also called on Israel to repeal its <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/israel-parliament-votes-to-extend-citizenship-law.php">citizenship law</a>, outlaw the use of torture in all circumstances, end construction of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-begins-moving-west-bank-security.php">separation wall</a>, reform its <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-palestine-home-demolitions.php">housing policies</a> [JURIST reports] and conduct a credible investigation into international human rights violations during <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Operation+Cast+Lead">Operation Cast Lead</a> [JURIST news archive]. 

<p>Earlier this week, a senior Israeli official announced that his government would not cooperate with an investigation into the incident conducted by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], but will comply with a separate UN investigation created under the authority of <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website]. Also in July, an Israeli military probe found insufficient intelligence and planning in the raid, but also concluded that no punishments were necessary. The military probe was conducted at the same time as a civilian one established by Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] last month. In June, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/gaza-blockade-violates-international-law-icrc.php">called for an end to the blockade</a> [JURIST report], which it labeled a violation of international humanitarian law. The organization described the blockade as collective punishment, a war crime under Article 33 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/com/380-600038?opendocument">Geneva Conventions</a> [text; ICRC <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">backgrounder</a>], and called on the international community to work to persuade Israel to lift the closure. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcaliforniaseal.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Two prospective third party congressional candidates and six California voters filed a <a href="http://gautamdutta.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sb-6-complaint-7-28-102.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Thursday seeking to <a href="http://gautamdutta.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/sb-6-field-v-bowen-notice-of-motion-final-7-29-10.pdf">enjoin enforcement</a> [motion, PDF] of <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/14/">Proposition 14</a> [text], which alters the primary election system, creating an open primary where only the top two vote-getters would advance to the general election. Proposition 14 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/california-voters-opt-to-change-primary-election-system.php">approved by voters last month</a> [JURIST report] and changes elections to create a system in which all candidates for a state or federal office except for president would run in a single primary regardless of political affiliation. From this, only the two candidates with the most votes would appear on the ballot in the general election. The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/">Superior Court of San Fransisco County</a> [official website], challenges the constitutionality of two provisions, one which disallows state election officials from counting write-in ballots while still providing a space for write-ins, and one that only allows primary candidates to list their party affiliations if they are members of one of six parties qualified for the ballot by the state. The complaint alleges that the write-in provisions violate the free speech, due process and equal protection rights of voters under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">US</a> and <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California</a> [texts] constitutions. In urging the court to issue an injunction against the enforcement of the law, the motion for preliminary injunction states:<blockquote>California voters were lured into an insidious trap [by Proposition 14]. Eager to reform the way our elections are conducted, a slim majority of voters approved [it], which promised to "protect and preserve the right of every Californian to vote for the candidate of his or her choice." However, many voters did not know that by voting for Proposition 14, they were also approving ... a pernicious law that tramples on our fundamental right to vote and run for office[.] ... Because SB 6 now threatens to disenfranchise voters and muzzle candidates, time is of the essence. Unless this Court swiftly issues a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs and similarly situated voters and candidates will suffer imminent and irreparable harm.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/c.jrLZK2PyHmF/b.947937/k.CC3A/Home.htm">Democratic</a>, <a href="http://www.cagop.org/">Republican</a> and <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/">Green</a> [party websites] parties of California, in addition to other third parties, have also been considering a lawsuit to enjoin enforcement of the law, which is set to go into effect in 2011.

<p>In June, the proposition was approved by <a href="http://vote.sos.ca.gov/maps/prop14.htm">53.7 percent</a> [results] of voters. Supporters of the change have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-california-openprimary-20100610,0,7810407.story">described it as necessary</a> [LAT report] to alleviate the strong ideological opposition in the <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/">state legislature</a> [official website]. California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/index.php">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> [official website], who included the ballot initiative in his 2010 budget, <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/speech/15321/">praised the measure</a> [statement], describing it as a sign of a "sweeping change." The new primary system immediately faced heavy criticism from third parties. The Green Party of California <a href="http://www.cagreens.org/press/pr100609.shtml">described the new system</a> [press release] as designed to "keep dissenting voices off the ... November ballot." Proposition 14 was based largely on the system used in Washington state, which was implemented there in 2004 after the passage of <a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/guide/text/872.pdf">Initiative 872</a> [text, PDF]. In 2008, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/go-supreme-court-rules-washington-state.php">upheld Washington's primary election system</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional against a <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] challenge, overturning a contrary decision by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. Louisiana has a similar system, but, under that system, a candidate who garners over 50 percent of the vote in the primary will forgo the general election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission will look into accusations that former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gloria+arroyo">news archive</a>] and members of her administration rigged the 2004 presidential election, misused government funds and profited from government contracts. Aquino <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-to-create-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">announced plans to create the commission</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, prompting a call for him to issue an executive order to make the commission official and clear up any ambiguity regarding its authority. Signing the executive order, Aquino <a href="http://www.gov.ph/2010/07/30/statement-on-the-signing-of-executive-order-no-1-establishing-the-truth-commission/">said</a> [statement], "[t]he process of bringing a necessary closure to the allegations of official wrongdoing and impunity has begun." The commission, set to finish its work by 2012, will have the power to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iOBim8-K_Ycna8EHyZvmhd4JXScA">recommend or file charges</a> [AFP report]. Arroyo has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

<p>Arroyo was elected to the lower house of parliament in April after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">receiving permission to run for the seat</a> [JURIST report] despite protests that her presidency gave her an unfair advantage. In March, Aquino and other presidential candidates criticized as "unjust" a Supreme Court ruling that allowed Arroyo to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">appoint a replacement for the retiring chief justice</a> [JURIST report], who planned to step down a week after the May presidential elections. Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] in December for the first time in 23 years in the wake of a massacre in the Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. In February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">prosecutors charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the massacre. A Manila trial court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-189.php">ordered the arrest of 189 more suspects</a> [JURIST report] in March.

Glavas was convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/croatia-lawmaker-convicted-of-war.php">sentenced to 10 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 for ordering the torture and death of Croatian Serbs in the town of Osijek in 1991 during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Serbo-Croatian War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. In confirming the decision of the lower court but reducing the sentence, the Supreme Court held that the war crimes counts of which Glavas was convicted should have been one count instead of two. The court rejected the prosecutor's arguments seeking a higher sentence for Glavas, which could have been as high as 20 years under the charges against him. The court also reduced the sentences of three of Glavas' co-defendants. Glavas has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gfiRu5sAtXbAS0BfnrYS4cjk0BCg">maintained his innocence</a> [AFP report] throughout the proceedings, stating that the convictions are politically motivated. Glavas' lawyer has promised to appeal the decision to the <a href="http://www.usud.hr/default.aspx?Show=&G1=&G2=&G3=&m1=&m2=&Lang=en">Constitutional Court</a> [official website].

<p>A Bosnian state court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/bosnia-court-refuses-to-extradite.php">refused to extradite Glavas</a> [JURIST report] to Croatia to serve a sentence for war crimes in 2009. Glavas, who holds dual Bosnian and Croatian citizenship, fled to Bosnia to avoid serving his sentence. Shortly after fleeing Croatia in an effort to avoid the sentence, Glavas was arrested on an Interpol warrant in Bosnia. In 2008, Glavas was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/croatia-parliament-strips-lawmakers.php">stripped of his parliamentary immunity</a> [JURIST report] so that lawyers could proceed with his prosecution in Croatia.

The SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp21605.pdf">alleged</a> [complaint, PDF] that Citigroup "repeatedly made misleading statements about the extent of its holdings of assets backed by sub-prime in earnings calls and public filings." Citigroup represented that its sub-prime exposure was $13 billion or less, when it was more than $50 billion at all times, which SEC officials say contributed to the economic crisis.

<p>The 2007 <a href="http://widerimage.reuters.com/timesofcrisis/">sub-prime mortgage crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] was precipitated by banks switching from funding mortgage loans through customer deposits to a new model where they sold the mortgages to bond markets, resulting in the banks being having less incentive to check the mortgages they issued. Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives voted 237 to 192 to approve the final version of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04173:">financial reform legislation</a> [HR 4173 materials], which focuses on increasing regulation in the financial sector. The House and Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-house-senate-reconcile-financial-reform-bills.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the final version of the bill, but were forced to re-open negotiations following the death of Democratic Senator Robert Byrd  (WV) [official website] in order to ensure the bill's final passage in the Senate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court set a briefing schedule with the opening brief due August 26 and the answering brief due September 23, and scheduled a hearing to occur the week of November 1. No extensions will be granted "absent extraordinary and compelling circumstances." The court <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/07/29/10-16645Response.pdf">indicated</a> [response to motion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/rules.htm">Ninth Circuit Rule 3-3(b)</a> [text], governing preliminary injunction appeals, should set the appropriate time frame for the appeal. On Thursday, Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/arizona-appeals-order-partially-blocking-immigration-law.php">expedited appeal</a> [JURIST report] asking the court to establish a timeline for briefs, with the opening brief due August 12, the response brief due August 26, and schedule oral arguments for the week of September 13. 

<p>The preliminary <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report], issued Wednesday, came at the request of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], which filed its suit <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenging the constitutionality of the law</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Judge Susan Bolton issued the injunction against provisions of the law requiring the verification of the immigration status of people reasonably suspected of being illegal immigrants, authorizing the warrantless arrest of those police have probable cause to believe have committed an offense that could lead to deportation, and requiring noncitizens to carry their registration papers with them at all times. The law has been widely criticized as unconstitutional and allegedly legalizing racial profiling. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-second-brief-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed an amicus curiae brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of the DOJ lawsuit, following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">submission of another amicus curiae brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. In the brief filed in support of the US, the ABA argued that the Arizona law would interfere with law enforcement officers' public safety functions and infringe on both citizens' and noncitizens' constitutional rights by placing upon them the burden of proving their citizenship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case, filed under the <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/cafta-dr-dominican-republic-central-america-fta">Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (CAFTA-DR) [text], will be the first time the US has pursued a labor violations claim against a free trade partner.  Addressing Guatemala's labor standards, Kirk said: <blockquote>We want to see the Government of Guatemala take specific and effective action - including, if appropriate, legislative reforms - to improve the systemic failures in enforcement of Guatemalan labor law. In addition, the issue of labor-related violence is a matter of serious concern to the United States. Our request for consultations also expresses our grave concerns about this problem and indicates that we intend to take this issue up with the Government of Guatemala in the near future.</blockquote> Also on Friday, <a href="http://www.dol.gov/_sec/welcome.htm">US Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/ilab/ILAB20101078.htm">announced</a> [press release] that the US has requested labor consultations with Guatemala and expressed concern about the "labor-related violence in Guatemala, a problem which is serious and apparently deteriorating." If within 90 days the US and Guatemala fail to resolve the issue, the dispute could go before an arbitration panel. Ultimately, if Guatemala is found guilty of violating CAFTA-DR, it could be subject to a yearly penalty of $15 million, which will fund the enforcement of its labor laws.

<p>In April 2008 the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/">American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (AFL-CIO) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/issues/jobseconomy/globaleconomy/upload/guatemala_petition.pdf">public submission</a> [text, PDF] under CAFTA-DR claiming Guatemala had failed to enforce its labor laws. Following the submission, the US <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> (DOL) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/otla/20090116Guatemala.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] highlighting Guatemala's ineffective enforcement of those laws, alleging its failure to meet its obligation under CAFTA-DR. CAFTA-DR was <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/president-bush-signs-central-american.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in 2005, making it the first official trade pact between the US and Central America. CAFTA ends tariffs against US products in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Honduras, and ensures those countries duty-free access to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">President Nicolas Sarkozy's</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nicolas+sarkozy">news archive</a>] came to power in 2007 the number of people in France <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/30/AR2010073003214.html?hpid=sec-world">taken into custody and questioned without charge has exploded</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. In 2001 there were 336,718; in 2009, there were about 790,000. The ruling comes four months after the constitutionality of police custody under <a href="http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&c=34&r=3912">article 63-4</a> [text] of French criminal procedure code was initially challenged.

<p>French defense lawyers have been arguing for years that the practice of detaining suspects without reading them rights or bringing charges is an unethical method of forcing people to confess. The campaign for <a href="http://www.jeneparleraiquenpresencedemonavocat.fr/">custody reform </a>[advocacy website, in French] has gained momentum over the past few months as a result of recent decisions by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] in <u>Salduz v. Turkey</u>, <u>Mooren v. Germany</u> and <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=858391&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Koslenik v. Ukraine</a> [judgment], which called a lack of safeguards during police custody a violation of article 6 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. French lawyers and human rights groups have demanded that all suspects in police custody be given the right to see a lawyer immediately and access to a lawyer during interrogation, as well as be informed of their right to remain silent.</p>]]></content:encoded>
