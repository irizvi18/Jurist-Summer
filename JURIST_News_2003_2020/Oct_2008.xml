		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Absentee voting began Tuesday in Ohio after the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default_highres.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] and two federal district courts rejected Republican Party challenges to an Ohio secretary of state <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/Upload/elections/directives/2008/Dir2008-63.pdf">directive</a> [PDF text]. By a 4-3 vote, the state Supreme Court on Monday <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/2008/2008-ohio-4969.pdf">upheld</a> [case announcement, PDF] an interpretation of Ohio <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/35">election statutes</a> [text] by <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner</a> [official website] allowing a one-week overlap before the end of voter registration and after the beginning of absentee balloting. The Supreme Court was ruling on a <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/clerk_of_court/ecms/resultsbycasenumber.asp?type=3&year=2008&number=1813&myPage=searchbycasenumber.asp">petition</a> [case materials] filed by voters who alleged that Ohio law required a voter to be registered for 30 days before casting a ballot. Although the court has not yet released an opinion explaining its reasoning, it concluded that voters must be registered 30 days before the election, rather than 30 days before applying for or completing an absentee ballot. Brunner released a <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/PressReleases/2008%20Press%20Releases/20080929a.aspx">statement</a> [press release] calling the decision &quot;a victory for all Ohio voters.&quot; She continued: <blockquote>It should send a message to the forces of confusion and chaos that our top goal must be protecting Ohioans&#8217; voting rights. The Ohio Supreme Court today moved quickly to clarify that any unregistered Ohioan may both register and vote on the same day at boards or elections or their satellite locations in Ohio for a period of seven days. </blockquote>Robert T. Bennett, chairman of the <a href="http://www.ohiogop.org/">Ohio Republican Party</a> expressed disappointment in the decision, <a href="http://www.ohiogop.org/press/articles/2008/09/statement-chairman-bennett-regarding-court-rulings-issue-same-day-registratio">accusing Brunner</a> [press release] of &quot;partisan efforts to aide the Democrat turnout strategy.&quot; Also on Monday, a federal district judge in Cleveland <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/issues/VotingRights/Order_TROAgainstMadisonGranted2008_0929.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in another lawsuit that the Madison County Board of Elections must comply with the directive. In Columbus, a second district judge declined to rule on the overlap issue in light of the Supreme Court decision, although he did enter a temporary restraining order allowing observers to be present when absentee voters cast ballots in person. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gmJpgsrR27lwSUQ24_WSSrU0W-JwD93H2NHO3">more</a>. The <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> has <a href="http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/09/30/copy/supco_ruling.ART_ART_09-30-08_B1_USBFH33.html?adsec=politics&sid=101">local coverage</a>. Cleveland&#39;s <em>Plain Dealer</em> has <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/plaindealer/stories/index.ssf?/base/business-8/1222763617174910.xml&coll=2">additional local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Voters and advocacy groups have challenged Ohio elections procedures since the state&#39;s pivotal role in the 2004 presidential campaign. In February, a federal judge <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/issues/VotingRights/ACLUvBrunnerCaseUpdate2008_0210.asp">rejected</a> [ACLU materials] the American Civil Liberties Union&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/aclu-asks-federal-court-to-block-paper.php">request for a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the state&#39;s largest county from using a paper balloting system in the March primary election. The state later agreed not to use paper ballots in subsequent elections. In 2006, the state and advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/ohio-voter-id-law-case-settled.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit challenging the state&#39;s voter identification law. According to that agreement, voters must continue to show proof of ID when applying for an absentee ballot, but absentee ballots obtained without ID were still counted after a settlement.<br /><br />10/1/08 - The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] late Tuesday issued a brief <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0355p-06.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF text] denying the Ohio Republican Party&#39;s motion for an injunction requiring that absentee ballots cast by newly registered voters be segregated from other ballots. The court also granted Brunner&#39;s motion to stay the district court&#39;s temporary restraining order allowing observers to be present when absentee votes are cast in person. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gmJpgsrR27lwSUQ24_WSSrU0W-JwD93HBGS80">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of former Yugoslav army chief of staff and general <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/perisic/cis-perisic.pdf">Momcilo Perisic</a> [ICTY case information sheet; Trial Watch <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/momcilo_perisic_638.html">backgrounder</a>], was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pa349e.html">delayed indefinitely</a> [press release] Wednesday as there was a procedural glitch in the naming of judges at the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> [official website]. Perisic was indicted before by ICTY in 2005 on <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/per-sai080205e.pdf">charges</a> [indictment, PDF] including murder, persecution on grounds of politics, race, or religion, and unjustifed attacks on civilians in the early 1990s in conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. As well as being held individually responsible for these acts, Perisic is also being charged with command responsibility for the actions of his subordinates under <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc/index.htm">Article 7(3) of the ICTY Statute</a> [official text]. ICTY spokesperson Nerma Jelacic said that the Tribunal was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/briefing/2008/pb081001.htm">awaiting formal approval</a> [press briefing] from the United Nations for assignment of judges to this trial. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081001/wl_afp/warcrimesserbiabosniacroatiasrebrenica_081001105218">more</a>.

His surrender was under a policy initiated by <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/vlada/predsednik.php">Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica</a> [official profile] that encouraged voluntary surrender rather than controversial arrests.

This year&#39;s event, entitled &quot;Treaty Event 2008: Towards Universal Participation And Implementation - Dignity And Justice For All Of Us,&quot; celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. On Wednesday, Cameroon signed the  <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [text], while Greece and Iceland signed the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances</a> [text]. The Convention on Enforced Disappearances was also signed by Laos and Tanzania on Monday. On Monday, Laos also ratified the <a href="http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/harmone.pdf">Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods</a> [text, PDF], as well as the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/english/Terrorism/Conv12.pdf">International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism</a> [text, PDF]. Iran, Switzerland, the Republic of Congo, Zambia, the Philippines, Belarus, and 32 other states signed a variety of treaties and conventions during the week-long Treaty Event. The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28365&Cr=treaty&Cr1=">more</a>.<br /><br />According to the 1969 <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> [text, PDF], proposed international treaties are adopted through the consent of the states participating in the treaty-making process, or by the action of an international conference specially convened for the establishment of the treaty, usually by a two-thirds vote of the participating states. Signatures to international treaties do not establish consent to be bound by the treaty, only the willingness of the signing state to continue the treaty-making process by proceeding with national ratification, acceptance, or approval, and to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. More than 500 <a href="http://treaties.un.org/Pages/DB.aspx?path=DB/MTDSGStatus/pageIntro_en.xml">international treaties and agreements</a> [UN treaty status database] have been concluded since the inception of the UN in June 1945.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=08-1266P.01A">ruled</a> [opinion text] that the <a href="http://www.usps.com/">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) [official website] was entitled to immunity in a lawsuit alleging that a postal employee had interfered with the delivery of a political opponent&#39;s campaign fliers ahead of a municipal election. The court held that such conduct was covered by a postal-matter exception to the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_VI_20_171.html">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> [text], which provides that the USPS is immune from &quot;[a]ny claim arising out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matters.&quot; In affirming the district court&#39;s decision, a three-judge panel wrote in an unsigned opinion: <blockquote>[C]ases holding that theft of mail is a &quot;loss&quot; for purposes of &sect; 2680(b) directly undermine [plaintiff&#39;s] position, since theft is of course a form of intentional misconduct. We think it entirely reasonable to say, as these cases have, that mail that is stolen by a postal employee is thereby &quot;lost&quot; from the postal system. </blockquote>The First Circuit cited a 2006 US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/04-848.html">case</a> [<u>Dolan v. USPS</u> text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/supreme-court-rules-in-federal.php">report</a>] holding that the postal-matter exception generally preserves immunity for &quot;injuries arising, directly or consequentially, because mail either fails to arrive at all or arrives late, in damaged condition, or at the wrong address.&quot;<br /><br />The case arose in November 2005, when Joseph Kelly Levasseur ran for re-election to an alderman&#39;s seat in <a href="http://www.manchesternh.gov/website/">Manchester, New Hampshire</a> [official website]. As part of his campaign, he hired a publishing company to produce pamphlets to be mailed to voters. The pamphlets were never delivered, and Levasseur lost the election by 70 votes. Levasseur alleged that David McCloskey, a USPS employee and campaign volunteer for Levasseur&#39;s opponent, either stole or hid the pamphlets to prevent them from reaching voters. After the USPS denied his administrative claim, Levasseur filed a complaint in US <a href="http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of New Hampshire</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.websupp.org/data/DNH/1:06-cv-00284-22-DNH.pdf">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [opinion, PDF] last year as barred by the postal-matter exception.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://cpt.coe.int/en/">European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> (CPT) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/gbr/2008-27-inf-eng.htm">report</a>  [text] Wednesday expressing concern over a proposed <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/counterterrorism.html"> UK anti-terror bill</a> [materials; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7207659.stm">Q/A</a>] which would allow authorities to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=42+days+UK">detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days</a> [JURIST news archive]. The group said that to decrease the risk of mistreatment, the maximum period for police to hold uncharged suspects before transferring them to a prison should be reduced to 14 days, the period between court appearances of the suspects should be no longer than four days, and those appearances should be in person.  The group, which monitors prisoner treatment in Europe under the <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/documents/ecpt.htm">European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text], explained:<blockquote>The existing - and a fortiori possible new - provisions regarding the permissible length of pre-charge detention in cases falling under the terrorism legislation are a matter of considerable concern to the CPT. The Committee has no intention of entering into the current debate on the arguments for and against the length of pre-charge detention of terrorist suspects in the United Kingdom. However, as the CPT has emphasised in the past, in the interests of the prevention of ill-treatment, the sooner a criminal suspect passes into the hands of a custodial authority which is functionally and institutionally separate from the police, the better. Consequently, the Committee must insist that neither the existing nor any new provisions in this area should result in criminal suspects spending a prolonged period of time in police custody.</blockquote> The British government also released its <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/gbr/2008-28-inf-eng.htm">response</a> [text] to the CPT report on Wednesday, saying that it recognized its responsibility to protect the rights of those held, but that its current safeguards were sufficient in light of countervailing national security concerns. The British House of Lords is scheduled to vote on the bill later this month. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7645191.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />In July,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6134732.stm">Elizabeth Manningham-Buller</a> [BBC profile], who resigned as the head of <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] last year, also <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-terrorism-detention-bill-criticized.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the bill, saying it was unworkable and would not afford defendants the necessary right to a fair trial, during a House of Lords <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80708-0002.htm#08070843000002">debate</a> [transcript; Liberty UK <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2008/peers-to-begin-opposition-to-42-day-pre-charge-detention-plans.shtml">backgrounder</a>]. Currently, British law authorizes <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-uk-government-loses.php">detention of terrorism suspects without charge for 28 days</a> [JURIST report]. Proponents of the new bill have argued that the 28-day time limit endangers national security. <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12037.asp">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4045210.ece">argued for the necessity of the bill</a> [<em>Times</em> column] and told MPs that it is the <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/02.htm#hddr_3">government&#39;s duty</a> [PMQ transcript] to provide such security. In June, the House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-commons-approves-42-day-terrorism.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report], but the House of Lords must still approve it for it to become law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Millions of Americans have been effectively disenfranchised because of criminal convictions, according to a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/exoffenders/36992pub20081001.html">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/exoffenders/37003prs20081001.html">press release</a>] released Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> [academic website]. The report found that state and county election officials receive little or no training regarding the applicable laws, resulting in widespread misunderstanding. It continued: <blockquote>De facto disenfranchisement has devastating long-term effects in communities across the country. Once a single local election official misinforms a citizen that he is not eligible to vote because of a past conviction, it is unlikely that citizen will ever follow up or make a second inquiry. Without further public education or outreach, the citizen will mistakenly believe that he is ineligible to vote for years, decades, or maybe the rest of his life. And that same citizen may pass along that same inaccurate information to his peers, family members and neighbors, creating a lasting ripple of de facto disenfranchisement across his community. </blockquote>Another ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/exoffenders/36998pub20081001.html">report</a> [text] released Wednesday found that voter registration forms across the country inadequately explain the voting eligibility of ex-convicts. McClatchy Newspapers has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/709559.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Even prisoners may vote in Maine and Vermont, while Kentucky and Virginia permanently revoke felons&#39; voting rights. Elsewhere, the ACLU-Brennan Center report noted, &quot;varied state laws form[] a patchwork across the country.&quot; The ACLU&#39;s <a href="http://www.aclu.org/votingrights/">Voting Rights Project</a> [advocacy website] is active in securing voting rights for ex-felons. In July, the ACLU filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file306_36053.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-challenges-alabama-felony.php">report</a>] challenging a provision of the Alabama Constitution that prevents felons convicted of &quot;crimes of moral turpitude&quot; from voting. In February, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu-tn.org/pdfs/Complaint_FelonVote.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/aclu-challenges-tennessee-voting-rights.php">report</a>] in federal court challenging a Tennessee law that requires convicted felons to pay &quot;all outstanding legal financial obligations&quot; before their voting rights are restored.

The decision that the killing was political allows for the &quot;rehabilitation&quot; or formal recognition of the Tsar&#39;s former rule. The ruling was praised by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which canonized Nicholas and his family in 2000. Some Communist Party leaders criticized the ruling, calling it a rewrite of history.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/">Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/67DC3BDFA5E688FD852574D4006EBE5C">lawsuit</a> [press release] Wednesday against <a href="http://www.merck.com/">Merck &amp; Co.</a> [corporate website] in support of state agencies that were harmed by Merck&#39;s allegedly deceptive marketing campaign promoting its prescription painkiller <a href="/currentawareness/vioxx.php">Vioxx</a> [JURIST news archive].   The lawsuit filed in the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/CASES/Case.htm">US District Court of the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] claims that Merck&#39;s marketing campaign was used to not only show the drug was safe but also to persuade customers to demand the drug, which is an non-steroid anti-inflammatory used to treat joint pain, from their health care professionals.  It is also alleged that Merck threatened physicians and researchers who questioned the drug&#39;s safety and that the company hid evidence of harmful effects of Vioxx. Florida is the eighth state to sue Merck over its marketing campaign.  AP has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/business/nation/story/709052.html">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa Bay Business Journal</span> has <a href="http://tampabay.bizjournals.com/tampabay/stories/2008/09/29/daily40.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Merck has been involved in a stream of Vioxx-related litigation during the last few years, including state and federal lawsuits in <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-jury-finds-merck-not-liable-in.php">Louisiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/jury-deadlock-in-california-vioxx-case.php">California</a>, and additional suits in <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/new-jersey-jury-awards-20-million-in.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/texas-appeals-court-overturns-jury.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports]. In September 2007, the New Jersey Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/new-jersey-supreme-court-decertifies.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit filed against Merck, reversing a lower court&#39;s decision to grant nationwide class certification in the case. In November 2007, Merck said that it had <a href="http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/corporate/2007_1109.html">agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle all pending lawsuits</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/merck-to-pay-485b-to-settle-all-pending.php">report</a>] regarding its marketing and distribution of Vioxx.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Under a <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/pub_media/1508_court_dress_pract_dir.pdf">new judicial dress code</a> [press release and text, PDF] that took effect Wednesday, civil and family judges in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/index.htm">Judiciary of England and Wales</a> [official website] will no longer wear wigs during court proceedings. The new dress code also features <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/publications_media/general/civilrobe_120508.htm">redesigned robes</a> [UK Judiciary press release], intended to give a more modern and grounded appearance to members of the judiciary. The dress reforms were instituted by the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers. The dress code, which was announced in July, affects only civil and family judges, and does not apply to criminal judges. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7644034.stm">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE4902F720081001?sp=true">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The reforms came following a four-year debate surrounding the findings of a <A HREF="http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/Court-working-dress-in-England-and-Wales.pdf">2004 report</A> [text, PDF] which found that the public preferred modernization of the judiciary working dress, which a majority of the judiciary opposed. Judiciary members argued that the traditional dress is well-suited for judicial functions because it is &quot;authoritative, traditional and distinguishes the wearer.&quot; Other court professionals also argued that &quot;lay members of the public are ill placed to advise on dress&quot; as they have no direct experience in legal proceedings.

In an interview with Serbian television channel <a href="http://www.rts.rs/page/home/ci.html">RTS</a> [official website], Tadic said that the option is &quot;not off the table.&quot; Alexander Ivanko, the Director of Public Information for the <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/">UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) [official website], <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/dpi/transcripts.nsf/0/F79A25AE1D11B50DC12574D50044BC9E/$FILE/tr011008.pdf">responded</a> [transcript, PDF] to Tadic&#39;s comments at a press conference on Wednesday: <blockquote>Our position has always been very, very clear, and it is not only our position, it is the Contact Group position, and as far as we are concerned, there should not be partition of Kosovo, period. I do not see anything else to discuss about this issue.</blockquote> Tadic&#39;s comments regarding the possible partitioning of Kosovo came as a number of European countries, including <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3682699,00.html">Germany</a> [Deutche Welle report], consider possible support for <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/serbia-president-asks-un-general.php">Serbia&#39;s request</a> [JURIST report] for an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling on the legality of Kosovo&#39;s independence.<br /><br />Kosovo&#39;s <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect this summer</a> [JURIST report] despite Serbia&#39;s argument that the charter of the breakaway province was legally void.

Serbia&#39;s official stance is that Kosovo is in violation of the UN Charter and <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=S/RES/1244%20(1999)&Lang=E&Area=UNDOC">UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> [PDF text], which reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Serbian state. The new state of Kosovo has been recognized by the US and most European states, but not by Russia, Serbia&#39;s closest ally.

In the court&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-343.pdf">modified opinion</a> [PDF text] released Wednesday, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in a footnote: <blockquote>When issued and announced on June 25, 2008, the Court&#39;s decision neither noted nor discussed the military penalty for rape under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. ... In a petition for rehearing respondent argues that the military penalty bears on our consideration of the question in this case. For the reasons set forth in the [forthcoming] statement respecting the denial of rehearing ... we find that the military penalty does not affect our reasoning or conclusions. </blockquote> In its original decision in the case, the Court had incorrectly noted that there were no federal laws allowing capital punishment for rape. The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] later <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-admits-overlooking-military-law-in.php">acknowledged</a> [JURIST report] that it had mistakenly failed to include in its brief the existence of a <a href="http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/PL109-163.pdf">military law</a> [PDF text] allowing the death penalty for child rape. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iiEniqpAKUX1RKGGD9edZH_WHkYwD93HQ8C00">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/washington/02scotus.html?ref=us">additional coverage</a>. From New Orleans, the <em>Times-Picayune</em> has <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/us_supreme_court_will_not_revi.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Ruling on the <u>Kennedy</u> case in June, a five-member majority of the Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-343.ZO.html">held</a> [opinion text; dissent <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-343.ZD.html">text</a>] that the death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment when imposed for a crime in which the victim was not killed. Patrick Kennedy was sentenced to death in Louisiana for raping a minor, one of the few remaining crimes where the death of a victim is not required for the death penalty. The Court found that in cases where the victim was not killed, the death penalty fails to serve &quot;deterrent or retributive&quot; purposes invoked for its use. The decision reversed and remanded a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-343_ob.pdf">holding</a> [PDF text] by the Supreme Court of Louisiana.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/">US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a> (CMS) [official website] on Wednesday implemented <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2007/07-3820.htm">regulations</a> [text, PDF] denying hospitals payment for treating conditions caused by some common <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/errback.htm">medical errors</a> [HHS backgrounder]. Those regulations, <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=2335&intNumPerPage=10&checkDate=&checkKey=&srchType=1&numDays=3500&srchOpt=0&srchData=&keywordType=All&chkNewsType=1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5&intPage=&showAll=&pYear=&year=&desc=false&cboOrder=date">announced</a> [CMS press release] last year, contain a so-called &quot;never list&quot; of preventable conditions for which hospitals may bill neither Medicare nor patients, including certain hospital-acquired infections, bedsores and complications from incorrect blood transfusions. The <a href="http://www.hospitalinfection.org/">Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths</a> [advocacy group] was among the organizations <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/rid-applauds-medicares-new-payment/story.aspx?guid={4CA308EA-C1F0-4FA7-9693-678280769E7B}&dist=hppr">welcoming the new regulations</a> [press release] on Wednesday, but it noted that many state health care programs lack similar rules. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/us/01mistakes.html?ref=health">more</a>.<br /><br />The new regulations were authorized by the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ171.109">Deficit Reduction Act of 2005</a> [text], which directed the US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS), which oversees Medicare, to identify reasonably preventable conditions that result in high-cost or high-volume treatment and additional government payments. CMS noted in the regulations that it selected only &quot;conditions where, if hospital personnel are engaging in good medical practice, the additional costs of the hospital-acquired condition will, in most cases, be avoided.&quot; An influential <a href="http://books.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=9738#toc">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=9728">press release</a>] issued by the <a href="http://www.iom.edu/">Institute of Medicine</a> [organization website] in 1999 found that preventable medical errors result in as many as 98,000 deaths each year and cost the United States as much as $29 billion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US district judge on Tuesday <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/08-03443.PDF">refused to dismiss</a> [decision and order, PDF] a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9515/#5">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) and the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9515/#1">Palestinian Authority</a> (PA) [CFR backgrounders] seeking damages for the injuries and deaths of US citizens in attacks in Israel. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2854">District Judge George B. Daniels</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of New York</a> [official website] rejected defense arguments that the Palestinian groups could not be sued under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002331----000-.html">Antiterrorism Act of 1991</a> (ATA) [text], which grants civil remedies to US citizens injured by acts of international terrorism. The defendants unsuccessfully argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in the case, that an Israeli court would be a more appropriate forum, and that they were entitled to immunity under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001602----000-.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> [text; US State Department <a href="http://travel.state.gov/law/info/judicial/judicial_693.html">backgrounder</a>]. The defendants also contended that the attacks were acts of war, for which the ATA does not provide remedies. Rejecting that defense, Daniels wrote: <blockquote>There has been no showing that the situs of the attacks were in any combat or militarized zone, or were otherwise targeted at military or governmental personnel or interests. Rather, plaintiffs allege that the attacks were intentionally targeted at the civilian population. They were purportedly carried out at locations where non-combatants citizens would be known to congregate, such as in the cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus and on a commercial passenger bus. Additionally, the use of bombs, under such circumstances, is indicative of an intent to cause far-reaching devastation upon the masses.... Such claimed violent attacks upon non-combatant civilians, who were allegedly simply going about their everyday lives, do not constitute acts of war for purposes of the ATA. </blockquote>Daniels did not rule on a defense motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, instead ordering limited discovery regarding that issue. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gcbB_pT2zbwEX1MGaU_dN8RLMsqAD93H90H80">more</a>. <br /><br />The <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-nysdce/case_no-1:2004cv00397/case_id-242881/">lawsuit</a> [case materials] seeks $3 billion in damages resulting from seven attacks that occurred from 2001 to 2004. In June, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757273.stm">Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad</a> [BBC profile] said the PA would <a href="http://www.nysun.com/new-york/palestinian-authority-may-defend-itself-in-ny/80553/">defend itself</a> [New York <em>Sun</em> report] in US cases in which plaintiffs had obtained default judgments. In another New York case, a federal district judge set aside a default judgment of more than $190 million against the PA but required it to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/nyregion/08plo.html">post a bond</a> [<em>New York Times</em> report] in the same amount to pay damages if found liable in subsequent proceedings. Earlier this year, the US State Department <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmafp/is_200802/ai_n24365311">declined seek dismissal</a> [AFP report] of US lawsuits against the PA after a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/11/AR2008021102627.html">request</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] to do so by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. In 2007, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice encouraged the Palestinians to &quot;respond to U.S. legal proceedings in a good faith and a timely manner.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Canadian <a href="http://www.mpcc-cppm.gc.ca/">Military Police Complaints Commission</a> (MPCC) [official website] <a href="http://www.mpcc-cppm.gc.ca/300/afghan2/2008.09.30_f.pdf">decided</a> [PDF text] Tuesday to move forward with a public hearing investigating the country&#39;s military detainee transfer process in Afghanistan despite a move from the <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/index.html">Canadian Department of Justice</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/canada-justice-department-moves-to.php">block the inquiry</a> [JURIST report]. MPCC Chair Peter A. Tinsley, issuing the decision pursuant to the <a href="http://canlii.ca/ca/sta/n-5/sec250.38.html">National Defence Act</a> [250.38 text], rejected the government&#39;s arguments that the MPCC&#39;s reach is limited to military policing issues and thus lacks jurisdiction to conduct the investigations that involve military operational decisions regarding detainee treatment: <blockquote>I find, based on principles of statutory interpretation, that the Complaints Commission has jurisdiction over the second Detainee Complaint pursuant to section 250.18(1) of the National Defence Act and section 2 of the Complaints About the Conduct of Members of the Military Police Regulations (the &#8220;Conduct Regulations&#8221;). The allegations relate to the policing duties and functions of the military police, which includes &#8220;custody&#8221;. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the provisions establishing the Complaints Commission, which is to provide independent oversight of the conduct of members of the military police when engaged in policing duties or functions. The Attorney General&#39;s interpretation, if accepted, would significantly restrict, and perhaps eliminate, the scope of review by the Complaints Commission of essentially all military police conduct, without regard to the clear language and purpose of the Act. This is not consistent with the legislative purpose of the Act.</blockquote> Tinsley also cited the &quot;threat to public confidence in the military police&quot; as a public interest justification for the hearings. MPCC spokespersons said that interviews in connection with the inquiry will begin immediately, with the hearings tentatively scheduled for December. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Ottawa Citizen</span> has <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=beda6bd9-f143-4aa1-bae9-2c14babeb162">more</a>. <br /><br />The investigation began in February 2007 as <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/">Amnesty International Canada</a> and the <a href="http://www.bccla.org/">British Columbia Civil Liberties Association</a> [advocacy websites] filed complaints against the <a href="http://www.vcds.forces.gc.ca/cfpm/intro_e.asp">Canadian Forces Provost Marshal</a> [official website], alleging complicity in torture by Canadian personnel serving in Afghanistan as part of the <a href="http://www.nato.int/isaf/index.html">NATO International Security Assistance Force</a> [official website]. The MPCC opened its own investigation, and in March <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/afghan-detainees-have-no-rights-under.php">announced public hearings</a> [JURIST report] to issue subpoenas and compel disclosure, saying that it was unable to complete its investigation because several departments in the Canadian government were refusing to hand over key information. In April, the Canadian Department of Justice filed papers in Canada&#39;s <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court</a> [official website] to contest the MPCC&#39;s jurisdiction to hold the hearings. No decision has yet been rendered.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/09/30/1827_type82912type82913_207060.shtml">pushed for</a> [speech text] the adoption of sweeping anti-graft <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/corruption.shtml">legislation</a> [plan materials] while opening the first meeting of the newly-established <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-signs-decree-to.php">Anti-Corruption Council</a> [JURIST report].  Deflecting rumors that the legislation had stalled after the Russian <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/world/europe/10georgia.html?_r=1&ref=europe&oref=slogin">conflict with Georgia</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">conflict news archive</a>], Medvedev described the urgency of the situation: <blockquote>Corruption in our country has taken on not only massive dimensions and occurs on a massive scale, it has also become commonplace and routine &#8211; something that characterizes the lives of our citizens. And as you know, it is not banal bribes &#8211; regardless of their size &#8211; that I am referring to, but rather a serious illness which affects our economy and corrupts all of society.  In this regard fundamentally lowering the level of corruption is, of course, a strategic challenge facing our country. The achievement of this goal is directly connected with the protection of property rights in Russia, strengthening the legal and judicial systems, and the expansion of free enterprise.</blockquote>  Medvedev called for clarity and certainty in drafting the final version of the package, which consists of a central bill and amendments to 25 current laws, as well as secondary legislation, organizational measures, and training programs.  Among the proposed amendments is a measure that would require state and municipal employees and their family members to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080930/117342210.html">disclose their income, property and assets</a> [RIA Novosti report].  If approved by the Anti-Corruption Council, Medvedev will present the package to members of the Russian lower house of parliament, the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], over the next two days.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> has <a href="http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/371358.htm">local coverage</a>.  <br /><br />Medvedev vowed to clean up corruption in his May <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">inauguration speech</a> [JURIST report] and has made judicial reform and independence a priority of his administration.  Corruption is a long-standing problem in Russia, where in 2006 bribes totaling $240 billion were reportedly accepted by corrupt officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Philip M. Pro of the US <a href="http://www.nvd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Nevada</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/pdf/nevadaorder.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday granting a plaintiffs&#39; motion for summary judgment and invalidating Nevada&#39;s so-called <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-295.html#NRS295Sec012">County Population Rule</a> [NRS 295.012 text] as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. The order stems from a <a href="http://media.lasvegassun.com/media/pdfs/blogs/documents/2008/02/15/00003979.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] filed by the <a href="http://www.mpp.org/">Marijuana Policy Project</a> (MPP) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.aclunv.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada</a> (ACLU-NV) [advocacy website] challenging a Nevada law known as the County Population Rule, which required petitions for ballot initiatives to amend the <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Const/NVConst.html">Nevada Constitution</a> [text] be signed by a number of registered voters from each county equal to ten percent of the voters who voted in the entire state at the last preceding general election. The lawsuit alleged that the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution by favoring residents of sparsely populated counties over residents of heavily populated counties. Using the strict scrutiny test developed by the Supreme Court for Equal Protection Clause analysis, Judge Pro wrote:<blockquote>Because Defendants do not meet their burden of showing the County Population Rule is narrowly tailored to serve its interests and the Rule violates one person, one vote, no genuine issue of material fact exists that the County Population rule violates the Equal Protection Clause. The Court will therefor grant Plaintiffs&#39; Motion for Summary Judgment ... Further, the Court declares the County Population Rule in Nevada Revised Statute [Section] 295.012 unconstitutional and enjoins Defendant [Nevada Secretary of State Ross] Miller from enforcing the County Population Rule.</blockquote> The <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em> has <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/news/29929004.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s order invalidating the County Population Rule comes after a similar law was found unconstitutional in 2005 after a challenge by the ACLU-NV. In a press release, MPP director of state campaigns Neal Levine <a href="http://www.mpp.org/news/press-releases/nv/federal-court-throws-out.html">urged Nevada not to appeal the decision</a> [MPP press release] saying &quot;This is now the second time we&#39;ve defeated the state on the exact same issue. How many more times do you think it&#39;s going to take before they stop passing unconstitutional initiative laws?&quot; The ACLU-NV also released a press release characterizing the order as a <a href="http://www.aclunv.org/initiative-petition-rules">victory</a> [ACLU-NV press release] that was necessary to &quot;protect the right of the people to access the initiative process.&quot;

In a <a href="http://www.cba.org/cba/news/pdf/2008-09-30_khadr.pdf">statement</a> [PDF text] made during a joint press conference Tuesday, a CBA spokeswoman said:<blockquote>[We] issue this call to the Government of Canada to take appropriate steps with the United States to have Omar Khadr sent back to Canada. We at the CBA share the ASF&#39;s conviction that the case of Mr. Khadr, who has been detained by the American authorities since he was 15 years old, should be dealt with in Canada by competent, independent and impartial authorities. We also urge all the federal political parties to speak out in favour of Mr. Khadr&#39;s return to Canada, and to specify the steps they would take to achieve his repatriation as soon as possible.</blockquote>Last August, the CBA put pressure on Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/canada-lawyers-urge-pm-to-work-for-omar.php">&quot;negotiate&quot; with the US government</a> [JURIST report] for Khadr&#39;s immediate release. In May, leaders of 34 international bar associations and law societies, including the CBA, <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/international-bar-associations-call-for.php">called for the &quot;immediate closure&quot; of the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report], and specifically for Khadr&#39;s repatriation. The Canadian Press has <a href="http://www.cfrb.com/news/14/799679">more</a>.<br /><br />Khadr, who has now spent almost six years without trial in Guantanamo, faces possible life imprisonment on crimes allegedly committed at the age of 15 while fighting with the Taliban in <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and spying. He is one of a <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">small group</a> [DOD materials] of Guantanamo detainees facing prosecution under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF]. His trial is currently slated to begin November 10.

In July, four former detainees at Iraq&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive] filed <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-files-four-new-abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuits-targeting-military-contractor">lawsuits</a> [CCR materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ex-abu-ghraib-detainees-sue-military.php">report</a>] against CACI and <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/">L-3 Communications</a> [corporate website], which performed interrogation and interpretation work for the US military, alleging that they violated the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Geneva Convention</a>, the <a href="http://www.army.mil/fm1/">Army Field Manual</a> [texts] and US law by torturing and conspiring to torture the detainees. They further alleged that CACI and L-3 negligently failed to prevent the torture. In a <a href="/pdf/cacibrief.pdf">motion to stay discovery</a> [text, PDF] filed last week in US <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], CACI&#39;s lawyers argued that the company is <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/77/77.F3d.1442.94-1307.html">protected by derivative absolute immunity</a> [<u>Mangold v. Analytic Services, Inc.</u> text] because its work was ordered by the government: <blockquote>[T]he CACI Defendants will assert a defense of absolute official immunity in a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint in this action. That motion will be filed shortly after the filing of the present motion. As a matter of binding Circuit precedent, this Court may not permit Plaintiffs to take discovery prior to the Court&#8217;s resolution of the CACI Defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss based on derivative absolute official immunity.</blockquote> A hearing on the motions is scheduled for Friday. AP has <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008206321_apmdabughraiblawsuits1stldwritethru.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The actions brought in July followed a similar <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/abu-ghraib-ex-detainee-files-torture.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] filed in May by an ex-detainee who alleged that the contractors engaged in torture and conspiracy at the prison. Last year, US District Judge James Robertson <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv1165-137">refused to dismiss</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-judge-rules-abu-ghraib-abuse-lawsuit.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/saleh-v.-titan">class action lawsuit</a> [CCR materials] against CACI in which an <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/Saleh_FourthAmendedComplaint_12_07.pdf">amended complaint</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-lawsuit-claims-us-contractor.php">report</a>] alleged that CACI was responsible for the torture of more than 250 former detainees held in Iraqi prisons. Earlier this month, lawyers for CACI <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/9.11.08%20CACIs%20Reply%20Brief%2008-7001_16.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that judges for the US District Court for the District of Columbia should grant CACI summary judgment in that case because the company agents acted under exclusive military control.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate voted Wednesday to approve <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h7081eh.txt.pdf">legislation</a> [HR 7081 text, PDF] establishing a cooperative nuclear energy agreement with India. The bill, entitled the &quot;United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act,&quot; was approved by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00211">86-13</a> [roll call vote], and now heads to the White House for signature. The agreement is an important step for India, and ends a nearly 30-year US ban on nuclear trade with India. India is not a signatory to the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT) [text, PDF], and has developed a nuclear energy infrastructure and weapons systems. The agreement will allow US businesses to sell nuclear technology, supplies and services to India, and also subjects Indian civilian nuclear reactors to inspection by the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website]. The <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/">Arms Control Association</a> (ACA) [advocacy website], called the deal &quot;<a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/node/3363">unprecedented and imprudent</a>&quot; [ACA press statement], characterizing it as &quot;a nonproliferation disaster,&quot; and itemizing its objections:<blockquote>Contrary to the counterfactual claims of proponents and apologists, it does not bring India into the &#8220;nonproliferation mainstream&#8221; and India&#8217;s so-called separation plan is not credible from a nonproliferation perspective:<br />-    U.S. and foreign nuclear fuel supplies to India&#8217;s civil nuclear sector would free up scarce domestic supplies for exclusive use for weapons production. This could allow India to increase its bomb production rate and accelerate Pakistan&#8217;s bomb production;<br />-    The agreement fails to prohibit India from extracting tritium (a radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear bombs) for weapons from its &#8220;safeguarded&#8221; power reactors;<br />-    As reported in the Sept. 18 edition of The Washington Post, India&#8217;s nuclear technology procurement practices do not conform with those of responsible nuclear suppliers and they risk the leakage of sensitive information;<br />-     India&#39;s civil-military separation plan would allow the free flow of personnel and information between safeguarded and unsafeguarded faciliites [sic];<br />-    Unlike the United States and other nuclear weapon-states, India has refused to sign the CTBT and halt the production of nuclear bomb material. The opposition BJP may not respect the current Indian government&#8217;s nuclear test moratorium pledge.</blockquote> In a <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/10/110554.htm">statement</a> [text], <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/41252.htm">Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice</a> [official profile] applauded the Congressional approval of the agreement. Reuters has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idINIndia-35765320081002?sp=true">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7647689.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In August, US Rep. Howard Berman (D-CA), the Chairman of the House <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [committee website], urged Secretary Rice to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-congressman-urges-rice-to-postpone.php">postpone the US-India nuclear deal</a> [JURIST report] until requiring India to provide permanent security for nuclear facilities and stop nuclear weapons testing. The US and other nuclear powers have become increasingly accepting of India&#39;s nuclear program, but in May they cited Iran&#39;s program as a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nuclear-powers-say-iran-threatening.php">major threat to the goals of the NPT</a> [JURIST report] in a <a href="http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/delegates%20statements/P5%20Statement.pdf">joint statement</a> [text, PDF] issued at the end of a <a href="http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/index.html">two-week meeting</a> [official website] of 106 NPT member nations. The countries urged Iran, currently under <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/security-council-broadens-iran-nuclear.php">UN sanctions</a> for its nuclear program, to <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-rejects-un-call-to-cease-nuclear.php">accept an incentive package</a> [JURIST reports] in exchange for abandoning uranium enrichment. That statement also addressed the nuclear situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=north+korea+nuclear">North Korea</a> [JURIST news archive], which opted out of the treaty in 2003 to restart disarmament negotiations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nine US states and the Canadian province of Manitoba sued the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> [official website] Thursday, alleging that an agency <a href="http://www.epa.gov/npdes/regulations/water_transfers_finalrule.pdf">regulation</a> [PDF text] allows the discharge of polluted water in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/ch26.html">Clean Water Act</a> [text; EPA <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/lcwa.html">materials</a>]. In a complaint <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2008/oct/oct2b_08.html">filed</a> [NY AG press release] in US <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], the state attorneys general assert that the Water Transfer Rule promulgated in June exempts transfers from one body of water to another without an intervening use from permitting requirements under the <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/home.cfm?program_id=41">National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</a> (NPDES) [EPA backgrounder]. Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/PressRelease/081002USEPA.asp">said</a> [press release] the regulation &quot;jeopardize[s] both our economy and our fishing, boating, and outdoors way of life by allowing polluted water to be diverted into Minnesota lakes and rivers.&quot; The attorneys generals&#39; complaint claims that the regulation exceeds the EPA&#39;s statutory authority and is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=a3r61g41LWUk&refer=canada">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/sixth-circuit-rules-on-challenge-to-epa.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on a suit brought by several environmental groups seeking to compel the EPA to implement antidegradation requirements for Kentucky under the Clean Water Act. The court <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0333p-06.pdf">affirmed summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the EPA on some issues, reversed it on others and remanded the matter to the EPA. <br /><br />The EPA has been sued in recent months by a number of states seeking either the promulgation of regulations or effective response to petitions. In August, 12 states <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/aug/aug25b_08.html">filed suit</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/states-sue-epa-over-clean-air-act.php">report</a>] against the EPA for its alleged failure to enforce provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85.html">Clean Air Act</a> [text; EPA <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/oaq_caa.html/">materials</a>] requiring oil refineries to adopt measures curbing the pollution contributing to global warming. In July, California Attorney General <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] formally <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1594_final_180_day_notice.pdf">notified</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1594">press release</a>] the EPA that the state had petitioned the EPA three times seeking a regulatory ruling and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/california-threatens-to-sue-epa-over.php">would file a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the agency if it refused to issue rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from various vehicles and types of machinery.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST news archive] last Friday <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/139/C33_I_7_EN.pdf">ended</a> [decision, PDF] the segregation of five defendants currently in pretrial detention.  The decision, released to the public on Wednesday, was a response to an appeal filed by defendant <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/cambodia/diary10.html">Nuon Chea</a> [PBS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nuon+Chea">news archive</a>], who argued that the prison conditions were too restrictive.  In May 2008, the Pre-Trial Chamber approved the &#8220;strict separation between the detainees,&#8221; taking away &#8220;the right to communicate among themselves.&#8221;  The judges at that time relied on ECCC <a href="www.cambodia.gov.kh/krt/internal_rules/ECCC_Draft-Internal-Rules.pdf">Internal Rule 55</a> [text, PDF], which gives judges the jurisdiction to limit contact between the detainees in the interest of the investigation.  They also cited the <a href="www.icc-cpi.int/ ">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=icc">news archive</a>] holding in <span style="font-style:italic;">Prosecutor v. Katanga and Chui</span>, where the ICC ruled:<blockquote>[Measures] to restrict the communication and the contact...constitute an important restriction of the rights provided for by the detention regime set forth in the Regulations and the RoR [Regulations of the Registry], and therefore they can be imposed if the requirements of necessity and proportionality are met.</blockquote> In overturning the segregation order, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that the &#8220;potential for prejudicial collusion&#8221; was now negligible, and &#8220;that there can be no reason related to investigation purposes justifying that contacts between [Chea and the four others] be restricted.&#8221; The <span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> has <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2008100221921/National-news/KRT-to-let-detainees-converse.html">more</a>. <br /><br />The ECCC was established by <a href="www.eccc.gov.kh%2Fenglish%2Fcabinet%2Flaw%2F4%2FKR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf">law</a> [text as amended 2004, PDF] in 2001 to investigate and try surviving Khmer Rouge officials. The Khmer Rouge is generally believed to be responsible for the genocide of an <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] between 1975 and 1979. No top Khmer Rouge officials have yet faced trial. In August 2007, the ECCC brought its first charges against <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Khek Iev</a> [TrialWatch profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/indicted-ex-khmer-rouge-leader-willing.php">report</a>], who was in charge of the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/">United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/dpi/pressrelease.nsf/0/7DECCDA51DB11BE2C12574D70049E600/$FILE/pr1740.pdf">reopened its courthouse</a> [press release] in Kosovo&#39;s northern city of Mitrovica. The courts were closed after being <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kosovo-serbs-take-over-un-courthouse-in.php">taken over by Serbian protesters</a> [JURIST report] in March as part of an ethnic conflict with Kosovar Albanians. The mission has said that only vital criminal court functions will be immediately resumed and UNMIK head <a href="http://un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sga1139.doc.htm">Lamberto Zannier</a> [appointment release] expressed guarded optimism on the future of the courts:<blockquote> The reopening of the court in north Mitrovica is a first step to ensure that rule of law is provided to everyone in Kosovo. I am pleased that Belgrade and Pristina are supporting this pragmatic development, which is in everyone&#8217;s interest... However, a court &#8211; like all rule of law institutions &#8211; does not stand in a vacuum. The Court&#8217;s success will require continued constructive actions by all sides and the support of the communities that it serves.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gQS7MXzKrXSGppV0e8-KuBp_RIkwD93J1SF02">more</a>. The UN Press Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28423&Cr=UNMIK&Cr1=">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In May, the Steering Council of the Kosovo Judges&#39; Association said courts in Kosovo&#39;s northern districts had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/northern-kosovo-courts-in-legal-limbo.php">left in legal limbo</a> [JURIST report] since the Assembly of Kosovo&#39;s February <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/?krye=news&newsid=1635&lang=en">unilateral declaration of Kosovo&#39;s independence</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">report</a>] from Serbia. The Council expressed concern that courts in the region were unable to guarantee the protection of peoples&#39; legal rights, a situation that could lead to the violation of Article 6 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Fundamental Rights of and Freedoms</a> [text]. Kosovo&#39;s new <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in June despite a declaration by Serbian President Boris Tadic that the charter of the breakaway Serbian province was legally void.

The main suspect, Rustam Makhmudov, also from Chechnya, has yet to be captured but Russian authorities have said he is hiding in Western Europe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA1LTQxODYtY3Jfb3BuLnBkZg==/05-4186-cr_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irlce6e/3/hilite">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the convictions of Yemeni cleric <a href="http://almoayad-zayed.net/view_enews.asp?sub_no=406_2006_11_21_50190">Sheikh Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad and assistant, Mohammed Zayed </a>[advocacy website], also from Yemen, because of evidentiary errors that were prejudicial to the extent that they deprived the defendants of a fair trial. Al-Moayad and Zayed had been <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/yemeni-sheik-convicted-in-long-running.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in March 2005 on charges that they lead a terror-funding network based in Brooklyn, NY. At their convictions, both maintained that additional evidence on government surveillance recordings would have showed they were not guilty. During their appeal, Al-Moayad and Zayed argued that they had been entrapped by government informants and presented character witnesses who said neither of the two condoned violence and that they had spoken out against terrorist acts. In support of its ruling the appeals court said:<blockquote>We believe that, in the aggregate, the district court&#8217;s errors deprived the defendants of a fair trial. The district court&#8217;s cumulated errors in admitting Al-Anssi&#8217;s notes and the testimony of Gideon Black and Yahya Goba &#8220;cast such a serious doubt on the fairness of the trial&#8221; as to warrant reversal of the defendants&#8217; convictions.

Al-Moayad and Zayed were arrested in Germany in 2003 after telling a federal agent posing as a US businessman that they would help him funnel money to militants. Al-Moayad was later extradited to the United States where he was acquitted of actually funding al-Qaeda, but was found guilty of providing material support and resources to Hamas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi Presidency Council on Friday signed a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+provincial">provincial elections bill</a> [JURIST news archive] allowing for voting in most of the country early next year. The final version did not include a controversial clause that <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/sga1091.doc.htm">Staffan de Mistura</a> [appointment release], the UN special representative to Iraq, had <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28397&Cr=Iraq&Cr1=">urged Iraqi lawmakers to reintroduce</a> [UN News Centre and BBC News <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7649196.stm">reports</a>]. That clause, which would guarantee legislative seats to religious minorities, was removed from the bill because of uncertainty on how to determine the number of seats to be set aside for the groups. De Mistura expressed disappointment at the removal, saying the clause had been a &quot;strong indication Iraq is a nation ready to protect the political rights of minorities as founded in the Constitution.&quot; Earlier this week, Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+maliki">news archive</a>] also <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-pm-calls-for-minority-seat.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the inclusion of the representation guarantee, saying it would help assuage minority fears of oppression. The bill can be amended before elections are held. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jmCIE2FFs11op0y2IsDmholhQZQw">more</a>.<br /><br />The provincial elections bill was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-parliament-approves-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] last week. The parliament debated the elections bill for months, with a main point of disagreement being over provisions relating to the ethnically-diverse <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity.org backgrounder] region in the north of the country. After <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-parliament-fails-to-approve-power.php">several failures</a> [JURIST report], the parliament accepted a UN-proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080924-5.html">compromise</a> [White House press release] allowing elections in the rest of the country to proceed, as former opponents of the plan said they were confident an agreement could be reached to carry out elections in Kirkuk. Earlier this month, Iraqi lawmakers agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iraq-lawmakers-divide-control-of-kirkuk.php">temporarily divide control of Kirkuk</a> [JURIST report] among the city&#39;s ethnic groups until a permanent governing plan is established.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Friday passed a $700 billion <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h1424eas.txt.pdf">financial rescue bill</a> [HR 1424 text, PDF] that President Bush quickly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122304922742602533.html">signed into law</a> [WSJ report]. The House approved the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 by a <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213">vote</a> [roll call] of 263-171 four days after it <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-rejects-financial-rescue-bill.php">defeated an earlier version</a> [JURIST report] of the bill. The final bill authorizes the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov">Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] to establish a Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions and to provide insurance and guarantees for any troubled asset originated before to March 14, 2008. &quot;Troubled assets&quot; are defined as residential or commercial mortgages or securities, obligations or other financial instruments based on or related to them. The legislation also gives <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html">Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson</a> [official profile] discretion to designate any other financial instrument a troubled asset, with the consent of Congress. After the House passed the bill, President Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081003-11.html">said</a> [statement text]: <blockquote>A major problem in our financial system is that banks have restricted the flow of credit to businesses and consumers; many of the assets these banks are holding have lost value. The legislation Congress passed today addresses this problem head on by providing a variety of new tools to the government - such as allowing us to purchase some of the troubled assets, and creating a new government insurance program that will guarantee the value of others. The bill also ensures that these new programs are carried out in a way that protects taxpayers. It prevents failed executives from receiving windfalls from taxpayers&#39; dollars. It establishes a bipartisan board to oversee the plan&#39;s implementation. </blockquote>The act establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Board to review Treasury actions taken under the legislation. While allowing courts to set aside actions that are &quot;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law,&quot; the legislation protects the Treasury secretary from any injunctions other than those to remedy constitutional violations. It provides for expedited review of requests for restraining orders or injunctions and automatically stays any equitable relief issued against Treasury secretary for actions pursuant to certain provisions. The act also temporarily increases the amount of deposit insurance provided by the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC) [official website] from $100,000 to $250,000. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/business/economy/04bailout.html">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/03/AR2008100301108.html">additional coverage</a>. <br /><br />After the original bill failed in the House, the Senate on Wednesday <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213">approved</a> [roll call] a version that incorporated a number of &quot;sweeteners&quot; to make the legislation more palatable to Democratic and Republican representatives who had opposed it. Among these additions are: <ul><li>the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which the Senate initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/congress-passes-mental-health-parity.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] last week.<br /><li>extensions of a number of tax credits and incentives, including the renewable energy tax Credit and the <a href="http://www.cdfifund.gov/what_we_do/programs_id.asp?programID=5">New Markets Tax Credit</a> [CDFI backgrounder].<br /><li>an extension of taxpayer relief from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc556.html">alternative minimum tax</a> [IRS backgrounder].<br /><li>emergency relief provisions for Americans affected by recent hurricanes and other natural disasters. </ul>Last week, Senate Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senate-democrats-fault-lack-of-judicial.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the Bush administration&#39;s proposed version of the legislation, which would have precluded judicial oversight of the asset purchases. Led by <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Christopher Dodd</a> (D-CT), chairman of the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/">Senate Banking Committee</a> [official websites], the Democrats put forth their own proposal that included the judicial review language. Some observers had expressed concern that the Bush proposal would represent an unconstitutional delegation of the spending powers granted to Congress by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html">Article I of the US Constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/about/blair.htm">Sir Ian Blair</a> [official profile] resigned Thursday from his position as Commissioner of London&#39;s <a href="http://www.met.police.uk/index.shtml">Metropolitan Police Service</a> (&quot;Met&quot;) [official website], effective December 1, 2008. Blair cited a strained relationship with the newly-elected mayor of London, <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/">Boris Johnson</a> [official profile], and the mayor&#39;s decision for new leadership at the Met as the leading factors in his decision to resign. In a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2008_10_02_sir_ian_blair.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/organisation/ministers/jacqui-smith/">Home Secretary Jacqui Smith</a> [official profile] thanked Blair for his leadership through the <a href="/currentawareness/london.php">July 7, 2005 London transit bombings</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a corresponding <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2008_10_02_boris_johnson.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Johnson, Smith indicated that the search for Blair&#39;s replacement would begin immediately. In a prepared <a href="http://cms.met.police.uk/news/major_operational_announcements/statement_from_commissioner_sir_ian_blair">statement</a> [text], Blair said:<blockquote> I am resigning in the best interests of the people of London and the Metropolitan Police Service. I would have wished to continue to serve Londoners until my term of office expired in February 2010. However, at a meeting yesterday, the new Mayor made clear, in a very pleasant but determined way, that he wished there to be a change of leadership at the Met. I understand that to serve effectively the commissioner must have the confidence of both the mayor and the home secretary. Without the mayor&#39;s backing, I do not consider that I can continue in the job. Personally I see no bar to working effectively with the new mayor, but it is there that we differ and hence I am unable to continue. The home secretary has asked that I should stay for enough time for the process of appointing my successor to be got under way. I will therefore leave office on December 1, 2008, giving the home secretary and Metropolitan Police Authority time to make plans for the appointment of my successor. I offer Boris Johnson and his team at City Hall and at the Police Authority the very best of fortune.</blockquote>BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7648664.stm">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/world/europe/03britain.html?ref=world">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Blair&#39;s three-year tenure as Commissioner of the Met was dominated by terrorism-related issues. He was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/uk-counter-terror-official-misled.php">cleared of any wrongdoing</a> [JURIST report] in the shooting of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5173032.stm">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> [BBC profile] in a London Tube station after he was mistakenly identified as a terrorist after a second and this time failed series of bombings in late July 2005, but his public reputation was sullied by the incident. Blair also advocated <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-police-chief-urges-review-of-terror.php">extending the current 28-day detention limit for uncharged terrorism suspects</a> [JURIST news archive], which soon may increase to 42 days if legislation now before Parliament is passed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] is preparing to implement a new <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/laws/gc_1222707499738.shtm">regulation</a> [text; <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1222704743103.shtm">fact sheet</a>] that relaxes restrictions on issuing US visas to HIV-positive visitors. The regulation allows HIV-positive foreigners seeking to visit the US to receive temporary, non-immigrant visas without undergoing an individualized waiver process. In <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/pr_1222705590290.shtm">announcing the change</a> [DHS press release], <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/biography_0116.shtm">Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile] said the regulation &quot;significantly improves the opportunities for individuals seeking to visit the US who were previously inadmissible because of an HIV infection&quot; while &quot;while maintaining a high level of security at our borders.&quot; The regulation will allow some HIV-positive applicants to receive visas within one day, rather than waiting an average of 18 days for processing. The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/02/MN87139JJV.DTL">more</a>.<br /><br />Thirteen nations ban the entry of most HIV-positive individuals, as the US has since 1987. In July, President Bush signed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h5501enr.txt.pdf">legislation</a> [PDF text; White House <a href="http://www.pepfar.gov/press/107735.htm">fact sheet</a>] reauthorizing the <a href="http://www.pepfar.gov/">President&#39;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) [official website] and removing a statutory restriction on issuing visas to HIV-positive foreigners. A Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/octqtr/pdf/42cfr34.2.pdf">regulation</a> [PDF text] continues to classify HIV as a <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=03337523cacf2110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=95fc9c997f710110VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD">&quot;communicable disease of public health significance&quot;</a> [USCIS backgrounder], making waivers necessary for HIV-positive visa applicants until this week&#39;s DHS action. The <a href="http://www.gmhc.org">Gay Men&#39;s Health Crisis</a> [advocacy website] and other groups have <a href="http://www.gmhc.org/about/releases/080730_hivban.html">called on HHS</a> [press release] to remove HIV from that classification.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian government accountability group <a href="http://www.dwatch.ca/">Democracy Watch</a> [advocacy website] brought a <a href="http://www.dwatch.ca/camp/MotionWrittenReps.pdf">lawsuit</a> [argument, PDF; <a href="http://www.dwatch.ca/camp/RelsOct0108.html">press release</a>] on Thursday, seeking to postpone the country&#39;s parliamentary elections scheduled for October 14. The group argues that the elections, proposed by <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official profile], would violate a <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&query=4544&List=toc&Session=14">2007 amendment</a> [Bill C-16 materials] to the Canada Elections Act.  Under the amendment, the next election would be held in October 2009.  The group argues that only a vote of no-confidence by Parliament can legitimately bring an early election, and that allowing the prime minister to schedule elections goes against the intent of the amendment. The group also argues that giving the prime minister such control would allow the ruling party to schedule elections during periods of popular support, and to prepare for elections before they are announced. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</font> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20081002.ELECTION02/TPStory/National">more</a>.

One of the justifications of the bill at the time was that it would prevent unfair manipulation of election dates by ruling parties.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court of appeals in The Hague on Thursday extended prison terms for four Dutch terror suspects <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/four-dutch-defendants-convicted-for.php">convicted in 2006</a> [JURIST report] for planning attacks against Dutch politicians and government facilities after finding them guilty of an additional charge of membership in a terrorist organization. The court agreed with evidence that they shared a single belief system and made concerted attempts to locate targeted Dutch politicians, including <a href="http://www.minister-raad.info/english/prime_minister/pm/index.html">Netherlands Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende</a> [official profile]. The original eight-year sentence for alleged ringleader Samir Azzouz was increased to nine years after the judges found that he &quot;made it apparent that he despises Dutch society&quot; and &quot;knows no compassion for the potential victims of the acts he planned.&quot; Co-defendants Mohammed Chentouf and Nouredine al Fatmi, convicted of aiding in preparation of the attacks, and Soumaya Sahla, who was found to have been an accomplice, also received increased prison terms. AP has <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&sid=1489667">more</a>.<br /><br />Azzouz has been arrested multiple times in the <a href="/countries/netherlands.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST news archive] and was acquitted in 2005 of <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-supreme.php#3">participating in a terrorist conspiracy</a> [JURIST report]. The acquittal was met with public outcry, and Dutch legislators adopted more <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/dutch-parliament-approves-anti.php">stringent anti-terror measures</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting membership in terrorist organizations and recruiting for such groups. Later in 2005, Azzouz was rearrested with his co-defendants for being in possession of a self-recorded suicide-bomber video, automatic weapons, ammunition, jihad training materials, and a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/16/news/dutch.php">list of home addresses for Dutch politicians</a> [AP report], including Balkenende.

Specialist Steven Ribordy, formerly a member of the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th Infantry</a> [unit website], testified at his court-martial that he stood at his post and watched as other members of his battalion carried out the killings, said to have been committed to avenge the January 2007 deaths of two US soldiers. As part of a plea agreement, Ribordy was sentenced to eight months in prison, a reduction from a term of up to five years. Ribordy will also receive a bad-conduct discharge with a reduced rank. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hYtcV7GUHRC88uGXnQ8Hl6I5lvbAD93ID6500">more</a>.

Last month, Specialist Belmor Ramos <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy.php">pleaded guilty to conspiracy</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement, admitting he willingly took part in the killings as retribution for the deaths of the US soldiers. Three other soldiers are awaiting hearings to determine sufficiency of evidence for courts-martial, but no date has been set.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=human+rights+watch">news archive</a>] Wednesday <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/eastafrica1008/">called on the Ethiopian government</a> [HRW materials] to release rendition victims in custody or prosecute them in an open court that meets basic fair trial standards. The renditions were the result of a US-backed Ethiopian military intervention in neighboring <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive] in late 2006 in support of efforts by Somalia&#39;s <a href="http://www.somali-gov.info/">Transitional Federal Government</a> [official website] to oust Islamist authorities from Mogadishu. The fighting caused thousands to flee across the border into Kenya, which detained at least 150 people from more than 18 countries. In early 2007, Kenyan authorities rendered dozens of these individuals suspected of terrorism back to Somalia, where they were handed over to the Ethiopian military and questioned by US and Ethiopian intelligence agents. The governments of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia have all denied illegally transporting and jailing people, claiming they have only taken action against legitimate suspects. According to Human Rights Watch, the rendition victims were denied access to their embassies, their families and international relief organizations. Former prisoners have complained of solitary confinement and accused Ethiopian authorities of torture, including the pulling out toenails, holding loaded guns to their heads, the crushing of genitals and being beaten to the point of unconsciousness. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7644989.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Human Rights Watch initially raised the west African renditions issue in March 2007 when it <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the US, Kenya, and Ethiopia were cooperating with the transitional government of Somalia to detain refugees from the recent conflict there. Canada, Sweden and Eritrea subsequently pressured <a href="/countries/ethiopia.php">Ethiopia</a> [JURIST news archive] to reveal details regarding foreign nationals it has allegedly detained in <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/us-intelligence-agents-using-secret.php">secret prisons run in collaboration with the FBI and CIA</a> [JURIST report]. In August last year Kenyan Muslims in Nairobi protested that suspects detained in Kenya had been flown on secret <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition flights</a> [JURIST news archive] to Ethiopia, where <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/us-intelligence-agents-using-secret.php">&quot;aggressive interrogation&quot; took place at the hands of Americans</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Polish leader <a href="http://www.wojciech-jaruzelski.pl/">General Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> [personal website; CNN <a href="http://www.wojciech-jaruzelski.pl/">profile</a>; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jaruzelski">news archive</a>] testified Thursday at the resumption of his trial that he had no choice but to <a href="http://www.poland.gov.pl/?document=366">impose martial law</a> [Polish government backgrounder] on Poland in 1981. Jaruzelski, who is charged with &quot;organizing crimes of a military nature,&quot; among other offenses, <a href="http://www.wbj.pl/article-42753-jaruzelski-presents-evidence-in-martial-law-trial.html?typ=wbj">read from a 200-page statement</a> [<em>Warsaw Business Journal</em> report]: <blockquote>I constantly state that martial law saved Poland from looming catastrophe. Martial law was evil, but it was a far lesser evil than what would have happened without it.... The hard decision was motivated by a higher necessity. </blockquote>Jaruzelski testified that he made the decision to prevent the Soviet government from taking action against Poland&#39;s pro-democracy <a href="http://www.solidarity.gov.pl/">Solidarity movement</a> [official website]. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4914B020081002">more</a>. Polskie Radio has <a href="http://www.polskieradio.pl/thenews/news/?id=92727">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />Jaruzelski and seven other Communist-era officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-ex-leaders-go-on-trial-for.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] last month, when prosecutors presented charges in a 500-page indictment. About 100 people are said to have died as a result of the martial law declaration and the subsequent arrests of Solidarity leaders, including now former Polish president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/963417.stm">Lech Walesa</a> [BBC profile], and some 10,000 people were held in internment camps. Jaruzelski faces 10 years in prison if found guilty of the charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thirteen United Nations experts on Monday <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/11D31EC19A6DCFA6C12574DA00389A5B?opendocument">urged the international community to respect the rights of detainees</a> [statement text]. The statement of the 13 special rapporteurs, including <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/">Philip Alston</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alston">news archive</a>], the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/">Manfred Nowak</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nowak">news archive</a>], the Special Rapporteur on torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, comes as the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] celebrates <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/DetaineesWeekInitiative.aspx">Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week</a> [UNHCHR materials]. The statement called on all states to respect the rights of detainees:<blockquote>All too often we have seen that discrimination existing in societies at large is exacerbated when people are deprived of their liberty. Even when policies and practices aim to treat everyone equally, they often overlook the particular needs of women, minors, non-citizens, the sick and the disabled. Poor detainees suffer disproportionally from overcrowding and their access to healthcare [sic] and food is often reduced to a minimum. Those detained far from home suffer the most for lack of family support. Members of vulnerable groups or women run an increased risk of falling victims to sexual violence and slavery-like practices within places of detention, frequently with the tacit approval of, or directly committed by, State officials. Too often detention serves as a means of punishment without educational opportunities, thus further marginalising [sic] detainees rather than helping them to prepare for release. ... On the occasion of the week on &quot;Dignity and Justice for Detainees&quot;, we call on all States to do their utmost to ensure that detainees, as all other human beings, are treated with respect and dignity. We also appeal to States to provide for effective complaints and monitoring mechanisms in places of detention, including efficient avenues to challenge the legality of detention and access to legal counsel, with a view to making human rights a reality for them.</blockquote> The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28432&Cr=detainee&Cr1=">more</a>.<br /><br />Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week comes during ongoing UN celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the signing of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/DetaineesWeekInitiative.aspx">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [declaration text]. In comments preceding the observance of Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navanethem (Navi) Pillay</a> [official profile], who took office last month, urged the military-led government of Myanmar to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/new-un-human-rights-chief-calls-for.php">release its remaining political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] while calling attention to &quot;unjust or inappropriate&quot; detentions worldwide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bosnian Serb leader and war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/latest-e/pressindex.htm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/karadzic.php">news archive</a>] has requested, in a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/submisions/080923b.pdf">motion</a> [PDF text] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>], that prosecutors release information regarding an alleged immunity deal with former US ambassador to the UN <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS profile]. Writing on his own behalf, Karadic said the ICTY&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/basic/rpe/IT032Rev38e.pdf">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [PDF text] grant him the right to use the information in defending himself: <blockquote>Dr. Karadzic contends that the documents described... are material to the preparation of his [defense]. It is part of his [defense] that (1) he was promised on 18-19 July 1996 by Richard Holbrooke that he would not have to face prosecution in The Hague if he agreed to withdraw completely from public life; and (2) that this promise is attributable to the ICTY because it was made on behalf of, or in consultation with the member States of the United Nations Security Council, or was reasonably believed to be so made. </blockquote>Karadzic first <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/submisions/080805.pdf">alleged</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=4079894&postID=4828041151643289743">report</a>] the existence of an immunity deal with the US in August when he asked the court to compel the testimony of both Holbrooke and former Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/40381.htm">Madeleine Albright</a> [DOS profile]. Both Holbrooke and Albright have denied the existence of such a deal, but former ICTY spokesperson Florence Hartmann has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/western-nations-blocked-karadzic-arrest.php">claimed</a> that the US and other Western countries delayed and <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-and-allies-impeded-efforts-to.php">impeded</a> [JURIST reports] Karadzic&#39;s arrest. AP has <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=5965302">more</a>. From Serbia, B92 has <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=10&dd=07&nav_id=54032">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In September, ICTY prosecutors filed a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-mai080922e.pdf">motion to amend</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">report</a>] Karadzic&#39;s indictment, as was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-to-amend-karadzic.php">planned</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. The existing <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">indictment</a> [text] contains 11 charges against Karadzic, including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and &quot;other inhumane acts.&quot; The proposed amendments would narrow the indictment with the intent of calling fewer witnesses to testify and simplifying the trial. Karadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. He was originally indicted in 1995 but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report]. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">repeatedly refused</a> to enter a plea on the charges, with an ICTY judge eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-again-refuses-to-enter-pleas.php">entering a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST reports] on his behalf. If the court approves the amended indictment, Karadzic will be asked to enter new pleas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenyan police Saturday confirmed that Ethiopian authorities have released eight suspected Kenyan terrorists, saying that the suspects have been reunited with their families. Kenyan authorities rendered the suspects to Somalia in early 2007, where they were handed over to the Ethiopian military and questioned by both US and Ethiopian intelligence. Kenyan officials will continue to monitor the released individuals, but declined to indicate whether they will face criminal charges. On Wednesday, <A HREF="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</A> (HRW) [advocacy website; JURIST <A src="/jurist_search.php?q=human+rights+watch">news archive</A>] called on the <A HREF="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/eastafrica1008/">Ethiopian government</A> [HRW materials; JURIST <A src="/paperchase/2008/10/ethiopia-must-release-rendition-victims.php">report</A>] to release rendition victims or prosecute them in an open court that meets basic fair trial standards. Xinhua has <A HREF="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/04/content_10147742.htm">more</A>.<br /><br />The governments of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia have all denied illegally transporting and jailing people, claiming they have only taken action against legitimate suspects. Human Rights Watch initially raised the east African rendition issue in March 2007 when it <A src="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">reported</A> [JURIST report] that the US, Kenya, and Ethiopia were cooperating with the transitional government of Somalia to detain refugees from the recent conflict there. Canada, Sweden, and Eritrea subsequently pressured <A src="/countries/ethiopia.php">Ethiopia</A> [JURIST news archive] to reveal additional details regarding foreign nationals allegedly held in <A src="/paperchase/2007/04/us-intelligence-agents-using-secret.php">secret prisons</A> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/index.htm">Citigroup Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/0,,,00.html">Wachovia Corp.</a> and <a href="http://">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</a> [corporate websites] announced Monday that they had <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2008/081006c.htm">reached an agreement</a> [Citigroup press release] to freeze litigation activity until at least noon Wednesday. The agreement follows a weekend of legal maneuvering, when a New York State appellate judge reversed a court order extending an exclusivity agreement that bars Wachovia from considering or entering into acquisition proposals with parties other than Citigroup. Citigroup brought suit against Wachovia on Friday after Wachovia announced that it had <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/press/2008/20081003_Wachovia">agreed to merge</a> [Wells Fargo press release] with Wells Fargo. Justice Charles Ramos, a trial judge with the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/comdiv/newyork.shtml">Commercial Division of the New York Supreme Court</a> [official website], granted emergency injunctive relief to Citigroup on Saturday, <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/index.htm">extending the exclusivity agreement</a> [Citigroup press release] with Wachovia until further order. On Sunday, Justice James M. McGuire of the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">Supreme Court Appellate Division</a> [official website] overturned that order, in part because Ramos made it while outside the state. Wachovia filed a <a href="http://www.truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wachovia-complaint.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Saturday in US <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], requesting that the court enter an order declaring the agreement with Wells Fargo &quot;valid, proper, and not prohibited&quot; by its exclusivity agreement with Citigroup. On Monday, Citigroup filed yet another state lawsuit against Wachovia and Wells Fargo, claiming that both had interfered with the acquisition process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials for <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> [corporate website] announced Monday that they have agreed to an <a href="http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=8272">$8.4 billion settlement</a> [press release] in response to allegations by 11 state attorneys general that subsidiary <a href="http://my.countrywide.com/">Countrywide Financial</a> [corporate website] engaged in deceptive business practices that harmed consumers. California Attorney General Jerry Brown, a leading figure in the negotiations, <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1582_draft_cwide_complaint2.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1582&">press release</a>] Countrywide in June, claiming that the company and some of its officers encouraged the purchases of risky, complex loans so that the company could then sell those loans and make a profit. Under the <a href="http://www.ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1618">terms of the agreement</a> [California attorney general press release] announced Monday, eligible subprime and pay-option mortgage borrowers from the 11 states will receive loan modifications under a &quot;home retention program&quot; allowing them to afford their mortgages, and some will receive interest-rate reductions and waivers of penalties. In addition, Bank of America agreed to temporarily stop offering subprime mortgages. Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price said in a press statement: <blockquote>Our program represents principal and interest reductions over time to borrowers on loans Countrywide owns and on loans Countrywide services on behalf of investors. By taking projected foreclosure losses and instead directing those funds into these proactive foreclosure prevention efforts, we create a solution in the best interests of both our customers and the investors whose loans and securities we service.</blockquote> State officials will run the mandatory program, which is scheduled to begin on December 1. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/business/06countrywide.html?em">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g_DW2i41PT32xJqK_gHEOqiILQ2QD93KRSIO1">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/meetings/2008/20080714/draftfedreg.pdf">approved new rules for home mortgage loans</a> [draft regulations, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-reserve-board-approves.php">report</a>] designed to reduce unfair lending practices and increase consumer protection.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George Bush on Monday <a href="http://mediasite.ashland.edu/mediasite/Viewer/Viewers/ViewerVideoOnly.aspx?mode=Default&peid=2d925538-bf92-4cc3-8e7c-4a43887b831c&pid=53974cd1-d61a-44d1-93cf-1dbaf288f680&playerType=SL1#">criticized</a> [recorded video; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081006-5.html">transcript</a>] the Senate&#39;s judicial nominee confirmation process and defended his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/judicialnominees/">appointment of judges</a> [WH materials] who he says strictly interpret the US Constitution. Bush made his remarks at an event sponsored by the <a href="http://www.ashbrook.org/">Ashbrook Center for Public Affairs</a> [academic website] and the <a href="http://www.fed-soc.org/default.asp">Federalist Society</a> [advocacy website], and emphasized the important role that federal courts, particularly the Supreme Court, have recently played in the governance of the country. He rejected the concept of an evolving, &quot;living&quot; Constitution, saying that judges should exercise restraint when interpreting it, and commended his recent Supreme Court appointees <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/judicialnominees/alito.html">Samuel Alito</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/judicialnominees/roberts.html">John Roberts</a> [WH profiles] for implementing this philosophy. Bush described the Senate&#39;s blocking of other federal judicial nominees as an abuse of its power to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html">provide</a> [US Constitution Article 2 text] &quot;advice and consent&quot; on the nominations. Using the treatment of abortive nominee <a href="http://www.gibsondunn.com/Lawyers/mestrada">Miguel Estrada</a> [firm profile], as an example, Bush said:<blockquote>When [he] was nominated for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court, he received a unanimous well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. Yet for more than two years he awaited a simple up or down vote in the United States Senate. He never got one. For the first time in history, the Senate used a filibuster to block a nominee to the Court of Appeals. This fine American endured years of delay; he had his character unfairly attacked, and ultimately withdrew his name from consideration -- all because a minority of senators thought they would not like his rulings on the bench and worried that a President might one day elevate him to the Supreme Court...<br /><br />... Unfortunately, Miguel Estrada&#39;s experience is not an isolated one. Many other well-qualified nominees have endured uncertainty and withering attacks on their character simply because they&#39;ve accepted the call to public service. Those waiting in limbo include: Peter Keisler for the D.C. Circuit, Rod Rosenstein for the Fourth Circuit, and dozens of other nominees to district and circuit courts across this country.<br /><br />Some of these nominees waiting for a simple up or down vote would fill court vacancies that have been designated &quot;judicial emergencies.&quot; While these vacancies remain unfulfilled -- unfilled -- legal disputes are left unresolved, the backlog of cases grows larger, and the rule of law is delayed for millions of Americans...<br /><br />... It is clear we need to improve the process for confirming qualified judicial nominees. This process will always be somewhat contentious. But there are a few things that the American people expect us to agree on. First, the American people expect nominees and their families to be treated with dignity. Nominees should not have to wait years for the up or down vote that the Senate owes them.</blockquote>The <font style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</font> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/06/AR2008100602851.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, members of the US <a href="http://src.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Senate Republican Conference</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senate-republicans-call-for-end-to.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for an end to delays in considering federal district and circuit court judges nominated by Bush, saying the delays have lead to chronic under-staffing of federal courts and that some courts have only three quarters of their positions filled, leading to case backlogs and the extensive use of visiting judges. Senate Judiciary Committee chair <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] has said that such delays are <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200409/090804A.html">common practice in election years</a> and that federal court vacancies have actually <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200806/062608e.html">decreased during president Bush&#39;s term</a> [press releases].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian authorities have asked Britain to extradite former <a href="http://eng.russneft.ru/">Russneft</a> [corporate website] oil company head Mikhail Gutseriyev, according to a <a href="http://eng.mvd.ru/">Russian Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website] spokesman Monday. Citing systematic <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6922943.stm">government &#39;persecution&#39;</a> [BBC report], Gutseriyev <a href="http://en.rian.ru/business/20070730/69956767.html">resigned</a> [RIA Novosti report] from Russneft in July 2007 amid Interior Ministry accusations of tax evasion and illegal business practice. The following month, Moscow&#39;s Lefortovsky District Court <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/08/business/rusoil.php">froze all Russneft shares</a> [IHT report] and the Tverskoi Court <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20070828/75425525.html">issued an arrest warrant</a> for Gutseriyev, but he had already fled the country. A Russian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office spokesperson <a href="http://www.interfax.com/3/434024/news.aspx">confirmed</a> [Interfax report] Monday that Russia filed an official extradition request with the UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office</a> [official website] on July 29, but said that no response has been received. The British embassy in Moscow did not comment on the request. Gutseriyev, who has maintained his innocence, would face up to six years in prison if convicted. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> has <a href="http://www.moscowtimes.ru/article/600/42/371483.htm">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20081006/117462135.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The UK currently has a strained relationship with Russia, due partly to Russia&#39;s refusal to extradite <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lugovoi+OR+lugovoy">Andrei Lugovoy</a> [JURIST news archive], the man suspected of administering poison in London to kill former KGB agent and British citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179074.stm">timeline</a>], so that he could <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/britain-charging-russian-in-probe-of.php">stand trial for murder</a> [JURIST report] in the UK. In July, a UK intelligence official said that there are &quot;very strong indications&quot; that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/russia-sponsored-litvinenko-poisoning.php">Russian government was behind the murder</a> [JURIST report]. Russian officials say the Russian constitution <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-formally-rejects-uk-extradition.php">prohibits the extradition of citizens for criminal trials in other countries</a> [JURIST report]. Britain has previously refused Russian extradition requests for suspects identified as being in the United Kingdom, including <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/british-judge-blocks-extradition-of.htm">Chechen envoy Akhmed Zakayev</a> [JURIST report] and business tycoon <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6559551.stm">Boris Berezovsky</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Boris+Berezovsky">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=dc+circuit">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200810/08-5357-1142234.pdf">stayed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district order requiring senior Bush administration officials to give the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] information about the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">forced resignations of nine US attorneys</a> [JURIST news archive]. In July, a federal district judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-rejects-white-house.php">rejected claims of executive privilege</a> [JURIST report] by former presidential counselor <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/20/AR2005062001161.html">Harriet Miers</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> profile] and current White House chief of staff <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/bolten-bio.html">Joshua Bolten</a> [official profiles], requiring Miers to testify before the committee and ordering Miers and Bolton to honor committee subpoenas for documents. Miers and Bolton sought a permanent <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dc-circuit-issues-temporary-stay.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] of those orders pending an expedited appeal to the DC Circuit. A three-judge panel granted the stay but denied the motion to expedite, writing that the matter could not be adjudicated before the current Congress adjourns. According to the <em>per curiam</em> opinion, <blockquote>[t]he present dispute is of potentially great significance for the balance of power between the Legislative and Executive Branches. But the Committee recognizes that, even if expedited, this controversy will not be fully and finally resolved by the Judicial Branch - including resolution by a panel and possible rehearing by this court en banc and by the Supreme Court - before the 110th Congress ends on January 3, 2009. At that time, the 110th House of Representatives will cease to exist as a legal entity, and the subpoenas it has issued will expire.... In view of the above considerations, we see no reason to set the appeal on an expedited briefing and oral argument schedule. If the case becomes moot, we would be wasting the time of the court and the parties.... If the case does not become moot despite the expiration of the subpoenas ... there would be no pressing need for an immediate decision.... This course has the additional benefit of permitting the new President and the new House an opportunity to express their views on the merits of the lawsuit. </blockquote>House Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://www.house.gov/conyers/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official website] said the committee would appeal the decision. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hq-4ZBiiUcq8IsbGQ0SHW04WS4kgD93L7SI00">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/06/AR2008100602521.html?hpid=moreheadlines">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February, the House <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-house-votes-to-hold-miers-bolten-in.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to hold Miers and Bolten in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Contempt_of_Congress">contempt of Congress</a> [Cornell Law backgrounder] for refusing to comply with the committee subpoenas. The House also authorized the committee to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/house-judiciary-panel-files-civil.php">bring suit</a> [JURIST report] against Miers and Bolton, as it did in March. Last week, US Attorney General Michael Mukasey <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/mukasey-names-prosecutor-to-investigate.php">appointed a prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether criminal charges are warranted in connection with the dismissals of the US attorneys, as recommended in a report by US Justice Department investigators. The <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] found &quot;significant evidence that political partisan considerations were an important factor&quot; in the 2006 dismissals and further determined that former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made a series of &quot;inaccurate and misleading&quot; statements about the removals.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Five Palestinians represented by Israeli rights group <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en&id=">Yesh Din</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/sys/images/File/YDMigronclaimFinalsue%5B1%5D.pdf">filed suit</a> [PDF complaint, in Hebrew] against the State of Israel seeking $427,000 in damages for failing to protect Palestinian-owned land in the West Bank from trespassers and an illegal outpost, according to Yesh Din lawyers Monday. The suit, brought in the Magistrate Court in Jerusalem, alleges that the <a href="http://www.binyamin.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=254">Migron</a> [Mateh Binyamin Regional Council backgrounder] community was illegally settled on the plaintiffs&#39; land with the assistance of Israeli authorities, altering its topography and blocking the owners&#39; access to the area. The Palestinian owners, the <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5icAhkCwbBq6Jhq8TVJMfiqVmGn3QD93L6F880">first to seek monetary damages</a> [AP report] from Israel in a land dispute, cite loss of potential income and Israel&#39;s breach of its duty to protect Palestinian property in the West Bank. Migron residents have stated that they do not intend to leave the disputed land. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem Post</span> has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1222017467453&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">more</a>. <br /><br />In September, a <a href="http://www.btselem.org/Download/200809_Access_Denied_introduction_and_Conclusions.pdf">report</a> [report summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/report-accuses-israel-of-excluding.php">report</a>] released by rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp">B&#39;Tselem</a> [advocacy website] alleged that Israeli security policies have resulted in Palestinians being prevented from accessing land adjacent to settlements in the West Bank. The report described two main Israeli behaviors against Palestinians in the West Bank, including the use of violence and harassment by settlers and security forces to keep Palestinians away from the settlements, and the building of a secondary fence to create a buffer zone consisting of empty land in a wide swath around the settlements. In July, Yesh Din highlighted the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/israel-police-unresponsive-to-violence.php">lack of investigations and prosecutions</a> [JURIST report] of Israeli settlers who commit crimes against Palestinians. In June, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asserted that Israeli <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">plans to expand settlements</a> [Ha&#39;aretz report] in the West Bank <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">violate international law</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from Germany&#39;s ruling coalition <a href="http://www.cdu.de/home/index_24458.htm">announced</a> [CDU press release, in German] Monday that they would draft an amendment to the German constitution to allow the military to aid local police forces during emergencies. Under Article 35 of the German <a href="http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/europe/DE/Germany%20Basic%20Law%20%28Constitution%29%202000.pdf/at_download/file">Basic Law</a> [text, PDF], the government may deploy the military domestically only if a natural disaster or accident seriously affects more than one German state. The proposed amendment would still strictly control domestic deployment of the military but would allow such deployment in a wider range of emergencies. Officials from the opposition Left Party <a href="http://die-linke.de/presse/presseerklaerungen/detail/zurueck/aktuell/artikel/fortsetzung-des-innenpolitischen-irrweges/">criticized the move</a> [statement, in German]: <blockquote>With the agreement to change Article 35 of the Basic Law, [the coalition] steps on the legacy of parliamentary advice. ... The parliament tried 60 years ago to incorporate the teachings from the time of fascism, but the coalition today wants to use the German Federal Armed Forces in the interior based on an abstract terrorism danger. The Left maintains ... [t]he regulations of Article 35 of the Basic Law are completely sufficient. </blockquote>The coalition plans to draft the amendment as soon as possible and then forward it to the <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/Federal-Government/Cabinet/cabinet.html">Cabinet</a> [official website, English version] for consideration. Deutsche Welle has <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3692971,00.html">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHlrJ3QdZG_ojqGm_x3pE2_U3kPQD93L1HJO0">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In the United States, the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001385----000-.html">Posse Comitatus Act of 1878</a> [text] traditionally bars US federal soldiers and National Guard troops under federal control are from conducting domestic law enforcement on US soil. In 2006, President George W. Bush signed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ364.109.pdf">legislation</a> [PL 109-364 text, PDF] that, in part, amended the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/ch15.html">Insurrection Act of 1807</a> [text] to allow the armed forces to &quot;restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident&quot; if the president determined certain conditions exist. The amendments were made after Bush <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/bush-call-for-pentagon-lead-in.php">suggested</a> [JURIST report] following <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive] that the Pentagon, rather than state and local agencies, should be in charge of the response to disasters. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and other critics <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200704/042407a.html">sponsored legislation</a> [press release] in 2007 to repeal the amendments, which Leahy said &quot;subvert[ed] sound policies for dealing with emergency situations that keep our Governors and other locally-elected officials in the loop when they are having to deal with disasters that affect the people they represent.&quot; The Insurrection Act amendments were repealed by the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h1585eh.txt.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008</a> [text, PDF], which Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/01/20080128-10.html">signed</a> [White House press release] in January.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.lehman.com/">Lehman Brothers</a> [corporate website] Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <a href="http://www.lehman.com/who/bios/#RSF">Richard Fuld</a> [corporate profile] Monday called for a new regulatory scheme for financial firms in testimony before the US <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [committee website]. Fuld answered questions regarding Lehman Brother&#39;s role in the current financial crisis and the the high levels of executive compensation at the firm in the run-up to its <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/dealbook/lehmanPETITION.pdf">Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing</a> [bankruptcy petition, PDF; <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/dealbook/lehmanAFF.pdf">affidavit</a>, PDF] and disputed lawmakers&#39; suggestions that Lehman Brothers managers defrauded investors by making public statements at odds with Lehman&#39;s internal financial health. In a prepared <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081006125839.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF], Fuld said:<blockquote>We now have the opportunity to create a new regulatory system and &#8220;best practices&#8221; for a functioning and orderly market. These new approaches must encourage rather than impede global investment in our capital markets. Shifting and inconsistent rules create a capital markets system that does not give confidence to investors or participants. We need a single set of transparent rules for all of the participants in order to have a fair and orderly market. We must stick to these rules and enforce them evenly, not selectively, or our great capital markets will not be attractive to investors. A loss of investment in our markets would have far-reaching consequences for this country and the American people.</blockquote> Also on Monday, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that US Attorneys offices in New York and New Jersey are investigating <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122333024089209177.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">whether Lehman Brothers misled investors</a> [<em>Wall Street Journal</em> report] prior to its bankruptcy filing. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/economy/07lehman.html?bl&ex=1223524800&en=6b2e328b1376df03&ei=5087%0A">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/06/AR2008100603173.html?hpid=topnews">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Lehman Brothers is one of the largest financial institutions to be stricken by the ongoing financial crisis. Last Friday, the House <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">passed a $700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to limit the effects of the crisis on the larger US economy and international markets. Last month, members of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-congress-considers-legislative.php">spoke out</a> [JURIST report] about regulatory changes and investigations following a stock market drop propelled by <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/Business/1079224.html">Lehman Brothers&#39; Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the sale of Merrill Lynch</a> [AP report]. Speaker of the House <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/">Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/Sept08/market.html">reiterated</a> [press release] plans for a new economic stimulus package designed to &quot;create jobs and address some of the most immediate consequences of the Administration&#8217;s serious mismanagement of our economy.&quot; Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Chris Dodd</a> (D-CT) [official website] <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/index.php?q=node/4552">said</a> [statement text] that the Banking Committee will continue to probe regulatory oversight and seek legislative solutions &quot;strengthening the housing sector, developing a second stimulus package, and restructuring the regulation of the financial sector.&#8221;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Trial proceedings began in Paris Monday in the case of 42 people, including the son of former French President Francois Mitterrand, allegedly involved in the so-called <a href="http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_get.php/141/All_the_Presidents_Men.pdf">Angolagate</a> [Global Witness report, PDF] scandal regarding the supply of illegal arms to the Angolan government between 1993 and 1998 in contravention of an international ban on weapons sales to the country. The 42 defendants are additionally accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks from the Angolan government in return for arranging nearly $800 million in arms shipments. Also included among the 42 defendants are Russian-Israeli billionaire Arkady Gaydamak and former French Interior Minister <a href="http://www.senat.fr/senfic/pasqua_charles77053g.html">Charles Pasqua</a> [French Senate profile, in French]. Angola is attempting to stop the court proceedings on the grounds that the trial will violate French law by exposing military secrets of a foreign country. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gCERqpPR4g-_qek8xz_CgrrrijRgD93L6KQO0">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jW5Ez_Asns57USSDljTlIiOpCQFg">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Angolagate affair involved large-scale arms sales to the Angolan government during the civil between government forces led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1506759.stm">President Jose Eduardo dos Santos</a> [BBC profile] and the <a href="http://www.unitaangola.org/WD110AWP/WD110Awp.exe/CONNECT/UNITAANGO?_WWREFERER_=&_WWNATION_=14">UNITA</a> [official website, in Portuguese] anti-communist movement, led by the late Jonas Savimbi. The Angolan civil war was largely a proxy war between Cuban communist-supported dos Santos government and the US-backed UNITA rebels. The Angolan government was supplied with arms, including rifles, land mines, grenades, and tanks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">news archive</a>] heard oral arguments Monday in three cases, including <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#altria">Altria Group v. Good</a> [merit briefs], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-562.htm">07-562</a>, in which the Court will consider whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch36.html">Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act</a> [text] bars state lawsuits based on allegedly deceptive cigarette advertising. A federal judge originally dismissed a suit brought by three Maine smokers who accused Philip Morris of presenting light cigarettes as less harmful than they really are, but the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=06-1965.01A">reinstated the case</a> [opinion text]. Appearing on behalf of Altria during Monday&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-562.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript], former <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/aboutosg/t_olson_bio.htm">Solicitor General Theodore Olson</a> [official profile] noted that the state law claims &quot;track nearly verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act&#39;s pre-emption provision.&quot; Arguing for the respondents, attorney David Frederick said that Congress had &quot;no intention whatsoever to immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that they made in violation of anti-deception-in-the-marketplace rules.&quot; Several members of the Court seemed skeptical of the respondents&#39; argument. Justice Samuel Alito suggested that the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website], which is supporting the respondents, had &quot;passively approved&quot; of the use of the allegedly misleading claims in advertisements. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iq0HLKcscsec0kKo11KLXIrtQznQD93L3HLG0">more</a>. SCOTUSblog has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/analysis-a-rough-day-for-the-ftc/">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Also <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-610.pdf">argued</a> [transcript] on Monday was another First Circuit case, <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#locke7610">Locke, et al., v. Karass</a> [merits briefs], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-610.htm">07-610</a>, raising the issue of whether a state may constitutionally require nonunion public employees to pay agency fees to a union acting as an exclusive bargaining unit when part of that money pays for litigation conducted by the union&#39;s national affiliate. Joining two other circuits, the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=06-1747.01A">ruled</a> [opinion text] such a requirement did not violate the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment if the expenses &quot;were substantively related to the bargaining process.&quot;<br /><br />Finally, the Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-610.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript] in <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#vaden">Vaden v. Discover Bank</a> [merits briefs], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-773.htm">07-773</a>, presenting the question of whether federal courts have jurisdiction to hear lawsuits brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode09/usc_sup_01_9.html">Federal Arbitration Act</a> [text] to compel arbitration when the claim does not raise a federal question but the underlying dispute to be arbitrated involves federal law. Finding that a federal question existed, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/061221.P.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the district court properly compelled arbitration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Senior officers in the <a href="http://www.defenceuganda.mil.ug/">Ugandan military</a> [official website] could held responsible for the use of child soldiers under a new US law, according to a Monday <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/UPDF_Generals_face_US_arrest_over_child_soldiers_72695.shtml">report</a> [text] in Kampala&#39;s <font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Monitor</font>. The <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s2135/text">Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2008</a> [text], <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081003-9.html">signed into law</a> [press release] by US President George W. Bush on Friday, provides for up to 20 years in prison for anyone found guilty of the recruitment or use of soldiers under the age of 15, and for up to life in prison if that use is associated with the death of a child. It also allows for the deportation or exclusion of that person from the US, gives the country jurisdiction over them if they are found present in the US, and provides for associated attempt and conspiracy crimes. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Monitor</font> said that given the breadth of the bill and international <a href="http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/files/country_pdfs/FINAL_2008_Global_Report.pdf">allegations</a> [CSUCS report, PDF] of child soldier use made against Uganda&#39;s military, it was possible that some Ugandan officers could be prosecuted under the law if they travel to the US. Ugandan officials were quoted rejecting the claim that military officers were guilty of using child soldiers.<br /><br />In January, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2007/757">report</a> [text] pushing for the enforcement of sanctions against 13 countries where groups or governments continue to use <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=child+soldiers">child soldiers</a> [JURIST news archive] in armed combat. According to the report, child soldiers continue to be used in Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, Myanmar, Nepal, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Colombia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Uganda in violation of international laws that protect children in armed conflict. Ban noted that the use of child soldiers violates in particular the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Convention of 1949 and its 1997 protocols</a>, the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989</a> and its <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/childprotarmed.html">optional protocol</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc87/com-chic.htm">International Labour Organization Convention No. 182</a> [texts].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=luis+moreno-ocampo">news archive</a>] on Monday renewed his call for the arrest of Ugandan rebel leader and war crimes suspect <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> [BBC profile; case <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/UGD/c0105.html">materials</a>] after new attacks attributed to the rebels. Moreno-Ocampo said Kony&#39;s group, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3462901.stm">Lord&#39;s Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lord%27s+resistance+army">news archive</a>], was responsible for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-20081006-PR359-Anx1.pdf">attacks on Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) civilians</a> [ICC release] earlier this month. Moreno-Ocampo also said that despite claims by Kony that he is willing to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/uganda-war-crimes-court-will-only-hear.php">negotiate a peace deal</a> [JURIST report], the recent attacks were characteristic of the LRA and called the peace talks an intentional distraction:<blockquote>These attacks all follow a similar method with markets surrounded and looted, students abducted from school, properties burned and dozens of civilians killed, including several local chiefs. Tens of thousands have now been displaced... Kony-just as he has many times in the past--uses the peace talks to gain time and support, to rearm and attack again. The price paid today by civilians is high. The criminals remain at large and continue to commit crimes and they are threatening the entire region. Arrest is long overdue.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jSFoB1FfLrS-3BjvmAm0xOtkMXCQD93L2HOG0">more</a>.<br /><br />Moreno-Ocampo in May announced the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icc-investigating-new-uganda-attacks-by.php">launch of a new investigation</a> [JURIST report] against Kony and other LRA leaders. In March,  Moreno-Ocampo maintained that <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uganda-lra-rebel-arrest-warrants-remain.php">arrest warrants issued by the ICC for LRA leaders</a> [JURIST report] remain in effect, despite requests from Uganda that they be withdrawn. The four ICC-issued warrants were executed in 2005 and include LRA leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> and LRA senior member <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/afric%20/7083311.stm">Vincent Otti</a> [BBC profiles]. In 2007, Otti was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7156284.stm">executed by rebels</a> [BBC report], though official confirmation of his death was delayed until January amid fears that it would disrupt peace talks. Kony is wanted for orchestrating the killing of thousands of civilians and the enslavement of thousands more children over two decades of conflict. The government has said that <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/uganda-officials-say-rebel%20leader.php">Kony is willing to face trial at home</a> [JURIST report], but not at the ICC. A fifth arrest warrant was initially issued for Raska Lukwiya but was later withdrawn after a July 2007 ICC pre-trial chamber decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/indexeng.asp">Italy&#39;s Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] was asked Saturday to rule on a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-upper-house-passes-law-granting.php">new law granting top Italian lawmakers immunity from prosecution</a> [JURIST report] while in office as a judge in Milan formally suspended a long-running corruption case against Italian Prime Minister and media magnate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [JURIST news archive]. For the last 18 months Berlusconi and lawyer David Mills have been on trial in connection with an alleged agreement by Mills to testify on Berlusconi&#39;s behalf in another proceeding in return for $600,000. In June the judge presiding over the trial said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-judge-says-berlusconi-corruption.php">hearings in the case would continue</a> [JURIST report] despite a request for her removal by Berlusconi&#39;s lawyers. The final passage of the immunity bill in July at the behest of the new Berlusconi government forced suspension of the trial, although the case against Berlusconi could resume if the high court rules against the law. The proceeding against Mills will continue. AFP has <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20081004%5cACQDJON200810041143DOWJONESDJONLINE000328.htm&&mypage=newsheadlines&title=Italian%20Court%20Suspends%20PM%20Berlusconi's%20Graft%20Trial">more</a>. <em>Corriere della Serra</em> has <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08__/berlusconi_processo_91a90f6c-91f6-11dd-b85e-00144f02aabc.shtml">local coverage</a> [in Italian].<br /><br />Italy has recently faced significant criticism by both <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-criticized-for-dissolving-anti.php">advocacy groups</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-judges-threaten-strike-over.php">members of the country&#39;s judiciary</a> [JURIST reports] for relaxing its anti-corruption measures. The majority of the criticism has been targeted at Berlusconi, who has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports]. In October 2007, Italy&#39;s highest court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/italy-high-court-upholds-berlusconi.php">upheld</a> Berlusconi&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/berlusconi-acquitted-of-bribery-charges.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST reports] on bribery charges. That trial was initially blocked in 2004 by a bill drafted by Berlusconi ally and later defense lawyer Gaetano Pecorella but went ahead after the bill was struck down as unconstitutional.

Delmar Dwayne Spier, Barbara Edens Spier, William Felix Dupre, and Behzad Mehr all worked for <a href="http://www.sepiasolutions.com/clients/uspi/">United States Protection and Investigation</a> (USPI) [corporate website] based in Houston. Commenting on the charges, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Adrienne R. Rish said that<BLOCKQUOTE>USAID and the American companies it relies upon to deliver development programs throughout the world must always be steadfast protectors of U.S. taxpayer funds. As highlighted by this indictment, the USAID Office of Inspector General will vigorously pursue the investigation and prosecution of fraudulent activities and hold accountable those who would attempt to violate the provisions of this integral component of the U.S. foreign assistance program.</BLOCKQUOTE>The indictment against the USPI staffers alleges they defrauded the United States &quot;by obtaining reimbursement for inflated expenses supposedly incurred by USPI for rental vehicles, fuel and security personnel.&quot; If convicted of major fraud the defendants could face up to 10 years and a $1 million fine. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20081003/D93J67PG3.html">more</a>.<br /><br />US officials and lawmakers have recently expressed growing concern over allegations of fraud by US subcontractors working in both Afghanistan and Iraq. In May, the <a href="http://www.dodig.osd.mil/">Department of Defense Inspector General&#39;s Office</a> [official website] concluded in a report that the US military had <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dod-audit-finds-iraq-reconstruction.php">failed to ensure</a> [JURIST report] that over $8 billion dollars in Iraq reconstruction contracts awarded between 2001 and 2006 complied with federal anti-fraud laws.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The United Nations will not open an investigation into the assassination of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>], UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=3463">told reporters</a> [press conference transcript] Tuesday. <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>], who is Bhutto&#39;s widower, has <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bhutto-husband-repeats-call-for-hariri.php">repeatedly called</a> [JURIST report] for the UN to conduct an inquiry similar to the ongoing investigation into the 2005 assassination of <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri</a> [JURIST news archive] which has already led to the establishment of a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/lebanon/tribunal/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> [official website]. Speaking at a press conference in New York, Ban said that the UN would opt for a fact-finding commission rather than an investigation: <blockquote>We have an agreement that there will be sort of some commission established under the United Nations, but [we are discussing] any detailed technical matters of who should be appointed as commission members and how it should be funded and how long it should be and what would be the scope. It is not going to be an investigation but we are looking at finding out all the situations on this assassination of Mrs. Bhutto. But we are still discussing this matter with the Pakistani Government.</blockquote> The comments marked the first time Ban had ruled out an investigation. <em>Pakistan Daily</em> has <a href="http://www.daily.pk/national/nationalnews/7712-united-nations-not-to-investigate-benazir-bhutto-murder.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/pakistan-national-assembly-calls-for-un.php">called for a UN probe</a> [JURIST report] into Bhutto&#39;s assassination in April, despite statements from then-President Pervez Musharraf that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/no-un-hariri-style-probe-of-bhutto.php">investigations would be conducted internally</a> [JURIST report]. The prospect of an international probe into the killing garnered some <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/11/benazirbhutto.pakistan1">criticism</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] within Pakistan itself, and the US, supporting Musharraf, took the position that a UN investigation was unnecessary. In July, the UN said that it had <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27355&Cr=Bhutto&Cr1=">reached a &quot;broad understanding&quot;</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/un-to-investigate-bhutto-assassination.php">report</a>] with Pakistan on logistical issues and questions of access to government officials central to a potential investigation into Bhutto&#39;s assassination. Bhutto was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in December 2007 at a political rally in Rawalpindi after she returned to the country from exile to lead her party in parliamentary elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1287e.htm">affirmed</a> [press release] the 2007 <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e-summary.htm">conviction</a> [judgment summary; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/former-serb-republic-leader-convicted.php">report</a>] of <A HREF="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/martic/cis-martic.pdf">Milan Martic</A> [ICTY case backgrounder, PDF; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1950829.stm">profile</a>] on 16 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of laws and customs of war, including persecutions, murder, torture, deportation, attacks on civilians, and wanton destruction of civilian areas. The Appeals Chamber reversed Martic&#39;s convictions on some specific alleged crimes. Martic, the former president of the breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in <a href=" http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=croatia">Croatia</a> [JURIST news archive], had been previously <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2007/pr1162e.htm">sentenced to 35 years in prison</a> [press release] for the extermination of hundreds of Croat, Muslim and other non-Serb civilians between 1991 and 1995. Both parties had appealed from the first judgment. The Appeals Chamber rejected Martic&#39;s argument that the Trial Chamber failed to take into account certain contextual aspects, particularly the aims of Serb leadership, and concluded that Martic&#39;s sentence should be upheld despite the overturning of some convictions. In addition, the Appeals Chamber sustained the prosecution&#39;s lone ground for appeal, agreeing that soldiers who were incapable of taking part in hostilities could still be victims of war crimes. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7659474.stm">more</a>. <br /><br />Martic was originally <a href="http://sim.law.uu.nl/sim/caselaw/tribunalen.nsf/ae4b0f7b22afa1cdc12571b500329d5e/e8b17d64bc2b39dbc12571fe004c8c7c?OpenDocument">indicted</a> [text] in July 1995. After several years as a fugitive, he surrendered to the Hague-based tribunal in 2002. His trial <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/trial-of-former-serb-republic-leader.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in December 2005 and ended in January 2007. In the original conviction, the ICTY Trial Chamber found that Martic exercised &quot;absolute authority&quot; over the RSK&#39;s Interior Ministry and security forces, and failed to prevent or punish war crime violations, and even encouraged the &quot;widespread and systematic&quot; persecution of Croatian non-Serbs. Martic was also found to be responsible for ordering an indiscriminate rocket attack on the Croatian capital of Zagreb, which killed seven civilians and injured at least 200 people.

According to Citigroup, the agreement provides for <blockquote>1. A standstill of all formal litigation activity effective immediately;<br />2. Ceas[ing] any formal discovery activities, and<br />3. Cooperat[ing] in good faith to agree among themselves to secure orders where necessary in all applicable cases in all jurisdictions tolling any schedules for the filing of litigation papers or court appearances or any other formal litigation deadlines, with the goal of preserving the status quo during the litigation standstill period. </blockquote>In light of the extension, hearings scheduled for Wednesday in the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/supctmanh/">New York State Supreme Court</a> and the US <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official websites] were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSN0817450420081008">postponed</a> [Reuters report]. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=avhUK9wumoZQ&refer=news">more</a>. The <em>Charlotte Observer</em> has <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/business/story/240105.html">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />The initial standstill agreement was announced Monday after a weekend of legal maneuvering in Citigroup&#39;s and Wells Fargo&#39;s efforts to acquire Wachovia. Wachovia and Citigroup <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/page/0,,134_307^1803,00.html">reached an &quot;agreement in principle&quot;</a> [Wachovia press release] last Monday providing that Citigroup would acquire a substantial portion of Wachovia operations for about $2.1 billion. As negotiations faltered, Wachovia <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/page/0,,134_307^1806,00.html">announced</a> [press release] on Friday that Wells Fargo had offered to buy it as an intact company for $15.4 billion. Later that day, Citigroup brought suit against Wachovia in the New York Supreme Court, which on Saturday extended an agreement providing for exclusive negotiations between those parties. On Sunday, the same court&#39;s <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">Appellate Division</a> [official website] overturned that order. On Saturday, Wachovia filed a <a href="http://www.truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wachovia-complaint.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in US district court, requesting an order declaring the agreement with Wells Fargo &quot;valid, proper, and not prohibited&quot; by its agreement with Citigroup. On Monday, Citigroup filed yet another state lawsuit against Wachovia and Wells Fargo, claiming that both had interfered with the acquisition process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers providing free legal advice to parents of children in China <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624498.stm">sickened by tainted milk products</a> [BBC report] have been pressured by Chinese officials to stop providing legal services, according to one of the lawyers speaking to the Associated Press Tuesday. The group of at least 100 lawyers, who were told that the scandal has become a &quot;political issue&quot; and should be left to the government, has already helped the family of one sickened infant <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i1PW8Su6EECm-m22gV1dABkLdHJQD93I4LTG0">file a lawsuit</a> [AP report] against Sanlu dairy farm, which has been at the heart of recalls. The Henan court has not yet decided whether it will hear the case, filed last week, which seeks $22,000 in compensatory damages for medical care the infant received for kidney stones after drinking milk produced by Sanlu. The lawyers have also been assisting other families with sickened infants in providing legal advice, but so far no other lawsuits have been filed following the recalls. <br />AP has <a href="http://www.wpix.com/landing_national/?Chinese-lawyers-say-authorities-pressuri=1&blockID=86480&feedID=24">more</a>.<br /><br />News of possible milk powder contamination by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke last month</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC News report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders. The death toll soon rose to four, and the number of sick infants in <a href="/countries/china.php">China</a> [JURIST news archive] has since ballooned to at least 53,0000. The <a href="http://english.gov.cn/links/statecouncil.htm">State Council of China</a> [official website, in English] has ordered free medical care to be provided for sick infants whose symptoms arose after September 12, when word of contamination first broke and the first milk powder recalls were ordered. Parents of many of the children who became sick before that date and who are not covered have sought legal advice and discussed the possibility of more joint lawsuits. Last week, tests performed by China&#39;s <a href="http://english.aqsiq.gov.cn/">General Administration of Quality Supervision</a> [official website, in English] found that 12 percent of milk produced by at least 37 companies in China was tainted. So far, police have <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCL58EMBN1tqq6xujZlsaITAFpCQD9393C101">arrested 18 people</a> [AP report] in connection with the scandal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US State Department legal advisor <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/48242.htm">John B. Bellinger III</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bellinger">news archive</a>],told the <em>Guardian</em> newspaper Tuesday that British troops in <a href="/countries/iraq.php">Iraq</a> and <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archives] are not detaining suspected insurgents in those countries due to concerns that the soldiers will be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/08/military.law">liable for their treatment of the detainees</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] under UK and European human rights law. Bellinger&#39;s comments stem from a <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j3670/al_skeini_v_state_1205.htm">2005 appellate court ruling</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/court-rules-uk-rights-law-bars-uk.php">report</a>] that British soldiers in Iraqi are forbidden to subject Iraqi prisoners to cruel or degrading treatment while in their custody. The Court of Appeal in London determined that the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1">Human Rights Act 1998</a> (HRA) [text], which enacted the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text, PDF] into UK law, applies to any UK military personnel with control over a detainee. The appellate court ruling arose in the course of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=baha+mousa">Baha Mousa</a> [JURIST news archive] scandal, in which British soldiers were alleged to have caused the death of an Iraqi detainee. <br /><br />Bellinger&#39;s comments come as controversy develops in the UK over the liability of the British government under UK and European human rights law for alleged later ill treatment of US terrorism detainees first taken into custody by British forces. Last week, the <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php">All Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> (APPG) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/141-legal-opinion-on-detainee-handovers-by-uk-forces">legal opinion</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/parliamentary-panel-gives-legal-opinion.php">report</a>] examining UK governmental liability under the ECHR and the HRA. The APPG opinion found that a human rights violation under both the ECHR and the HRA would occur where &quot;an individual in British detention in Iraq is handed over to US military personnel despite substantial grounds for considering that there is a real risk of that person being subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment.&quot; The APPG was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/parliamentary-group-challenging.php">convened in December 2005</a> [JURIST report] to call for a formal inquiry into whether the British government violated international law by participating in the CIA <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">news archive</a>] heard oral arguments Tuesday in three cases, including two raising issues of criminal procedure. In <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-513.html">Herring v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#herring">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-513.htm">07-513</a>, the Court will decide whether evidence seized during a search incident to an arrest must be suppressed when the sole premise for the arrest was information later found to be negligently provided by another law enforcement agency. More specifically, the Court must decide whether using the evidence found incident to such an arrest would violate <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] protections against unreasonable search and seizure. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200610795.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] last July that such suppression would not significantly deter the law enforcement agency providing the misinformation, because it would affect only the agency conducting the arrest. Representing the petitioner during Tuesday&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-513.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript], Pamela Karlan told the justices: <blockquote>Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department&#39;s arrests are with probable cause doesn&#39;t mean that when they arrest someone without probable cause you say, well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of &quot;good enough for government work&quot; theory. </blockquote>Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben countered that &quot;[i]n this case, where nothing is shown other than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that suppression of evidence will achieve ... appreciable deterrence.&quot;<br /><br />The Court also heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-542.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-542.html">Arizona v. Gant</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#arizona">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-542.htm">07-542</a>, presenting the question of whether &quot;the Fourth Amendment require[s] law enforcement officers to demonstrate a threat to their safety or a need to preserve evidence related to the crime of arrest in order to justify a warrantless vehicular search incident to arrest conducted after the vehicle&#39;s recent occupants have been arrested and secured.&quot; Arizona is appealing an Arizona Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supreme.state.az.us/opin/pdf2007/CR060385PR.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF text] that Rodney Joseph Gant&#39;s constitutional rights were violated when police searched his car after he was handcuffed and seated in a police car. <br /><br />The final case <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-636.pdf">argued</a> [transcript] Tuesday was <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-636.html">Kennedy v. Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan</a> [backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#kenndy7636">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-636.htm">07-636</a>, where the Court will consider whether the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode29/usc_sec_29_00001056----000-.html">Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) provision</a> [text; DOL <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq_qdro.html">backgrounder</a>] of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is the exclusive means by which to waive one&#39;s right to a divorcing spouse&#39;s pension benefits. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/05/05-41851-CV0.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> that the provision does not permit a waiver at common law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Leaders of both Philippine rebel groups and government militias could be held responsible for the use of <a href="http://www.childsoldiersglobalreport.org/content/philippines">child soldiers</a> [GSCR backgrounder] under a new US law, according to a Wednesday <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlc2Kf-HULqq60KarpfCF2nkkIbAD93M66N00">statement</a> [AP report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website]. The <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s2135/text">Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2008</a> [text], <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081003-9.html">signed into law</a> [press release] by US President George W. Bush on Friday, provides for up to 20 years in prison for anyone found guilty of the recruitment or use of soldiers under the age of 15, and for up to life in prison if that use is associated with the death of a child. It also allows for the deportation or exclusion of that person from the US, gives the country jurisdiction over them if they are found present in the US, and provides for associated attempt and conspiracy crimes. Leaders for one of the rebel groups, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3003809.stm">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> (MILF) [BBC backgrounder] have both <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200810/s2385859.htm?tab=latest">denied using child soldiers</a> [ABC report], and have said that the US law has does not affect them. In September, the Philippine government reported finding video recording of MILF rebels <a href="http://www.mindanaoexaminer.com/news.php?news_id=20080912011946">training minors</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Mindanao Examiner</span> report], and President Gloria Arroyo has planned to <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/121246/Arroyo-to-bring-up-child-warriors-issue-to-UN---report">file a complaint</a> [GMA report] against the group before the United Nations.<br /><br />Earlier this week, a Ugandan newspaper report said  that it was that senior officers in the <a href="http://www.defenceuganda.mil.ug/">Ugandan military</a> [official website] could similarly be <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/uganda-generals-could-be-prosecuted.php">held responsible</a> [JURIST report] for the use of child soldiers under the US law. In January, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2007/757">report</a> [text] pushing for the enforcement of sanctions against 13 countries where groups or governments continue to use <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=child+soldiers">child soldiers</a> [JURIST news archive] in armed combat. According to the report, child soldiers continue to be used in Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo, Myanmar, Nepal, Somalia, Sudan, Chad, Colombia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Uganda in violation of international laws that protect children in armed conflict. Ban noted that the use of child soldiers violates in particular the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Convention of 1949 and its 1997 protocols</a>, the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989</a> and its <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/childprotarmed.html">optional protocol</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/ilc/ilc87/com-chic.htm">International Labour Organization Convention No. 182</a> [texts].

Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> [official website] to give its position on providing $250 million this year toward the $8 billion needed to reform the state&#39;s prison health care system. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1024">US District Judge Thelton Henderson</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">Northern District of California</a> [official website] said the administration must provide details of when and how the money will be disbursed to the court-appointed prison medical overseer, <a href="http://www.cprinc.org/about_bios.aspx#ck">J. Clark Kelso</a> [official profile]. In August, Kelso <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-prison-receiver-asks-court.php">asked the court</a> [JURIST report] to force the state to pay $8 billion over five years to improve prison hospitals. Kelso had previously said that the California Senate was unwilling to authorize borrowing money for the project. He appealed to Schwarzenegger to use his <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-court-upholds-inmate.php">emergency powers</a> [JURIST report] to raise the needed funds but has accused the governor of failing to heed a federal order to secure the money. The administration is scheduled to present its response during a hearing on October 27. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gunrXFtgHU0w1G5y0fQGyKutU0ygD93MKL700">more</a>.

Bringing the system up to standards could take as long as four years, according to officials at <a href="http://www.cprinc.org/">California Prison Health Care Services</a> [official website].  Last year, the court <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judges-order-federal.php">created a three-judge panel</a> [JURIST report] to oversee the reduction of California&#39;s prison population after finding that overcrowding was preventing the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) [official website] from providing adequate mental health care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian court on Wednesday <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/khodorkovsky_in_colony/136682.html">extended the jail term</a> [defense release] of former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khodorkovsky">news archive</a>] until February 2009. Khodorkovsky headed the now-bankrupt <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040719-662739,00.html">Yukos Oil Co.</a> [<em>Time</em> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yukos">news archive</a>] and was sent to prison by the Russian government in 2005 to serve an eight-year sentence for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST reporst]. The extension follows the court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejection</a> of Khodorkovsky&#39;s July <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">application for parole</a> which he has since <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report]. His parole was denied based in part on alleged violations of prison rules, and on Thursday, Khodorkovsky was <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081009/117637406.html">sent to solitary confinement</a> [RIA report] after giving a non-permitted <a href="http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2008/10/esquire_interview_with_mikhail_1.htm">interview</a> [text] to <font style="font-style:italic;">Esquire</font> magazine. Lawyers for Khodorkovsky have <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/after_cassation/lawyers_statements/136686.html">called the interview a pretext</a> [defense release] for the court to deny his request for parole. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081008/117554595.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Khodorkovsky is facing 20 more years in prison if convicted on <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/khodorkovsky_in_colony/136483.html">new charges</a> [press release; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aspsM5RO5Q3Y">report</a>] of theft and money laundering. Prosecutors had first indicted Khodorkovsky on the additional <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/russia-prosecutors-file-new-money.php">money laundering charges</a> in February 2007. A Russian court had originally ordered that he be <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/russia-court-orders-khodorkovsky-moved.php">transferred to a Moscow prison</a> while the charges were investigated, but that order was later <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/khodorkovsky-denied-transfer-from.php">vacated</a> despite a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/khodorkovsky-sues-prosecutors-for.php">lawsuit by his lawyers</a> [JURIST reports] seeking the move. Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has always maintained his innocence and insisted that the charges against him are politically motivated, but Russian prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/russian-prosecutors-insist-khodorkovsky.php">denied those allegations</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] late Wednesday issued a temporary <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ca-stay-on-uighurs-10-8-08.pdf">stay</a> [order, PDF] of a district court order requiring the federal government to release 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur detainees</a> from the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives]. A three-judge panel wrote: <blockquote>The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion. </blockquote>The panel further ordered the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to file a motion for a stay pending appeal by 4 PM Friday. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5haaUbbec3uxr3NbHKhsI_Kpoe7PAD93MT6JO0">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100803776.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />DOJ attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/doj-asks-dc-circuit-to-stay-order.php">sought the temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday, hours after US District Judge Ricardo Urbina of the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/urbina-transcript-10-7-08.pdf">transcript</a>] that the Chinese Muslim detainees must be released into the United States. In the motion, the DOJ contended that Urbina&#39;s order &quot;raises legal questions of the highest magnitude.&quot; Urbina had given the government until Friday to transfer the Uighurs, who have been incarcerated at Guantanamo for six years. Although the government has determined that the Uighurs are not <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000948---a000-.html">unlawful enemy combatants</a> [10 USC 948a text; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=enemy+combatant">news archive</a>], it has linked them with the <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4347">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [MIPT backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US military officers feared for the mental health of alleged terrorism detainees held in isolation in the US, according to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/37040res20081006.html">documents</a> [ACLU materials; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/37083prs20081008.html">press release</a>] received through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and released Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The materials released Wednesday are a collection of heavily redacted e-mail communications between unidentified US military officials involved in the detention of alleged terrorism suspects <a href="/currentawareness/hamdi.php">Yaser Hamdi</a>, <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ali+al-marri">Ali al-Marri</a> [JURIST news archives] at US Navy brigs in Virginia and South Carolina. In one e-mail found in the released <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/natsec/dod_emails_20081006.pdf">documents</a> [materials, PDF], an unidentified US official expressed concern over Hamdi&#39;s mental health due to his imprisonment, saying:<blockquote>I saw the detainee this morning during routine daily rounds and found him to be in low spirits and somewhat depressed. ... He indicated he feels very stressed due to his incarceration and being here now for almost (14) [<em>sic</em>] months, with no news pertaining to his future. ... He went on to indicate that he feels as if he has been forgotten and that no one is working on getting him freed. ... He indicated that he would continue to endure, but he did not leave me with a good impression that he is capable of going on much longer. ... I know I can not give him any false hope, but I fear the rubber band is nearing its breaking point here and not totally confident [<em>sic</em>] I can keep his head in the game much longer. I will continue to monitor his behavior and get the [redacted] onboard [<em>sic</em>], but fear that once this individual decides to go south, there will be little if anything, [<em>sic</em>] I can do to bring him back around. I have directed my staff to pay close attention to his behavior, to pick up their discussions with him and that I will conduct evening rounds in an effort to assure him we are concerned about his state of mind and health and welfare </blockquote> AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOeXB9r75P4J0Wmj3Ut2RwszEswAD93M3O7G0">more</a>.<br /><br />Hamdi, a former US citizen, Padilla, a current US citizen, and al-Marri, a citizen of Qatar who had legal residency in the US, were all originally designated as <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatants</a> [JURIST news archive] by the US government following their apprehension. Hamdi was <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/breaking-news-hamdi-arrives-in-saudi.php">released to Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST report] in 2004, and renounced his US citizenship. Padilla, who was originally apprehended in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; in the US, saw his status changed from enemy combatant to criminal defendant in 2005 when he was charged with terrorism conspiracy charges. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">convicted of those charges</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007, and is currently serving a 17-year sentence at a federal &quot;supermax&quot; prison in Colorado. Al-Marri is still in US detention at the US Naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina, as an enemy combatant. His indefinite detention was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in July by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which held that if the government&#39;s allegations against him are true, the President is empowered by Congress to hold al-Marri in a military prison without charge as an enemy combatant. Al-Marri was arrested at his home in Peoria, Illinois by civilian authorities in 2001, and was indicted for other crimes. In 2003, President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/23/qatar.combatant/">declared him an enemy combatant</a> [CNN report] and ordered the attorney general to transfer custody of al-Marri to the defense secretary, claiming inherent authority to hold him indefinitely.  Al-Marri has <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/enemy-combatant-detained-in-military.php">claimed abuse</a> [JURIST report] while being held in the Charleston Navy brig.

Seventy-seven member states voted for a resolution that was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/serbia-president-asks-un-general.php">introduced by Serbia</a> [JURIST report] last month, while six voted against and 74 abstained. The states voting against were the United States, Albania, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Palau. US representative Rosemary DiCarlo said the vote against was because the resolution will not enhance stability in the region, and the US is comfortable that its recognition of Kosovo as an independent country abides by international law. Currently some 50 UN member countries acknowledge Kosovo&#39;s independent status, including the US, Japan, and many EU nations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_10-08-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call] Wednesday in three cases, including <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-1239.html">Winter, et al. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., et al.</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#winter">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-1239.htm">07-1239</a>, in which the Court will review a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/ninth-circuit-upholds-ruling-against.php">Ninth Circuit ruling</a> rejecting the Bush administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bush-grants-exemption-from.php">attempt to exempt the US Navy from environmental laws</a> [JURIST reports] so that the Navy could continue using sonar in its anti-submarine warfare training off the coast of southern California. In its petition for <em>certiorari</em>, the Justice Department argued that the decision interferes with the Navy&#39;s ability to prepare for war, that national security interests should override environmental regulations, and that there is no evidence to support the claim that the sonar exercises harm marine wildlife. The <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [advocacy website], which filed the lawsuit seeking to halt Navy sonar use due to harm caused to whales and other marine mammals, published a 2005 paper on the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/wildlife/marine/sound/contents.asp">impact of sonar on marine wildlife</a> [NRDC materials]. Appearing on behalf of the government during Wednesday&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1239.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript], <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/aboutosg/gregory-g-garre-bio.htm">Solicitor General Gregory Garre</a> [official profile] said that &quot;no marine mammal will be killed as a result of these exercises&quot; and that &quot;the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the environmental assessment are temporary and non-injurious.&quot; Richard B. Kendall, arguing for the respondents, characterized the case as presenting a &quot;very traditional question of equity jurisprudence&quot;: whether the district court&#39;s decision is supported by the evidence, in which case it cannot be reversed as clearly erroneous. Responding to Kendall, Justice Samuel Alito suggested there was &quot;something incredibly odd about a single district judge making a determination ... that is contrary to the determination that the Navy has made.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ifiaOAaDtMvC-0eCfFr3aLRLXgYAD93MDR1O2">more</a>. The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-scotus9-2008oct09,0,1312135.story">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In a second environmental case <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-463.pdf">argued</a> [transcript] Wednesday, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-463.html">Summers v. Earth Island Institute</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#summers">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-463.htm">07-463</a>, the Court will consider whether a group of environmentalists can sue to have a Forest Service regulation struck down or if they are limited only to suing to end programs enacted under that regulation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-463_ob.pdf">held</a> [PDF text] that the environmentalists could sue against the regulation itself.<br /><br />Finally, the Court heard arguments in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/06-1595.html">Crawford v. Nashville and Davidson County</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#crawford2">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/06-1595.htm">06-1595</a>, presenting the question of whether <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</a> [text] protects a government employee against being fired for cooperating with an internal sexual harassment probe against a superior. A payroll employee in the Nashville school system was interviewed as part of an investigation into harassment claims against a high-ranking official in the system; she alleges that the official later fired her in retaliation for her statements against him. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/06-1595_ob.pdf">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [opinion, PDF], ruling that Title VII protections did not extend to the employee because she was not the originator of the sexual harassment claims being investigated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attorneys for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/us-stay-motion-uighurs-cadc-10-7-08.pdf ">motion</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/October/08-ag-903.html">press release</a>] in the US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] late Tuesday seeking to delay the transfer of 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur detainees</a> from the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives], hours after a district judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">ordered their release</a> [JURIST report]. In the motion, Assistant Attorney General Gregory Katsas and other DOJ attorneys asked for a temporary stay of the order to allow consideration of a stay pending appeal to the DC Circuit. They wrote: <blockquote>The district court&#39;s order ... raises legal questions of the highest magnitude. The order directly conflicts with the basic principle that a decision whether to admit an alien into the United States rests exclusively with the Executive. Furthermore, the district court&#39;s order of release into the United States contravenes the considered judgment of Congress that aliens who, like the detainees, have sought to wage terror on a sovereign government - even one other than the United States - are ineligible for admission into this country. Finally, the district court&#39;s order threatens serious harm to the interests of the United States and its citizens, by mandating the Government release in the Nation&#39;s capital 17 individuals who engaged in weapons training at a military training camp. </blockquote>According to the motion, the DOJ will seek an emergency stay from the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] if the DC Circuit denies a temporary stay. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aUNPU5t8F6p0&refer=home">more</a>. NPR has <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95491991">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier Tuesday, US District Judge Ricardo Urbina of the US District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Bush administration to release the Uighurs into the United States, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/urbina-transcript-10-7-08.pdf">ruling from the bench</a> [transcript] that the Constitution forbids their indefinite detention without cause. Urbina gave the government until Friday to release the Chinese Muslims and further ordered immigration authorities not to take the Uighurs into custody upon their arrival in the US. The government has previously linked the Uighurs with the <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4347">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [MIPT backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. The Uighurs have remained at Guantanamo as US officials have been seeking countries willing to accept their resettlement. On Wednesday, the US Defense Department (DOD) <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12275">announced</a> [press release; AFP <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/1-0&fp=48ed341b6dbdd709&ei=CiXtSIOxN4HI9AS799n8CA&url=http%3A//afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jxuCXEAs-0WUMMiXr7fv4Lph0Ryg&cid=1255094094&usg=AFQjCNHjCqpaOHXXCh7i8utW4bYIL8D4Hw">report</a>] that it had transferred two more Guantanamo detainees - one to Algeria and one to Sudan. According to the DOD, about 520 detainees have been released from Guantanamo, while about 255 remain.<br /><br />9:15 PM ET - Late Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Courts of Appeals issued a temporary <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ca-stay-on-uighurs-10-8-08.pdf">stay</a> [order, PDF] of the order to release the Guantanamo Uighurs into the United States. The appeals judges wrote: &quot;The purpose of this administrative stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the merits of the motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion.&quot; Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE497C0Z20081009">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo was <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/prensa/2007/bol08/Oct/b81108.shtm">extradited</a> [press release, in Spanish] Tuesday from Mexico to Guatemala, where he is accused of authorizing transfers of $15.8 million from the budget of the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense during his presidency from 2000 to 2004. Portillo fled to Mexico at the end of his term amid corruption allegations, reportedly fearing he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4698457.stm">would not be afforded a fair trial</a> [BBC report] in Guatemala. The <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/">Mexican Attorney General</a> [official website, in Spanish] said that after Portillo surrendered himself to Mexican authorities, Tuesday&#39;s extradition took place under Article 10 of the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/sp/traites/sp_traites-ext-mex-gtm.pdf">Mexico-Guatemala Treaty of Extradition</a> [PDF text, in Spanish] and Article 34 of Mexico&#39;s <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/sp/mex/sp_mex-ext-law-1975.pdf">Law of International Extradition</a> [PDF text, in Spanish]. Portillo, who maintains his innocence, has agreed to face the charges and was <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtni_GV9heSrQiqOWfoPLcfuTOHw">released on bail</a> [AFP] after his transfer to Guatemala.

The <span style="font-style:italic;">Guatemala Times</span> has <a href="http://www.guatemala-times.com/guatemala/417-guatemala-seeking-justice-ex-president-portillo-extradited.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/mexico-allows-extradition-of-ex.php">signed an extradition order</a> [JURIST report] to hand Portillo over to Guatemalan officials, but he challenged its validity in court. In January 2008, the Mexican Supreme Court <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7219766.stm">upheld the order</a> [BBC report] as constitutional.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] said Tuesday that it has <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-242.htm">begun an agency review</a> [SEC statement] of US financial accounting procedures, including &quot;<a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-234.htm">mark-to-market</a>&quot; [SEC backgrounder] rules, pursuant to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">recently-passed $700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report]. The SEC statement coincided with the testimony Tuesday of current and former executives of insurance giant <a href="http://www.aigcorporate.com/corpsite/index.html">American International Group</a> (AIG) [corporate website; JURIST news archive] before the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [committee website; testimony <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2211">materials</a>]. AIG was the recipient of a $85 billion bridge loan from the US <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] due to financial instability that many of the former and current AIG officials attributed in some part to the ramifications of the mark-to-market accounting rules. In a prepared <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081007101236.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF], Martin Sullivan, who was President and CEO of AIG from March 2005 to June 2008, discussed the effect of the mark-to-market rule on AIG, saying:<blockquote>The accounting rules require that certain assets be &quot;marked to market.&quot; In other words, companies must declare the value of those assets, on a quarterly basis, at the price such assets could sell for on the market at that point in time. Companies must declare these values on their books even if they have no intention of, or immediate need to, sell the assets, and even if they have not realized any actual gain or actual loss. FAS 157, which was adopted relatively recently, set out specific guidelines as to how companies must determine the &quot;market price&quot; of certain categories of assets. However well FAS 157 operates under any reasonably foreseeable market conditions, in the unprecedented credit crisis which began in the summer of 2007, FAS 157 had, in my opinion, unintended consequences. ... [J]ust last week both the Securities Exchange Commission and this Congress recognized the effect of FAS 157. The SEC recognized that FAS 157 can have unintended consequences for financial institutions when markets seize up. The SEC has attempted to provide more flexibility for companies operating and reporting under the rule. In the recently passed legislation, Congress directs the SEC to further examine mark-to-market accounting and grants the SEC authority to suspend mark-to-market accounting requirements.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCBEplezRU4MUlI3wKRd0IZ9GCgQD93LOGC00">more</a>.<br /><br />The $85 billion bridge loan is intended to allow AIG time to sell off its assets in an orderly fashion in order to avoid the negative consequences of a bankruptcy or collapse during the current financial crisis. The House passed the $700 billion rescue bill in an attempt to limit the effects of the crisis on the larger US economy and international markets. Last month, members of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-congress-considers-legislative.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] regulatory changes and investigations following a stock market drop propelled by <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/Business/1079224.html">Lehman Brothers&#39; Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the sale of Merrill Lynch</a> [AP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US district judge <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/urbina-minute-order.pdf">ordered the Bush administration</a> [minute order, PDF text] Tuesday to release 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur detainees</a> from the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], ruling that the Constitution forbids their indefinite detention without cause. In a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/urbina-transcript-10-7-08.pdf">ruling</a> [transcript] read from the bench, <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/urbina-bio.html">Judge Ricardo Urbina</a> [official profile] of the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/ ">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] gave the government until Friday to release the Chinese Muslims into the United States, marking the first time that a US court has ordered Guantanamo detainees to be freed. Urbina rejected arguments by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] that the court could not require the Uighurs&#39; release without violating the doctrine of separation of powers. He further ordered immigration authorities not to take the Uighurs into custody upon their arrival in the US. Another hearing in the case is scheduled for October 16. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQWbEoO3FnWNVOraJHQJo38l7TYgD93LP54O3">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100700466.html?hpid=topnews">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called on the US government Monday to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/06/usint19927.htm">parole the Uighurs</a> [press release]. In June, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200806/06-1397-1124487.pdf">ordered the government</a> [opinion, PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-enemy.php">report</a>] to release or transfer one of the Uighurs from Guantanamo, ruling that he had been improperly designated as an enemy combatant. In March, one of the Uighurs wrote in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/chinese-uighur-guantanamo-detainee.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] released by his lawyers that the detainees had not been told why they were being held at the military facility. The government has previously linked the Uighurs with the <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4347">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [MIPT backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. The Uighurs have remained at Guantanamo while US officials have been seeking countries willing to accept their resettlement.<br /><br />10/14/08 - Urbina&#39;s <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1310-45">memorandum opinion</a> [PDF text] accompanying the order to free the Uighur detainees has been released.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Fiji&#39;s High Court on Thursday <a href="http://www.fijitimes.com/extras/qarase-vs-bainimarama-coup-case-judgement.pdf">dismissed</a> [decision, PDF] a legal challenge to the country&#39;s 2006 coup, holding that <a href="http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/president.shtml">Fijian President Ratu Josefa Iloilo</a> [official profile] had the authority to name new leaders after former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1535214.stm">Laisenia Qarase</a> [BBC profile] was ousted by the Fijian military. Qarase originally <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/fiji-court-hears-ousted-pms-challenge.php">brought suit</a> [JURIST report] against the government in October 2007, saying that the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/fijian-military-carries-out-coup.php">military coup</a> [JURIST report] was illegal because it had supplanted his democratically elected government. Rejecting Qarase&#39;s argument, the court held that Iloilo had acted within the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/fj00t___.html">constitution</a> [text], characterizing his naming of a new prime minister as an allowable retention of authority until a new prime minister could be elected. Qarase <a href="http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=103000">expressed disappointment</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Times</span> report] in the ruling, saying it would encourage future coups as a legitimate means of gaining power. He is considering appealing the case to the country&#39;s Supreme Court. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iy2-Boc_qN8K9Ve3NJEJgsmh5zNQD93MN59O0">more</a>. FBCL has <a href="http://www.radiofiji.com.fj/fullstory.php?id=15076">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In September, Qarase made additional charges that current prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/769527.stm">Commodore Frank Bainimarama</a> [BBC profile] and others who participated in the December 2006 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=fiji+coup">military coup</a> [JURIST news archive] had <a href="http://fijidailypost.com/news.php?section=1&fijidailynews=18723">committed treason</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Daily Post</span> report] by ousting Qarase&#39;s democratically elected government. Later that month, Qarase <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fiji-ex-pm-unable-to-make-statement-on.php">tried to make a statement</a> [JURIST report] to police regarding the allegations, but they said they would not investigate the charges. Less than two days after December&#39;s coup, a previous interim prime minister installed by the military <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/interim-fiji-pm-installed-by-military.php">characterized the coup as &quot;illegal&quot;</a> [JURIST report], but defended it as necessary. Qarase&#39;s case was heard by a three-judge panel led by Acting Chief Justice Anthony Gates, who was <a href="http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_8181.shtml">appointed</a> [press release] after Bainimarama <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/fiji-coup-leader-suspends-top-judge.php">suspended former Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/index.html">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official website] said Friday that it is investigating allegations made by two members of the US military that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/home_html.cfm">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] eavesdropped on the personal conversations of members of the military and humanitarian aid workers stationed in the Middle East. The allegations were made by Adrienne Kinne and David Murfee Faulk, who worked as Arab linguists for the Army and Navy respectively, in an <a href="javascript:openPopup('http://abcnews.go.com/video/playerIndex?id=6000186',%20'popup',%20800,%20635,%20'status=1,%20resizable=1');">interview</a> [recorded video; <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=5987804&page=1">report</a>] with ABC News Thursday. In the interview, Faulk recounted listening to private conversations that had been passed around by other operators in the office he worked in, while Kinne said she listened to conversations from members of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Red Cross</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors without Borders</a> [advocacy website]. The NSA has said that it found some of the allegations to be without support, and that it is still investigating others. According to a spokesperson for <a href="https://www.cia.gov/about-cia/leadership/hayden.html">General Michael Hayden</a> [official profile], the current director of the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] and who was head of the NSA at the time of the allegations, Hayden did not authorize nor did he have knowledge of the interception of private conversations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from voter rolls against federal voting law, according to a <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?hp">report</a> [text] published Thursday. The report examined the actions of election officials in Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina, and found that the removal of a number of registered voters violated the <a href="http://fec.gov/hava/law_ext.txt">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) [text]. Under HAVA, states are only allowed to cross-check voter rolls with lists from the federal <a href="http://ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> [official website] as a last resort. According to the <em>Times</em>, a number of states have used the Social Security list as a first option, leading to a large number of voters being stricken from the more current state voting rolls. HAVA was signed into law by President Bush in 2002, and aims to provide greater protection to voters in the wake of the controversy over the results of the 2000 presidential election that pitted now-president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">George W. Bush</a> [WH website] against former vice president <a href="http://www.algore.com/">Al Gore</a> [personal website]. <br /><br />The <em>Times</em> report adds to growing controversy over voting laws and procedures in the run-up to November 2008 voting. Earlier this month, both the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default_highres.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> and the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ohio-to-proceed-with-absentee-voting.php">rejected Republican challenges</a> [JURIST report] to a directive by the Ohio secretary of state that would co-mingle absentee and regular ballots. Last month, voting rights advocates and elections officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/wisconsin-elections-agency-says-id.php">expressed fears</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/files/326371.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint text, PDF; <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/2008/nr091008_AG.asp">press release</a>] brought by the <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Wisconsin Department of Justice</a> [official website] will effectively disenfranchise thousands of voters by causing chaos at the polls in November. <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen</a> [official profile] filed suit against the state&#39;s <a href="http://elections.state.wi.us/">Government Accountability Board</a> [official website] on Wednesday, seeking to force the elections agency to cross-check the identities of recently registered voters against names in other state databases, pursuant to HAVA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Alaskan <a href="http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_com_info.asp?comm=SLEC&session=2">Legislative Council</a> [official website] on Friday released a <A HREF="http://media.adn.com/smedia/2008/10/10/16/Branchflowerreport.source.prod_affiliate.7.pdf">report</A> [PDF text] finding that Alaskan Governor and current Republican vice presidential candidate <A HREF="http://www.gov.state.ak.us/bio.html">Sarah Palin</A> [official profile] violated the state&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.law.state.ak.us/pdf/ethics/Statutes-AlaskaExecutiveBranchEthicsAct_AS39.52_.pdf">Executive Branch Ethics Act</A> [PDF text] by allowing personal ill will to influence her decision to dismiss Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan. Independent investigator Stephen Branchflower found that Sarah Palin and her husband, Todd Palin, violated the public trust by using their influence in the Governor&#39;s Office to pressure for the firing of Palin&#39;s former brother in law, State Trooper Mike Wooten. Monegan alleges that he was dismissed because he resisted the pressure. Branchflower found that while Monegan was not dismissed solely over his refusal to fire Wooten, it was likely a contributing factor. The report found that the firing was nevertheless a &quot;proper and lawful exercise&quot; of Palin&#39;s authority to hire and fire executive branch heads under the Alaskan law. The <em>New York Times</em> has <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/politics/11trooper.html?hp">more</A>.<br /><br />The report, commissioned in July by the bipartisan Council, has not been officially endorsed by the body. Palin was not subpoenaed during the investigation, and refused to cooperate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A migrant worker in <a href="/countries/china.php">China&#39;s</a> [JURIST news archive] South Guangdong Province filed a lawsuit Friday against Chinese dairy producer Sanlu Group, the company at the heart of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624498.stm">tainted milk crisis</a> [BBC report] which is blamed for four infant deaths and the sickening of more than 54,000 children. According to his lawyer, Zhang Xiuwen filed the suit seeking $132,000 after it was determined that his 11-month old son was suffering from kidney stones. The child had been fed formula made by Sanlu since his birth. It is not clear whether the Guangzhou Intermediate People&#39;s Court will accept the lawsuit at this point. This is the second lawsuit filed against the dairy producer. The first suit was <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i1PW8Su6EECm-m22gV1dABkLdHJQD93I4LTG0">filed</a> [AP report] earlier this month by a family whose 14-month old son was also diagnosed with kidney stones. It is not clear whether the Zhenping county court will hear that suit, which seeks $22,000 in compensatory damages for medical care the infant received. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i1PW8Su6EECm-m22gV1dABkLdHJQD93NHQUG0">more</a>.<br /><br />News of possible milk powder contamination by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders. The death toll soon rose to four, and the number of sick infants in China has since ballooned to at least 53,0000. The <a href="http://english.gov.cn/links/statecouncil.htm">State Council of China</a> [official website, in English] has ordered free medical care to be provided for sick infants whose symptoms arose after September 12, when word of contamination first broke and the first milk powder recalls were ordered. The situation has also lead the State Council to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/10/content_10174740.htm">issue new regulations</a> [Xinhua report] for dairy products in the country. So far, police have <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/10/content_10176392.htm">arrested 36 people</a> [Xinhua report] in connection with the scandal. Earlier this week, however, AP reported that lawyers providing free legal advice to parents of sickened children in China have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-lawyers-allege-political-pressure.php">pressured by Chinese officials</a> [JURIST report] to stop providing legal services.

The <font style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</font> has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_288231.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The petition comes as the PPP party faces broad public criticism and <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5goXqQzELZD-TQYTEs7cg84gh0Kiw">protests</a> [AFP report] opposing its rule. In late September, the Election Commission said it would <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/300908_News/30Sep2008_news10.php">begin an investigation</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok post</font> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-ruling-party-planning-to-amend.php">report</a>] into allegations that Wongsawat illegally holds stocks in companies which operate under government contracts. Earlier that month, then prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Samak+Sundaravej">news archive</a>] instituted a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] to quell the demonstrations, but was later removed from office after receiving illegal compensation for an appearance on a television cooking show. The PPP has also been closely associated with former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], now on trial for corruption.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/default.htm">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR289/289CR152.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the <a href="http://www.cslib.org/constitutionalAmends/constitution.htm">Connecticut Constitution</a> [text] requires that <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex couples</a> [JURIST news archive] be allowed to marry. In a 4-3 decision, the court reversed a lower court&#39;s judgment, concluding that state <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/sup/Chap815f.htm">statutes</a> [text] discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, that such a classification is &quot;quasi-suspect&quot; under the equal protection provisions of the state constitution and is therefore subject to heightened judicial scrutiny, and that the state failed to provide sufficient justification for excluding same-sex couples from marriage. In an 85-page opinion, the majority wrote: <blockquote>Like these once prevalent views, our conventional understanding of marriage must yield to a more contemporary appreciation of the rights entitled to constitutional protection. Interpreting our state constitutional provisions in accordance with firmly established equal protection principles leads inevitably to the conclusion that gay persons are entitled to marry the otherwise qualified same sex partner of their choice. To decide otherwise would require us to apply one set of constitutional principles to gay persons and another to all others. The guarantee of equal protection under the law, and our obligation to uphold that command, forbids us from doing so. In accordance with these state constitutional requirements, same sex couples cannot be denied the freedom to marry. </blockquote>The court remanded the case with instructions to grant summary judgment and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, who are eight same-sex couples denied marriage licenses by the town clerk of Madison, Connecticut. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4996BE20081010">more</a>. The <em>Hartford Courant</em> has <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hcu-gaymarriage-1010,0,7812756.story">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In May, the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] that state&#39;s ban on same-sex marriage, ruling that it violated protections on the right to &quot;form a family relationship&quot; enshrined in the California Constitution. In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/courtsandjudges/courts/supremejudicialcourt/goodridge.html">legalize same-sex marriage</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">report</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Seoul High Court Friday affirmed a suspended three-year prison sentence and fine for former <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] Chairman and CEO <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/samsunggroup/chairman/SAMSUNGGroup_PersonalProfile.html">Kun-Hee Lee</a> [corporate profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kun-Hee+Lee">news archive</a>], but cleared Lee of a conviction for breach of trust. According to the <em>Korea Times</em>, the High Court took Lee&#39;s poor health and contribution to the Korean economy into account when it <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_32491.html">vacated the breach of trust conviction</a> [<em>Korea Times</em> report]. Lee was convicted of tax fraud and breach of trust earlier this year. The High Court ruling affirmed Lee&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-korea-court-suspends-sentence-of.php">July sentencing</a> [JURIST report] by the Seoul Central District Court, which held that Lee should not serve prison time because he did not actively seek to avoid taxes. That decision was criticized by many in a country where wealthy corporate leaders are often seen as above the law. In April, South Korean prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/samsung-ceo-indicted-for-alleged-tax.php">charged Lee with breach of trust and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], but decided not to indict him based on accusations that Samsung maintained a $200 million slush fund to bribe prosecutors, judges and civil servants. Nine other Samsung executives were indicted on similar charges. Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/south-korea-prosecutors-question.php">questioned Lee</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gq4trY6H-pHK0BfSq6JlETCxtHgA">more</a>. <br /><br />Samsung, South Korea&#39;s largest corporation, has been at the center of numerous legal battles over the past few years. In May 2007, a South Korean appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/south-korea-court-upholds-convictions.php">upheld</a> the conviction of two Samsung executives connected with <a href="/paperchase/2003/12/regulators-eye-invesco-funds-in.htm">illegal stock trading</a> [JURIST reports]. In April 2007, another Samsung executive <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/April/07_at_263.html">pleaded guilty</a> [US DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/sixth-samsung-executive-pleads-guilty.php">report</a>] to US charges of conspiring to artificially inflate the cost of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), affecting the price of personal computers worldwide. In 2005, Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/samsung-doj-reach-deal-in-price-fixing.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice to plead guilty to charges that it conspired with other technology companies to fix prices on DRAM chips.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/">Chinese Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, English version] again demanded Thursday that the United States repatriate 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] that a US district judge has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">ordered to be released</a> [JURIST report] from the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. During a <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t517473.htm">press conference</a> [transcript], Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the Uighurs, who are members of an ethnic Chinese Muslim minority, would be dealt with &quot;according to the law&quot; if returned. Qin told reporters: <blockquote>We have repeatedly and explicitly stated our position on this issue. We require the US to repatriate these terrorist suspects to China with no delay. This position has stayed unchanged. Any unbiased mind with some knowledge about China would not worry about the so-called torture issue. The Chinese Government runs the country under the rule of law. Besides, China joined the UN Convention Against Torture as early as 1988. Chinese Authorities including those in charge of justice and public security all prohibit torture. </blockquote>The order to release the Uighurs into the US from Guantanamo has been temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/dc-circuit-stays-uighurs-release-from.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] by the US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website]. In issuing the stay Wednesday, the DC Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ca-stay-on-uighurs-10-8-08.pdf">ordered</a> [PDF text] attorneys for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] to file a motion for a stay pending appeal by 4 PM Friday. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iU9qvydNlxljHNUHuBRvFUY2puJAD93N1R7O2">more</a>. Voice of America has <a href="http://voanews.com/english/2008-10-09-voa9.cfm">additional coverage</a>. China&#39;s official Xinhua News Agency has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/07/content_10160889.htm">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, China reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-executes-two-uighur-muslims-for.php">executed two Uighurs</a> [JURIST report] alleged to be members of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/03/mil-080312-cfr01.htm">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a militant group calling for separation from China and designated a terrorist group by the United States for suspected ties to al Qaeda. Thirteen other Uighurs were given jail terms ranging from ten years to life imprisonment. In 2006, China <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/china-wants-gitmo-uighurs-back-says.php">criticized</a> the United States for <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">releasing five Uighurs to Albania</a> [JURIST reports], where officials reviewed their applications for asylum. In 2005, a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/federal-judge-rules-chinese-gitmo.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that two Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay could be detained indefinitely even though their imprisonment was unlawful because they could face death or torture in China. The US State Department has said the Uighurs are among detainees who <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/us-to-release-100-guantanamo-detainees.php">will be released</a> [JURIST report] once the US receives assurances that they will not be persecuted in their home countries or finds other countries willing to accept them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/index.htm">Citigroup Inc.</a> [corporate website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2008/081009g.htm">announced</a> [press release] that it would not seek to enjoin the acquisition of <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/0,,,00.html">Wachovia Corp.</a> by <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</a> [corporate websites] but would pursue claims against both financial institutions for alleged breach of contract and tortious interference with contract. Citigroup&#39;s decision to abandon negotiations to acquire a substantial portion of Wachovia operations clears the way for the $15.4 billion merger with Wells Fargo, which was <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/page/0,,134_307^1806,00.html">proposed</a> [Wachovia press release] last week. Citigroup said in a statement: <blockquote>We are proud to have been part of an historic transaction that was supported by all of the federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the President, and that we carefully designed to avoid systemic stress and to advance the interests of our shareholders....<br /><br />Without our willingness to engage in this transaction, hundreds of billions of dollars of value would have been seriously threatened. We stood by while others walked away. Now, our shareholders have been unjustly and illegally deprived of the opportunity the transaction created. </blockquote>Wachovia and Wells Fargo now face a <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2008/081006a.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2008/081006a.htm">press release</a>] that Citigroup filed Monday in the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/comdiv/newyork.shtml">Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York</a> [official website], seeking $20 billion in compensatory damages and $40 billion in punitive damages from Wells Fargo for allegedly interfering with the Citigroup-Wachovia negotiations. Wachovia is also a defendant in that action for alleged bad faith breach of contract. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a.eHnbhppDgE&refer=home">more</a>. The <em>Charlotte Observer</em> has <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/business/story/243886.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Citigroup announcement ends a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/citigroup-wachovia-wells-fargo-agree-to.php">litigation standstill</a> [JURIST report] that the three financial institutions agreed upon Monday after a weekend of legal maneuvering. Wachovia and Citigroup <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/page/0,,134_307^1803,00.html">reached an &quot;agreement in principle&quot;</a> [Wachovia press release] last Monday providing that Citigroup would acquire Wachovia operations worth about $2.1 billion. As negotiations faltered, Wachovia announced Friday that Wells Fargo had offered to buy it as an intact company. Later that day, Citigroup brought suit against Wachovia in the New York Supreme Court, which on Saturday <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/press/2008/081004a.htm">extended an agreement</a> [press release] providing for exclusive negotiations between those parties. On Sunday, the same court&#39;s <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">Appellate Division</a> [official website] overturned that order. On Saturday, Wachovia filed a <a href="http://www.truthonthemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wachovia-complaint.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in US district court, requesting an order declaring the agreement with Wells Fargo &quot;valid, proper, and not prohibited&quot; by its agreement with Citigroup.

The chamber upheld an earlier <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Munyakazi/decisions/080528.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF; official <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2008/563.htm">press release</a>] by an ICTR panel denying the request based on concerns that punishments imposed in place of the now-abolished death penalty might not conform with international human rights standards, and that the Rwandan judiciary might not be fully independent and immune from outside pressure. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga in May <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/rwanda-justice-officials-criticize-ictr.php">criticized the earlier decision</a> [JURIST report] and insisted that Rwanda&#39;s judicial system was fully independent and capable of guaranteeing a fair trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] issued two decisions Thursday finding Russia in violation of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] in cases concerning the <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=2&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=14534925&skin=hudoc-pr-en">deaths</a> or <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=14535309&skin=hudoc-pr-en">abductions</a> [press releases] of Russian nationals in Chechnya in 2000. The court ruled in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Vakhazhi%20|%20Albekov&sessionid=14535032&skin=hudoc-en">Albekov v. Russia</a> [judgment text] that Russia violated Article 2 of the Convention by failing to carry out effective criminal investigations into the deaths of or injuries sustained by three Russians caused by several land mine explosions. The court also ruled in <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Abdulkasim%20|%20Zaurbekov&sessionid=14535379&skin=hudoc-en">Zaurbekov v. Russia</a> [judgment text] that Russia violated several articles of the Convention in connection with the October 2000 disappearance of Abdulkasim Zaurbekov, and Russia&#39;s subsequent failure to investigate. The court directed Russia to pay a total of more than &#8364;88,000 ($121,000) to the families. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081009/117644852.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The ECHR has consistently ruled against Russia in similar cases involving Chechnya rights violations. In May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Russia was responsible for the disappearance of a dozen people during Russian armed raids in Chechnya in 2002 and 2003. In July 2007, the court ruled that Russian authorities were responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/echr-rules-russia-responsible-for.php">shooting deaths of 11 unarmed Chechen civilians</a>, and in June 2007 it held that Russian authorities were liable for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/russia-responsible-for-chechen-deaths.php">2003 deaths of four Chechen family members</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Assistant Secretary of State David Welch said Thursday that Libya has <a href="http://state.gov/p/nea/rls/rm/110885.htm">made an initial deposit</a> [briefing transcript] into a US government account as part of a deal to settle claims involving Libyan-linked terrorism in the 1980s. Under the agreement, Libya will pay $1.5 billion to settle claims for victims of the 1988 bombing of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6236538.stm">Pan Am Flight 103</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pan+Am+Flight+103">news archive</a>] over Lockerbie, Scotland and the 1986 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/5/newsid_4357000/4357255.stm">bombing of the La Belle disco</a> [BBC backgrounder] in Berlin, Germany. An additional $300 million will be provided by the United States to compensate Libyan victims of retaliatory air strikes that followed the disco bombing. Funding for the US portion is unclear; Bush Administration officials indicated that no US tax dollars would be used to pay for the settlement. Welch said: &quot;we deem [the deposit] to be evidence of [Libya]&#39;s commitment to fully implementing the whole agreement, and a substantial indication of their commitment&quot;. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ioldoglB9NS7sO2LOY6qQtqgztTgD93N5J581">more</a>.<br /><br />This March, the US and Libya began working to find a way to speed compensation for families of Americans who were killed by acts of terrorism authorized by the Libyan government. An agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-reaches-settlement-on-libya-terror.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in August. The settlement is seen as a way to normalize relations between the US and Libya and to allow Libya to accelerate development of its oil resources.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081009-1.html">executive order</a> [text; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081009-4.html">press briefing</a>] on Thursday that creates a Transition Coordinating Council to head up transition efforts of executive agencies and the incoming administration in the months leading up to the presidential change early next year. The Council, among other things, will:<blockquote>assist the major party candidates and the President-elect by making every reasonable effort to facilitate the transition between administrations. This assistance may include, among other things, providing information relevant to facilitating the personnel aspects of a presidential transition and such other information that, in the Council&#39;s judgment, is useful and appropriate, as long as providing such information is not otherwise prohibited by law.</blockquote>The Order also directs executive departments and agencies to prepare briefing materials for the new political appointees before inauguration day, and directs the Bush administration to work with the incoming transition team to provide these materials. The Order is set to expire on February 20, 2009, one month after the incoming president is inaugurated. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hTd3qvgQlBCxKb-cwDglA9A9SJTAD93N1KNG0">more</a>.<br /><br />Many US politicians have urged more coordination between government agencies, the outgoing Bush administration, and both major party candidates, especially in the area of national security. This election will be the first time that presidential leadership has changed both since the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and the formation of the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] in 2003.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand&#39;s Court of Appeal Thursday reduced insurrection charges against nine <a href="http://www.padnet.net/">People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy</a> (PAD) [advocacy website, in Thai] activists following this week&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7658245.stm">violent clashes between police and PAD protesters</a> [BBC report]. The court dismissed treason charges against the PAD members as groundless, but maintained the lesser charges of inciting public disturbance and illegal assembly. A spokesman for PAD was quoted in media reports as maintaining that he and his colleagues would now turn themselves into the authorities. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7660473.stm">more</a>; China&#39;s Xinhua News Agency has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/09/content_10171094.htm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The protests were triggered by opposition to the new Thai government led by <a href="http://www.thaigov.go.th/eng/pageconfig/viewcontent/viewcontent1.asp?pageid=467&directory=1944&contents=1641">Somchai Wongsawat</a> [official profile], who took over as prime minister earlier this month after the <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> ruled that then-prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] had <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-high-court-ousts-pm-for.php">violated the constitution</a> [JURIST report] by accepting payment for his appearance on a television cooking program. Somchai is the brother-in-law of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in military coup in 2006. Critics claim that Somchai is just a proxy for Thaksin, who remains in exile while being tried in absentia for corruption.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA3LTQ2NTItY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/07-4652-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl59a8/2/hilite">adopted a fact-specific test</a> [opinion, PDF] for determining whether a disabled student has been placed in the &#39;least restrictive environment&#39; as required by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:h.1350.enr:">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (IDEA) [text]. A three-judge panel explicitly endorsed the two-pronged fact-specific test that the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsulaw.nova.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fsyllabi%2FObertiCase2.doc&ei=DDDuSMTvNJK2esyB8bcH&usg=AFQjCNEUpwEY0tUw4DI6_plJzbVoUZUJyw&sig2=4jQDBxU0vpf5Mu2ceBPWqg">adopted in 1993</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Oberti v. Clementon School District</span> decision, DOC], holding: <blockquote>A court should consider, first, whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of supplemental aids and services, can be achieved satisfactorily for a given child, and, if not, then whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate...<br /><br />Courts facing these cases must engage in an individualized and fact-specific inquiry into the nature of the student&#39;s condition and the school&#39;s particular efforts to accommodate it, ever mindful of the IDEA&#8217;s purpose of educating children with disabilities, &#39;to the maximum extent appropriate,&#39; together with their non-disabled peers...Moreover, courts must keep in mind our deferential position with respect to state educational authorities crafting educational policy...Nevertheless our review must be searching, and we must recognize that even when educational authorities act with the best intentions they may sometimes fall short of their obligations under the IDEA, and courts must then act to ensure compliance with Congress&#8217;s directives.</blockquote>Since IDEA was <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/bush-signs-disabilities-education-bill.php">signed into law in 2004</a> [JURIST report], several of its provisions have been tested in the federal courts of appeals. In August, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-school-policy-on.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/322CE42BE43DDBB7882574AA00020021/$file/0755469.pdf?openelement">opinion</a>, PDF] a California public school district&#39;s policy that parents may only observe their disabled children in the classroom for twenty minutes in order to evaluate the school&#39;s proposed education plan. Earlier that month, the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/tenth-circuit-dismisses-claim-school.php">found that a district court erred</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/07/07-2133.pdf">opinion</a>, PDF] when it refused to grant qualified immunity to school officials who placed a child in a special education program designed to control his repeated outbursts. In 2007, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/supreme-court-rules-in-telecom.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that a parent of a special needs child - and not just the special needs child - has independent, enforceable rights under IDEA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/press/79/Media_Alert_final_8_Oct_2008.doc">announced</a> [press release] that the first trial of a former <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] leader is unlikely to take place until next year. The case of <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek-Eav</a> [TrialWatch backgrounder; court <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/pre-trial_chamber.aspx">materials</a>], also known as Duch, is expected to be delayed as prosecutors challenge a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/cambodia-chamber-indicts-former-khmer.php">closing order</a> [JURIST report] issued by the investigation judges. According to a statement released by the court, <blockquote>[s]uccessfully conducting trials of this significance is a complex process, and the Court recognizes that it can be frustrating for the millions who have been waiting for decades to see justice done. Nevertheless, each step of the legal process must be followed carefully, and conducted in line with the highest standards of justice. This will also ensure the most enduring legacy for the Cambodian Courts. </blockquote>The court said its Pre-Trial Chamber would likely issue a decision on the closing order in December, at which time the case will be transferred to the Trial Chamber. The court also said a trial-management meeting is expected in mid-January, when an initial hearing date will be set. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvefhsGQrWJWMLF8M232dPw8V5PQ">more</a>. <br /><br />Duch is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/cambodia-chamber-indicts-former-khmer.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with crimes against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions. The ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">plans to try as many as eight suspects</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the Khmer Rouge regime, which is generally held responsible for the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">genocide of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] between 1975 and 1979. In June, court officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-aims-to.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] to complete operations a year early because of limited funding but said they would still be able to prosecute all the suspects. In February, a Cambodian genocide survivor <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/first-khmer-rouge-victim-testifies-in.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/cambodia/diary10.html">Nuon Chea</a> [PBS backgrounder] at a pretrial hearing, marking the first time a victim has taken the stand against a former Khmer Rouge official.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan Justice Minister Abdel-Basit Sabdarat said Monday that a special prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">named</a> [JURIST report] to investigate and try war crimes suspects from the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive] has almost completed reports on some crimes in the region, though a time frame for trials has not yet been established. Sabdarat did specify that militia commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ali_kushayb_622.html">Ali Kushayb</a> [TrialWatch profile; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-05-01-07-3-Corr_English.pdf">arrest warrant</a>, PDF], wanted by the ICC on suspicion of 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, will be among those tried by the country&#39;s war crimes tribunal. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] in The Netherlands currently handles such proceedings, but if Sudanese domestic courts are created with appropriate human rights and accountability safeguards, the ICC is required to hand over jurisdiction under Article 16 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/transitpage.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] has <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&num=79918990C19070304&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET&where=()">broadly interpreted</a> [judgment; ECJ <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-304/07">materials</a>] rules protecting the content of databases from copying, regardless of how the information is extracted from its source. The court was considering a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.uni-freiburg.de/index_en.php">University of Freiburg</a> (UF) [university website] against  <a href="http://www.digitale-bibliothek.de/">Direct Media Publishing</a> (DMP) [official website, in German] for selling data CDs with a list of poems virtually identical to one created by the university.  UF had argued that, because of its significant investment in the compilation of the list, its contents was protected under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0009:EN:HTML">Article 7 of Directive 96/9 of the European Parliament</a>&nbsp;[text]. DMP had argued that even if it had used the information, doing so was not prohibited by the Directive because the data could have been referenced and reproduced rather than digitally copied.  The court held Friday that the means of copying the information was immaterial, and that instead the test was whether or not the content had been substantially reproduced:<blockquote>The transfer of material from a protected database to another database following an on?screen consultation of the first database and an individual assessment of the material contained in that first database is capable of constituting an &#8216;extraction&#8217;, within the meaning of Article 7 of Directive 96/9 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, to the extent that &#8211; which it is for the referring court to ascertain &#8211; that operation amounts to the transfer of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively, of the contents of the protected database, or to transfers of insubstantial parts which, by their repeated or systematic nature, would have resulted in the reconstruction of a substantial part of those contents.</blockquote> Out-Law has <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-9497">more</a>.<br /><br />The ECJ last ruled on protections for databases in 2004, when it <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp04/aff/cp040089en.pdf">held</a>&nbsp;[press release] that information taken from a database on race horses did not violate the Directive, because not enough of the information had been copied. On the enforcement of copyright protections, the ECJ in January&nbsp;<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?where=&lang=en&num=79919870C19060275&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET">ruled</a> [judgment; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/eu-court-rules-identity-of-file-sharers.php">report</a>] against <a href="http://www.promusicae.org/">Promusicae</a> [trade website], a Spanish music industry coalition, finding that telecommunication companies have no duty to disclose the names and addresses of people suspected of engaging in illegal file sharing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukrainian president <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Victor Yushchenko</a> [official website] Monday abolished the Kiev District Court by <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/8435.html">decree</a> [decree 922/2008 text, in Ukrainian] after it decided Saturday to block a previous presidential decree dissolving parliament and directing parliamentary elections in the wake of the collapse of the governing coalition. The Kiev court made the ruling against the elections in response to a lawsuit brought by <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/">Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website] against Yushchenko and Ukraine&#39;s <a href="http://www.cvk.gov.ua/">Central Election Commission</a> (CEC) [official website] claiming that the election was called earlier than indicated by law. Monday&#39;s decree establishes two administrative courts to replace the district court. Additionally, Yushchenko issued another <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/8431.html">decree</a> [decree 923/2008 text, in Ukrainian] designed to further safeguard the voting rights of citizens and the vote itself, which is scheduled for December 7. Political allies of Tymoshenko have said they will continue to oppose the elections. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iOAtVWc4V9RgBTgzKzYH3R4q0L7gD93Q61CO0">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20081014/117714613.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Ukraine&#39;s leadership is seriously divided in the wake of the 2004 <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050301faessay84205/adrian-karatnycky/ukraine-s-orange-revolution.html">Orange Revolution</a> [backgrounder] that brought Yushchenko to power as president. The populist Tymoshenko was originally a Yushchenko ally, but more recently has become disaffected, leading to the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11605.html">collapse of the government</a> [press release] over disagreements on both domestic and international issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese People&#39;s Court in Chamdo prefecture sentenced eight Tibetan monks to prison last month, including two to life sentences, according to Tibetan activist group <a href="http://www.freetibet.org/">Free Tibet</a> [advocacy website] Tuesday. The eight monks were <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/china-arrests-9-monks-for-tibet-bombing.php">arrested by Chinese authorities in April</a> [JURIST news archive] in connection with  the March bombing of a government building. The bombing took place during <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7299221.stm">widespread protests against Chinese rule in Tibet</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Free Tibet <a href="http://www.freetibet.org/newsmedia/141008">cited</a> [Free Tibet press release] a &quot;very reliable source in the region,&quot; saying:<blockquote>The legal proceedings against the monks have been shrouded in complete secrecy, according to the source. Normally relatives of the accused would be informed of the nature of the alleged charges, and also of the sentencing. It is also unusual that, in a case concerning an alleged bombing, the sentencing of the convicted is not carried out in a public court.<br /><br />According to the source, the case against the monks has been mounted in the absence of even the most basic level of legal oversight and due process: from the time of arrest to sentencing the monks were denied all access to family and legal counsel; the nature of the charges and the eventual sentencing has not been made public by the court. Relatives of the monks had expected them to be released after the Olympics. Instead the monks were sentenced following the Games, although family relatives were not informed of the sentences. Details of the sentencing had come from an undisclosed contact of the source.</blockquote>Reuters has <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/PEK214674.htm">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jpuzLfvM0fN5Fx68S8r0NIeifBtQD93Q9OHO0">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Chinese officials blamed the <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/">Dalai Lama</a> [personal website], Tibet&#39;s exiled spiritual leader, for the protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. China claimed 19 people died after the skirmishes, but the <a href="http://www.tibet.com/">Tibetan government-in-exile</a> [official website] said that <a href="http://http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/tibet-government-in-exile-says-130.php">130 had died</a> [JURIST report]. The Dalai Lama denied accusations that he was behind the riots and has said that he supports true autonomy for Tibet, not outright independence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_10-14-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call] Monday in three cases, including <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-751.html">Pearson v. Callahan</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#pearson">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-751.htm">07-751</a>, in which the Court will review a July 2007 <a href="http://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/opinions/06/06-4135.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit allowing individuals to directly sue police officers who enter their home without a search warrant to conduct a search and seizure. The Court will consider whether there exists a &quot;consent once removed&quot; exception to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4toc_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [LII materials] that would allow police to enter a home without a warrant when an undercover informant inside the home signals that a drug sale is in progress. Supporting the petitioners during Monday&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-751.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript], Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart said: <blockquote>[O]ur principal contention is ... that once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a government agent into his home, his expectation of privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.... It&#39;s true that the informant here lacked the training and skills that - and integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a police officer to have. But he was for Fourth Amendment purposes a government agent a State actor. </blockquote>Theodore Metzler Jr., arguing on behalf of the respondent, said that &quot;no reasonable officer could have believed&quot; that Callahan had consented to the entry of police by consenting to the entry of a confidential informant. While <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/about/biographiescurrent.pdf">Justice David Souter</a> called the petitioners&#39; view of probable cause &quot;the most astonishing ... I have heard in this courtroom,&quot; <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/about/biographiescurrent.pdf">Justice Samuel Alito</a> [official profiles, PDF] suggested the respondent advocated &quot;a rule that is going to get police officers killed.&quot;<br /><br />In a second criminal procedure case <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-901.pdf">argued</a> [transcript] Monday, <a href="http://www.scotuswiki.com/index.php?title=Oregon_v._Ice">Oregon v. Ice</a> [SCOTUSwiki backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#oregon">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-901.htm">07-901</a>, presenting the question of whether is unconstitutional for a convict to be sentenced to consecutive rather than concurrent terms for burglary and sex offenses when a judge rather than a jury determined that the crimes arose out of separate offenses. The Oregon Supreme Court <a href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S52248.htm">held</a> [opinion text] that the trial court&#39;s imposition of consecutive sentences based on its own fact-finding violated the defendant&#39;s rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6toc_user.html">Sixth Amendment</a> [LII materials].<br /><br />Finally, the Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-689.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-689.html">Bartlett v. Strickland</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/oct08.shtml#bartlett">merit briefs</a>], <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-689.htm">07-689</a>, in which it will consider whether a racial minority group that comprises less than 50 percent of a district&#39;s population can file a vote dilution claim under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00001973----000-.html">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> [text]. The North Carolina Supreme Court <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/sc/opinions/2007/pdf/103-06-1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Act only applies to districts where the minority population constitutes 50 percent or more of voters.

Former PPP deputy leader Yongyuth Tiyapairat was <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090708_News/09Jul2008_news03.php">convicted of organizing a vote-buying scheme</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report] by the court in July, and under Thai law the PPP and associated parties could be banned for connection with the crime. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ag-asks-constitutional-court.php">brought before the court</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) last week after a September <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130268">recommendation</a> [<span style="font-style: italic; ">Bangkok Post</span> report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/thai/default.html">Election Commission</a> [official website, in Thai] to break up the party because of the alleged fraud.

AFP has <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20081014-93704.html">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</span> has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_290367.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The issue comes before the court as the PPP party faces broad public criticism and <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5goXqQzELZD-TQYTEs7cg84gh0Kiw">protests</a> [AFP report] opposing its rule. In late September, the Election Commission said it would <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/300908_News/30Sep2008_news10.php">begin an investigation</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok post</span> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-ruling-party-planning-to-amend.php">report</a>] into allegations that Wongsawat illegally holds stocks in companies which operate under government contracts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush Monday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081013-7.html">signed into law</a> [WH press release] a bill that will provide for additional intellectual property (IP) rights enforcement resources and stronger penalties for violators of those rights. The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s3325enr.txt.pdf">Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008</a> [PDF text; LOC <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.03325:">materials</a>], allows for three times the assessed damages to be awarded against those who counterfeit protected goods, strengthens criminal laws relating to IP infringement, and allows the government broad authority to seize any materials or goods relating to infringement investigations. It also provides additional funding for investigations into alleged infringement and creates a position for an Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, a presidential appointee who would coordinate IP investigations among government agencies. The <a href="http://www.riaa.com/index.php">Recording Industry Association of America</a> [trade website] had <a href="http://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_month_filter=&news_year_filter=&resultpage=&id=2FB888F3-E167-AE4E-98A5-122555B793DF">strongly supported</a> [press release] the bill, saying that it will help protect the interest of copyright holders. Advocacy group <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/1794">criticized</a> [press release] the bill, saying that it will exacerbate problems with existing US IP laws which put too many restrictions on the use of what should be public information. Reuters has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idINIndia-35942320081013?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>. Out-Law has <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-9506">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Other countries are also increasing efforts to expand the scope of protected intellectual property, largely in response to US concerns. In July Canadian <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=071361B9-2D25-4389-A24A-34CC4B1A8535&Language=E">Industry Minister Jim Prentice</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/cmb/welcomeic.nsf/261ce500dfcd7259852564820068dc6d/85256a5d006b9720852574650078b854!OpenDocument">introduced new federal copyright legislation</a> [press release, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-government-introduces-tough.php">report</a>] designed to strengthen penalties against infringement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/101408zor.pdf">rejected a petition</a> [order list, PDF] to hear a Georgia death row inmate&#39;s appeal, lifting a stay on his execution, while agreeing to hear a case dealing with supplemental jurisdiction. The court declined to grant <em>certiorari</em> in the case of <a href="http://www.troyanthonydavis.org/">Troy Anthony Davis</a> [defense website], who was convicted of killing an off-duty police officer in 1989. According to defense lawyers, key witnesses against Davis have recanted their testimony, and others say another person has since confessed to the killing. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-supreme-court-stays-execution-of.php">stayed Davis&#39; execution</a> [JURIST report], which had been <a href="http://law.ga.gov/00/press/detail/0,2668,87670814_87670929_121231342,00.html">scheduled for September</a> [GA AG press release], pending consideration of his case. The <em>certiorari</em> denial lifts that stay, allowing Georgia to set a new execution date. The Court had previously denied a petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the case, and the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] in March <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/docket_search/results_one_record.php?docr_case_num=S07A1758">denied</a> [court docket; <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/op_summaries/mar_17.pdf">opinion summary</a>] Davis&#39;s request for a new trial. The <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em> has <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/10/14/troy_davis_denied.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab">more</a>.<br /><br />In the case granted <em>certiorari</em>, <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-1437.htm">Carlsbad Technology, Inc. v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/officials/pocar-e.htm">Judge Fausto Pocar</a> [official profile], President of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], called Monday for the arrest of Bosnian Serb General <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/CIS-mladic.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials, PDF; amended <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/mla-ai021010e.htm">indictment</a>, PDF] and Croatian Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/hadzic/cis-hadzic.pdf">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY materials, PDF; <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/had-ii040716e.htm">indictment</a>, PDF]. Mladic and Hadzic are the two remaining major fugitives wanted for ICTY prosecution on war crimes charges stemming from their roles as Serbian leaders during the Yugoslavian ethnic conflicts of the 1990s. Both have been in hiding since the end of the conflicts. Pocar&#39;s remarks came during a speech to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] In the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1288e-annex.htm">speech</a> [text], he said:<blockquote> Let me now turn to the second point for which Member State support is essential: the arrest of the remaining fugitives. As you well know, positive developments have taken place during the reporting period. The arrests of Stojan &#381;upljanin and Radovan Karad&#382;i? were particularly important milestones, and we commend the Government of Serbia for the critical cooperation it provided in this respect. However, we cannot successfully accomplish our work if the last two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladi? and Goran Had&#382;i?, are not arrested immediately. I must once again emphasize that while the Tribunal has done its utmost to expeditiously conduct and complete its cases, the late arrests of fugitives, for which the international community must take responsibility, will inevitably lead to slippages in the scheduled end of our proceedings. Thus, while we are ensuring that the trials of the four recently arrested accused will all start in 2009, the arrests of the remaining fugitives might oblige us to push even further our target dates for the completion of all trials.<br /><br />I shall also reiterate that the obligation of all member States of the United Nations to cooperate with the Tribunal pursuant to Article 29 of the Statute are not limited to the arrest of fugitives. This obligation is in fact much wider and also entails the provision of assistance in all aspects of ongoing proceedings before the Tribunal, including access to archives, the production of documents, and access to and protection of witnesses. I must note in this respect preoccupying incidents of witness interference which have occurred during the reporting period, as well as delays in the service of documents, which have affected the expeditious conduct of our proceedings. Finally, State cooperation also entails cooperation in the relocation of witnesses and the enforcement of the Tribunal&#39;s sentences. While the Registry has managed to finalize seven agreements on enforcement of sentences, further support from States is required with respect to relocation of witnesses.</blockquote> AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hVPToomJorjU6HU4u_9ufZWMUVyQD93Q11NG0">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/officials/brammertz-e.htm">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile], the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, told reporters in Serbia Wednesday that he was &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-chief-prosecutor-cautiously.php">cautiously optimistic</a>&quot; [JURIST report] that Mladic and Hadzic would be brought to justice. International pressure for the capture of the two has increased since the July <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>]. In August, Serbian <a href="http://www.predsednik.yu/default.asp?lng=eng">President Boris Tadic</a> [official website] said that his country would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/dnp-serbia-will-fully-cooperate-with.php">fully cooperate with the ICTY</a> [JURIST report] to find and arrest Mladic and Hadzic. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for overseeing the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison massacre and other killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, while Hadzic faces crimes against humanity charges for killings of non-Serbs and for abuses in Croatian prison camps.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/lords/index.cfm">House of Lords</a> on Monday rejected a proposal supported by <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official websites] to increase the amount of time authorities may detain terrorism suspects without charge. The upper house of Parliament voted 309-118 to amend an <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/counterterrorism.html">anti-terrorism bill</a> [materials; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7207659.stm">Q/A</a>] by eliminating a highly contentious provision that would have increased the maximum period for holding uncharged suspects from 28 days to 42. Among the Lords arguing against the extension was former Attorney General <a href="http://www.dodonline.co.uk/engine.asp?lev1=4&lev2=38&menu=81&biog=y&id=26655">Peter Goldsmith</a> [official profile], who had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/uksecurity-labour">written</a> [<em>Guardian</em> op-ed] that the proposal is &quot;wrong in principle and dangerous in practice.&quot; Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=aIwtDPj2SVzQ&refer=uk">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Justice ministers of countries belonging to the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/1550797.stm">profile</a>] said Monday that the International Criminal Court has &#39;no sound legal basis&#39; to issue an arrest warrant for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">news archive</a>]. At a day-long summit in Cairo, the ministers suggested that ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s July <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">application for a warrant to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] was politically motivated and <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28908">denounced</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Sudan Tribune</span> coverage] what they described as &quot;attempts to politicize the principles of international justice.&quot; They applauded recent steps Sudan has taken to prosecute war crimes perpetrators, such as <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">appointing Sudanese prosecutors to investigate and try suspects</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">creation of internationally monitored courts</a> [JURIST reports]. BBC News has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/13/2389133.htm">more</a>; the <span style="font-style:italic;">International Herald Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/12/news/ML-Arabs-Sudan.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Immediately after Moreno-Ocampo applied for an arrest warrant in July, the Arab League <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">rebuked the prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] for his &#8220;unbalanced stance&#8221; and said that an indictment &#8211; the first ever against a sitting head of state &#8211; would set a dangerous and destabilizing precedent. Last month, then-South African President Thabo Mbeki <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-arrest-of-sudan-leader-could.php">spoke out against any ICC arrest of Bashir</a> [JURIST report], telling reporters that the move will jeopardize stability in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. Moreno-Campo <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-prosecutor-making-case-for-sudan.php">traveled to New York</a> last month to seek support for the arrest of Bashir despite the fact that Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">threatened to ignore</a> [JURIST reports] any ICC-issued arrest warrant, saying he would not &quot;deal with or respond to&quot; the ICC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/">British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/decisions/2008/pdf/oct/378_Elmasry_and_Habib_v_Rogers_Publishing_and_MacQueen_(No_4)_2008_BCHRT_378.pdf">dismissed</a> [decision, PDF] a complaint alleging that the Canadian newsmagazine <em><a href="http://www.macleans.ca/">Maclean&#39;s</a></em> [media website] incited hatred toward Muslims. The commission ruled Friday that a 2006 <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20061023_134898_134898">article</a> [text] by conservative writer <a href="http://www.marksteyn.com/">Mark Steyn</a> [personal website] entitled &quot;The future belongs to Islam&quot; did not violate a <a href="http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/Stat/H/96210_01.htm#section7">provision</a> [text] of the British Columbia Human Rights Code that prohibits publication of material &quot;likely to expose a person or a group or class of persons to hatred or contempt.&quot; While noting that the complaint brought by members of the <a href="http://www.canadianislamiccongress.com/">Canadian Islamic Congress</a> [advocacy website] &quot;raises issues of importance to all Canadians,&quot; the commission found that the article&#39;s content did not &quot;rise[] to the level of hatred and contempt.&quot; In its decision, a commission panel wrote: <blockquote>[W]e have determined that, considered in its context, and on the evidence before us, the complainants have not met their burden of demonstrating that the Article rises to the level of detestation, calumny and vilification necessary to breach s. 7(1)(b) of the Code....<br /><br />The Article may attempt to rally public opinion by exaggeration and causing the reader to fear Muslims, but fear is not synonymous with hatred and contempt.<br /><br />We accept that it may be possible to link feelings of fear with hatred and contempt but in the absence of any expert evidence which makes that link in the context of the Article, we cannot find that it was done so in this case.<br /><br />The Article, with all its inaccuracies and hyperbole, has resulted in political debate which, in our view, s. 7(1)(b) was never intended to suppress. In fact, as the evidence in this case amply demonstrates, the debate has not been suppressed and the concerns about the impact of hate speech silencing a minority have not been borne out. </blockquote>Reacting to the decision in a <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MDgyZWRiMTkwYjI3ZWU5YWQyODU1MzJhNzkxMDI0Njk=">blog entry</a> [text], Steyn called the Human Rights Code &quot;ludicrous&quot; and suggested that the commission would have sided against &quot;an obscure Alberta pastor or a guy with a widely unread website,&quot; rather than a prominent media organization. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN1040780420081010">more</a>. The <em>National Post</em> has <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=874166">additional coverage</a>. From Vancouver, the <em>Province</em> has <a href="http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=46aa7a73-3799-46da-9a02-80ac65eb838f">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June, the Canadian Human Rights Commission <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-rights-commission-dismisses.php">dismissed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] against <em>Maclean&#39;s</em>, finding that Steyn&#39;s article did not constitute a discriminatory practice under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/H-6/31435.html">Canadian Human Rights Act</a> [text]. Earlier, a group of Ontario law students filed a complaint against <em>Maclean&#39;s</em> with the <a href="http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en">Ontario Human Rights Commission</a> [official website], which decided it could not refer the allegations to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario because it lacked the jurisdiction to do so under the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90h19_e.htm">Ontario Human Rights Code</a> [text]. The allegations against <em>Maclean&#39;s</em> sparked fierce debate in Canada over the intersection of freedom of the press and the protection of human rights and have drawn sharp criticism from journalists&#39; groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official website] Monday temporarily suspended its travel ban on <a href="http://www.president.gov.by/en/">Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko</a>  [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">profile</a>] and several other Belarussian officials following the first high-level talks between Belarus and the EU in four years.  A <a href="http://www.ue2008.fr/PFUE/lang/en/accueil/PFUE-10_2008/PFUE-13.10.2008/conseil_affaires_generales_et_relations_exterieures">meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg</a> [backgrounder] directed the ban be lifted in an attempt to encourage democratic reform and the improvement of human rights.  Travel restrictions remain in place on four Belarussian officials who were allegedly involved in the disappearance of four opposition leaders in 2000.  Recognizing that Belarus recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/belarus-government-frees-jailed.php">released jailed opposition leader Alexander Kozulin</a> [JURIST report] and other political prisoners, an EU spokesperson was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7667197.stm">quoted</a> [BBC report] by the BBC as saying &#39;We want to show that progress is being rewarded.&#39; Reuters has <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/world/30300">more</a>; EUobserver has <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/26922">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Lukashenko has recently sought to improve his country&#39;s ties with western nations, but EU-imposed sanctions have remained pending the release of all political prisoners, including Kozulin.  While it lifted the travel ban for six months, the EU maintained asset freezes on top Belarussian officials. The <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/us-imposes-travel-ban-on-belarus.php">US imposed its own travel ban on Lukashenko</a> [JURIST report] in May 2006.

		<title>Proposed Ethiopia NGO law would undermine human rights efforts: HRW</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human Rights Watch (HRW) Monday encouraged the Ethiopian parliament to reject the draft <a href="http://www.crdaethiopia.org/Documents/Charities%20and%20Societies%20Legislation%20Draft%20_Revised.pdf">Charities and Societies Proclamation</a> [text, in Amharic], which HRW officials concluded in a <a href="http://hrw.org/pub/2008/africa/HRW.NGO.Law.Analysis.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/13/ethiop19947.htm">press release</a>] would severely undermine human rights efforts in the country if passed. The draft law, which is a revision of the <a href="http://www.crdaethiopia.org/Documents/MoJ%20Draft%20Proclamation%20-%20Complete.pdf">law proposed earlier this year</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ethiopia-proposed-ngo-law-may-undermine.php">report</a>], is designed to regulate civil society organizations (CSOs) in the country. HRW claims that it will instead harm human rights by creating a Charities and Societies Agency with broad authority to interfere in CSO internal workings and to ban any CSO that fails to meet government specifications. According to the report: <blockquote>[T]he intended and actual result of this law would be to make it nearly impossible for any civil society organization to carry out work the government does not approve of. It also contravenes fundamental human rights guaranteed by international law and by Ethiopia&#8217;s constitution. Most notably, the law would criminalize human rights-related work carried out by non-Ethiopian organizations while at the same time making it impossible for domestic human rights organizations to operate with any real degree of effectiveness or independence. ...<br /><br />The current version of the bill remains a blunt tool whose primary impact would be to destroy the already-limited ability of Ethiopian civil society actors to criticize or act independently of the government. It would also result in the de facto criminalization of any and all independent human rights work that seeks to document or challenge the Ethiopian government&#8217;s appalling human rights record.</blockquote> The report also criticizes the proposed law for imposing strict and unregulated criminal and administrative penalties on those who violate its rules. The draft will likely be submitted to the parliament for consideration by the end of the month. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jDXRojmsYedBoe8b3iEDRnCfLc2A">more</a>.<br /><br />Ethiopia&#39;s human rights record has recently come under intense international scrutiny. In June, HRW released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/ethiopia0608/ethiopia0608web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] attacking Ethiopian <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ethiopia-ethnic-separatists-targets-of.php">human rights practices in the Ogaden region</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2007, the US House of Representatives passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:2:./temp/%7Ec110lHCyXp::">Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> (H.R. 2003) [text; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2008/01/linking-rights-and-foreign-aid-for.php">commentary</a>], aimed in part at encouraging the improvement of the human rights situation in Ethiopia. The bill is currently before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In July 2007, HRW accused Ethiopian troops of <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/ethiopia-military-crackdown-on-rebels.php">violating international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report] by burning homes and forcibly relocating civilians in Ogaden. In March 2007, HRW also accused Ethiopia of complicity with the US and Kenya in <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">secretly detaining Somalis</a> [JURIST report] accused of being Islamic militants. Ethiopia had <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/ethiopia-admits-to-detaining-terror.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 that it detained terror suspects but denied that the detentions were secret.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Department of Defense (DOD) released a <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Ruling%20D-035%20US%20v%20Mohammed%20et%20al%20%28Motion%20for%20Resources%29.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] Sunday indicating that Guantanamo detainees who represent themselves at trial are not entitled to Internet access and some computer hardware and software to aid in their defense. Military judge <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ralph+kohlmann">Col. Ralph Kohlmann</a> [JURIST news archive] wrote that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other detainees <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsCo-conspirators.html">charged</a> [DOD materials] with planning the Sept. 11 attacks already had access to writing materials, laptops with word-processing and discovery software, and copies of some military commissions regulations, but also wrote that officials warned the detainees that self-representation could limit the materials available to them: <blockquote>[T]he simple reality of the situation is that there are limits on what the Government must provide to the accused under an umbrella of reasonable access to materials for the preparation of the defense. Reasonable access does not equate to a right or an entitlement to be placed on the same footing as a technologically state of the art law office.</blockquote> Kohlmann denied the detainees&#39; requests for Internet access, PowerPoint, DVD writers, printers, and scanners, but held that the detainees had to have access to defense materials and enough computer power for at least 12 hours a day. Additionally, Kohlman granted the detainees access to the US <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Constitution</a>, the <a href="/gazette/2005/12/detainee-treatment-act-of-2005-white.php">Detainee Treatment Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Geneva Conventions</a> [texts], and a legal dictionary. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCpAiXsS28ctqTC-AqtM0twgv0HQD93P5VEG0">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> [advocacy websites] announced plans to raise more than $8 million to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/34779prs20080403.html">provide private defense attorneys</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/law-groups-to-underwrite-defense-of.php">report</a>] for high-profile detainees, claiming the US military had not provided adequate financing to defend the detainees with the military lawyers appointed to them. Among the detainees chosen by the ACLU and Criminal Defense Lawyers is Mohammed, who has claimed under oath that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-admits-planning.php">planned the 9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST report] and is responsible for 29 other terrorist attacks. In February, the US government announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-to-seek-death-penalty-in-six-911.php">seek the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and five other Guantanamo detainees accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks.

Under China&#39;s <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html">constitution</a> [text], the country&#39;s land is either owned collectively or by the state, but the reforms would give farmers broader autonomy to sell or borrow against their land use rights and establish a financial infrastructure to allow for larger, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-10/13/content_7100244.htm">more efficient farms</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</font> report]. The changes were approved by the party during a plenary session during which the CPC <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/66102/6513760.html">announced plans</a> [Xinhua report] to &quot;eliminate&quot; rural poverty by the year 2020. The Central Committee also <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/13/content_10188827.htm">solicited input from leaders outside of the CPC</a> [Xinhua report] during the session, a move unusual for country&#39;s one-party government. The reforms are expected to be considered by China&#39;s <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/english/home/index.jsp">National People&#39;s Congress</a> [official website] in March. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081012/wl_asia_afp/chinapoliticseconomyparty">more</a>.<br /><br />The Chinese government has recently taken other steps towards a more democratic, capitalist structure, but has continued to face international criticism for alleged rights abuses. In September, the <a href="http://english.gov.cn/links/statecouncil.htm">State Council of China</a> [official website, in English] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/china-regulations-clarify-labor.php">issued regulations</a> [JURIST report] implementing ambiguous provisions of the <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=56338">Labor Contract Law</a> [backgrounder] which was <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/01/business/chilabor.php">viewed as a major advancement</a> [Bloomberg report] for employee rights. Earlier that month, however, <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/">Human Rights in China</a> (HRIC) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision%5fid=84825&item%5fid=84810">release</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/rights-group-china-police-use-torture.php">report</a>] saying that Chinese police and other officials still employ <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=torture">torture</a> [JURIST news archive] to elicit confessions and intimidate political dissidents despite domestic and international bans, and a July <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/089/2008/en/8249b304-5724-11dd-90eb-ff4596860802/asa170892008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-human-rights-abuses-continuing-in.php">report</a>] released by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said the country had failed significantly improve its human rights record.

Encouraged by the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC) [official website], Citigroup agreed earlier this month to <a href="http://www.wachovia.com/inside/page/0,,134_307%5E1803,00.html">buy out Wachovia for $2.1 billion</a> [press release] but was effectively trumped by a Wells Fargo offer of $11.7 billion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Kiev court Saturday blocked a decree by <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Ukrainian President Victor Yushchenko</a> [official website] dissolving parliament and directing parliamentary elections in the wake of the collapse of the governing coalition. The Kiev District Court made the ruling against the elections in response to a lawsuit brought by <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/">Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website] against Yushchenko and Ukraine&#39;s <a href="http://www.cvk.gov.ua/">Central Election Commission</a> (CEC) [official website] claiming that the election was called earlier than indicated by law. Media sources Sunday quoted Kiev Prosecutor Yevheniy Blazhyvsky as saying that the lower court judge who first ordered a block on Friday would be charged with knowingly commiting an unlawful act. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20081012/117689660.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Ukraine&#39;s leadership is seriously divided in the wake of the 2004 <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050301faessay84205/adrian-karatnycky/ukraine-s-orange-revolution.html">Orange Revolution</a> [backgrounder] that brought Yushchenko to power as president. The ambitious and highly populist Tymoshenko was originally a Yushchenko ally, but more recently has become disaffected, leading to the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11605.html">collapse of the government</a> [press release] over disagreements on a variety of domestic and international issues.

The changes to the <a href="http://www.pbbarcouncil.com/downloads/barcouncil_act_amended_2005.pdf">Legal Practitioners Act of 1973</a> [text, PDF] would undo an <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/musharraf-ready-to-meet-most-opposition.php">amendment</a> [JURIST report] to the Act promulgated by former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] following his November 3, 2007 declaration of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+emergency">emergency rule</a> [JURIST news archive]. In particular, they would reduce the power of superior court judges appointed by the government to discipline and even disbar lawyers for &quot;professional or other misconduct.&quot; The establishment of a National Human Rights Commission is intended to bring Pakistan in compliance with a UN General Assembly resolution requiring members to set up official human rights bodies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Moscow District Military Court opened closed preliminary hearings Wednesday on the killing of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Politkovskaya">news archive</a>]. The hearings began without prominent human rights lawyer Karina Moskalenko, who is representing Politkovskaya&#39;s family, because the lawyer fell ill Wednesday, giving rise to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4954795.ece"> suspicions that she was poisoned</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">London Times</span> report], possibly by mercury later found in her car. The trial judge rejected an argument by the Politkovskaya family to stay the hearing until Moskalenko could be present. The actual trial of the three men accused in the murder is scheduled to begin on November 17. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49E5QT.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Sergey Khadzhikurbanov and brothers Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, all from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chechnya">Chechnya</a> [JURIST news archive], were <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ten-arrested-in-death-of-russia.php">arrested last August</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the inquiry into Politkovskaya&#39;s murder. The main suspect, Rustam Makhmudov, also from Chechnya, has yet to be captured but Russian authorities have said he is hiding in Western Europe. In May, Makhmudov was <a href="http://www.mnweekly.ru/national/20080515/55328660.html">charged <span style="font-style: italic;">in absentia</span></a> [<em>Moscow News</em> report] and an international warrant for his arrest was issued. Politkovskaya, a reporter for the Russian newspaper <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/">Novaya Gazeta</a> [media website, in Russian], was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/russia-top-prosecutor-probing-murder.php">shot</a> [JURIST report] in the head and chest after returning to her Moscow apartment building in October 2006.

Story informant Lieutenant-Colonel Dinh Van Huynh was sentenced to one year in prison for &quot;deliberately revealing state secrets,&quot; and retired policeman General Pham Xuan Quac was reprimanded for providing information to the press.  The sentencing judge said that <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5id8yU6vX0PBggXj2gDg8YnRe5Epg">&quot;hostile forces, reactionaries and political opportunists&quot; exploited the PMU 18 scandal</a> [AFP report] to criticize the Vietnamese government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A commission <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-president-appoints-commission-to.php">established</a> to investigate the political and ethnic violence that followed Kenya&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">disputed December 2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST reports] <a href="http://www.communication.go.ke/media.asp?id=738&media_type=2">released</a> [press release] a <a href="http://www.communication.go.ke/media.asp?id=739">report</a> [PDF] on Wednesday recommending the establishment of an international tribunal to try suspected perpetrators. The Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence cited &#8220;systematic attacks on Kenyans based on their ethnicity and their political leanings&#8221; and criticized the state security apparatus for &#8220;fail[ing] institutionally to anticipate, prepare for, and contain the violence.&#8221; In some instances, law enforcement officers are suspected of having committed acts of violence and gross violations of human rights. Justice Philip Waki, the head of the commission, requested that a tribunal be established within the territorial boundaries of Kenya with the mandate to prosecute crimes &#8211; &#8220;particularly crimes against humanity&#8221; &#8211; relating to the 2007 general election. The &#8220;Special Tribunal for Kenya,&#8221; as it is termed in the report, is to be composed of Kenyan and international judges and will apply both Kenyan and international law.<br /><br />Notably absent from the commission&#8217;s report are the names of the suspected culprits. According to Waki, the commission has evidence of involvement by prominent politicians, government officials, and businessmen in Kenya but has postponed disclosures to prevent the sabotage and adulteration of evidence. The commission is expected to deliver the names in a sealed envelope to <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kofi+annan">news archive</a>], who helped mediate the current power-sharing agreement between Kenya&#39;s ruling party and opposition, as early as this Friday. VOA has <a href="">more</a>.<br /><br />In March the Kenyan parliament approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kenya-opposition-threatens-protests.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] between <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] and opposition leader <a href="http://www.raila2007.com/cms2/">Raila Odinga</a> [campaign profile] intended to end the post-election violence which had sparked simmering ethnic tensions in the country. Human Rights Watch reported that over 1,000 people were killed and 500,000 displaced in weeks of protests and rioting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US insurance giant <a href="http://www.aigcorporate.com/corpsite/index.html">American International Group</a> (AIG) [corporate website] is lobbying state governments to relax strict, recently enacted rules designed to provide greater oversight of the mortgage lending industry, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported Thursday. The rules are contained in the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s2595is.txt.pdf">S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008</a> [text, PDF], which was signed into law by President Bush at the end of July. The Act requires mortgage originators to be registered and licensed by state agencies. As part of the registration and licensing process, originators are required to undergo background checks, including fingerprint analysis by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website], personal history checks, credit reporting, and investigation of originator&#39;s civil and criminal records. The Act also requires originators to undergo training on federal law and regulations, ethics, and lending standards for subprime mortgages, and to be tested on those subjects. According to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, AIG has been lobbying states to ease some of the state-imposed rules associated with the Act. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE49F0X620081016">more</a>.<br /><br />AIG was the recipient of an $85 billion bridge loan from the US <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/default.htm">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] due to financial instability due to subprime lending and the financial derivatives and mortgage-backed securities markets. Additionally, many current and former AIG executives <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sec-begins-accounting-rules-review-as.php">blame the company&#39;s troubles on &quot;mark-to-market&quot; accounting rules</a> [JURIST report]. The $85 billion bridge loan is intended to allow AIG time to sell off its assets in an orderly fashion in order to avoid the negative consequences of a bankruptcy or collapse during the current financial crisis. The bridge loan is intended to act in concert with the recently-passed <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">$700 billion rescue bill</a> [JURIST report] to limit the effects of the crisis on the larger US economy and international markets. Last month, members of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-congress-considers-legislative.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] regulatory changes and investigations following a stock market drop propelled by Lehman Brothers&#39; Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the sale of Merrill Lynch.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush on Tuesday signed a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h928enr.txt.pdf">bill</a> [HR 928 text, PDF] designed to further insulate federal inspectors general (IGs) from political interference. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 is the latest in a series of amendments to the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sup_05_5_10_sq2.html">Inspector General Act of 1978</a> [text], which created the oversight offices within executive agencies. The new law establishes requirements for qualification and appointment of IGs and limits the conditions of their removal. It provides, in part, that <blockquote>[e]ach Inspector General shall be appointed without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations. </blockquote>In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081014-7.html">signing statement</a> [text], however, Bush formally objected to provisions giving IGs the right to obtain independent counsel and requiring budgetary disclosure of IG requirements as separate submissions, on the grounds that they improperly limit his constitutional authority as the head of the executive branch. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJz0g6UQlruxlCgOfHfrtLfXgRLAD93QIB7G0">more</a>.<br /><br />Last October, Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/110-1/hr928sap-r.pdf">expressed concern</a> [WH policy statement, PDF] about imposing limitations on IG dismissal and about establishing an independent oversight committee because a similar committee had already been established by executive order. Concern about the independence and efficacy of inspectors general has been prompted by recent disclosures of impropriety at the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=interior+department">news archive</a>], allegations of misconduct by former Attorney General <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/gonzales-bio.html">Alberto Gonzales</a> [WH profile; JURIST news archive] and questionable <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-report-says-officials-employed.php">hiring practices</a> [JURIST report] at the <a href="http://www.doj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two classified memos sent from the Bush administration to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 explicitly sanctioned the use of certain harsh interrogation techniques, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboard">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], the <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403331.html">reported</a> [text] Wednesday. The documents were reportedly first requested by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3774157.stm">then-CIA director George Tenet</a> [BBC profile; SourceWatch <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/wiki.phtml?title=George_John_Tenet">profile</a>] in 2003 at a meeting with members of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/">National Security Council</a> [official website], as Tenet hoped that a written statement of the administration&#39;s policy would offer legal protection for CIA subordinates. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span> report&#39;s sources, four anonymous Bush administration and intelligence officials, confirmed that a brief memo approving the use of the techniques was sent shortly after the meeting, and that a second memo confirming the policy was sent in 2004 despite growing concerns from the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The memos remain classified. The White House has not commented on the story. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hIOxnategmc4W0QOt8Dv7cghWgKA">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/41252.htm">Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice</a> [official profile] became the first White House official to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092403355.html?hpid=sec-nation">acknowledge that the Bush administration held talks</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report] as early as 2002 to consider the legality of waterboarding and other coercive techniques. <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/top-white-house-officials-approved.php">Reports</a> [JURIST report] in April alleged that top Bush officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, approved the use of controversial interrogation methods on terrorism suspects. In February, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/doj-investigating-cia-waterboarding.php">launched an internal probe</a> [JURIST report] into whether top department officials improperly approved the CIA&#39;s use of waterboarding. The DOJ released three <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36104res20080724.html">memos</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/enhanced-interrogation-techniques-can.php">report</a>] in July indicating that certain harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, are lawful and that those who employ them in good faith lack the specific intent required to be charged with torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Judge Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] Thursday ordered the exhumation of 19 mass graves in Spain, launching an investigation into the disappearances of tens of thousands of people beginning in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882902">Spanish Civil War</a> [BBC backgrounder], and continuing through the early years of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco&#39;s dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In a 68-page <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200810/16/espana/20081016elpepunac_4_Pes_PDF.doc">writ</a> [PDF text, in Spanish], Garzon argued the mass disappearances constitute crimes against humanity. He expanded the investigation to include all members of Spain&#39;s Board of National Defense who served from July, 18, 1936, and all members of the first five governments headed by Franco until July 18, 1951. Garzon is unlikely to find any living suspects to charge, however. Franco himself died in 1975 at the age of 82. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jwMqZMBFgUT-1WovIPfURB5871swD93RNQV80">more</a>. From Madrid, <em>El Pais</em> has <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Garzon/investigara/represion/franquista/abrira/fosa/Lorca/elpepuesp/20081016elpepunac_6/Tes">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />In 2007, the Spanish Parliament <a href="http://www.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&id=2007/22296">passed legislation</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/spain-lower-house-passes-bill.php">report</a>] condemning the Franco government, acknowledging the victims and setting aside money to compensate them. Garzon, widely known for his high-profile investigations of terror and human rights cases, previously called for the <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/spanish-judge-calls-for-franco-truth.php">creation of a &quot;truth commission&quot;</a> [JURIST report] to uncover Franco-era abuses. In September, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">began an investigation</a> [JURIST report] to assemble a definitive registry of the tens of thousands of victims of the Spanish Civil War and the Franco regime. Garzon ordered government agencies, the Spanish <a href="http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/">Episcopal Conference</a> [church website], the <a href="http://www.ugr.es/ugr/index.php">University of Granada</a> [academic website] and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. Estimates of the number of people killed during the 1936-39 Civil War and the subsequent Franco dictatorship range from 90,000 to 180,000.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The FBI is investigating allegations of voter registration fraud involving the <a href="http://www.acorn.org/">Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now</a> (ACORN) [advocacy website] ahead of the November presidential election. According to senior law enforcement officials quoted by AP Thursday, the FBI is analyzing evidence gathered from <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hvb0LfZQ5mY-X8PYSvYxTe3QGgdgD93LVDS80">recent raids of ACORN state headquarters</a> [AP report] to determine whether there is a nationwide effort to commit systematic voter fraud. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hSQRQM34d7S1eOAiEdP7GAxlwf_QD93RQUJO1">more</a>.<br /><br />ACORN workers engaged in a nationwide <a href="http://acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=22364&tx_ttnews[backPid]=12346&cHash=5b24b1c9dd">voter registration drive</a> [press release] enrolling more than 1.3 million new voters in 21 states have been accused of submitting fraudulent voter registration forms in several of those states. Earlier this month reports surfaced that a majority of the 5,000 registration forms submitted to board of elections officials by Acorn employees in Lake County, Indiana were <a href="http://www.nwi.com/articles/2008/10/02/news/lake_county/doc5399904569d23a75862574d600010e55.txt">false or fraudulent</a> [<em>Northwest Indiana Times</em> report]. The registration forms submitted in the county included a Jimmy John&#39;s restaurant, members of the Dallas Cowboys, and several deceased persons. ACORN has <a href="http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=22383&tx_ttnews[backPid]=12340&cHash=ef14f35f55">vigorously denied</a> [press release] the voter fraud allegations against it and says they are part of a politicized effort by Republicans to &quot;create an unfounded specter of voter fraud and to suppress voting.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge on the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/">Constitutional Court of Italy</a> [official website, in Italian] on Wednesday suspended the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Italy+CIA">trial of 26 Americans</a> [JURIST news archive] and five former Italian intelligence officials for the 2003 abduction and <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of Egyptian cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasr+egyptian+cleric">Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive] to consider whether to compel a witness to answer questions that may implicate state secrets. During cross-examination in a closed session, Italian intelligence agent Giuseppe Scandone <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/15/europe/EU-Italy-CIA-Trial.php">refused to respond</a> [AP report] when defense lawyers for former <a href="http://www.serviziinformazionesicurezza.gov.it/pdcweb.nsf/pagine/ee_homepage">Italian Intelligence and Security Service</a> (SISMI) [official website] chief Nicolo Pollari asked if Pollari had ever ordered subordinates to carry out the extraordinary rendition of a terror suspect. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/redazione/cmsSezioni/politica/200810articoli/37342girata.asp">submitted a letter</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Stampa</span> report, in Italian] to the intelligence officials before the hearing Wednesday arguing that though discussion of the relationship between Italy and foreign intelligence services may reveal state secrets, Pollari&#39;s defense team may be able to continue with their questioning. Judge Oscar Magi is expected to confirm with the government whether a reply from Scandone would implicate classified national security information before the trial reconvenes on October 22. AKI has <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=3.0.2591918101">more</a>.<br /><br />Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt&#39;s State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. Defense lawyers for Pollari have said they need Italian agents&#39; testimony and classified government documents to assert their defense that Pollari was not involved in the kidnapping. In May, Magi ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/italty-court-rules-berlusconi-can-be.php">Berlusconi can be called to testify</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An urgent effort by the Bush administration to transfer 17 Guantanamo detainees outside the US has stalled as a result of a bitter interagency dispute, according to a <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> report on Wednesday. Last week, US District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1310-41">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] the 17 <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16870/">Chinese Muslim Uighurs</a> [backgrounder] held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to be released in the United States. The judge found that after the government dropped its claim that the Uighurs were &#8220;enemy combatants,&#8221; there was no longer a legal basis for continuing their confinement at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST news archive]. The decision marked the first instance a court had ordered that prisoners from Guantanamo be released onto US soil and provoked an immediate outcry from the Bush administration. The <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] responded by filing seven separate appeals on the release issue, and the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit temporarily <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/us-stay-motion-10-10-08.pdf">blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] Urbina&#8217;s action. Some critics have suggested that the Justice Department&#8217;s filings, which describe the Uighurs as &#8220;a danger to the public,&#8221; have compromised diplomatic efforts undertaken by the <a href="www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] to resettle the detainees in other countries. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/washington/16gitmo.html?ref=us">more</a>. <br /><br />Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other advocacy organizations have urged the government <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20081009002&lang=e">not to drag its feet in freeing the detainees</a> [AI press release]. The Bush administration continues to resist requests from the Chinese government to repatriate the Uighurs, fearing they would be tortured upon return to the remote northwestern province of Xinjiang. But since transferring five Uighur detainees to Albania in 2006, it had been unable to persuade governments to accept others.

		<title>Draft Iraq status of forces pact authorizes Iraqi trials of US troops for crimes off base</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US and Iraqi negotiators Wednesday agreed on a draft for a <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">Status of Forces Agreement</a> [CFR materials] that gives Iraqi courts limited jurisdiction over American military personnel. According to Iraqi officials quoted by AP Wednesday, the draft agreement requires US troops to face trial before Iraqi courts for major crimes committed off base when the troops are not on an authorized mission. The US would retain the right to prosecute troops and private contractors for crimes committed on base and while troops are on authorized missions. The current draft agreement will likely face resistance in the US Congress, where many lawmakers are wary of subjecting American troops to any foreign judicial jurisdiction. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-5dqDuZE7oT9VMPBDYPeWO14ZkQD93R86T00">more</a>.<br /><br />The draft agreement has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] by months of negotiation. If passed by lawmakers in each country, it will extend the role of US forces in Iraq through 2011. The current UN mandate authorizing a US troop presence in Iraq <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">expires in December</a> [UN press release]. In late June, the US agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/private-contractors-in-iraq-may-be.php">eliminate legal immunity for US contractors</a> [JURIST report] from the proposed agreement, and suggested that it might concede US control of Iraqi airspace. The US continued to push for immunity for US troops from prosecution in Iraqi courts and the right to hold detainees independent of Iraqi review.

Appearing on behalf of the petitioner during Wednesday&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-772.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF], Washington State Deputy Solicitor General William B. Collins noted that the federal <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/aedpa.pdf">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [PDF text] provides a deferential standard of review and urged the Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit because &quot;the Washington court&#39;s adjudication of this matter was not objectively unreasonable.&quot; Jeffrey Fisher, arguing on behalf of the respondent, said the &quot;extraordinary record&quot; in the case demonstrates that the Washington Court of Appeals &quot;could not have reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.&quot;<br /><br />In the second case <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-544.pdf">argued</a> [transcript, PDF] Wednesday, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-544.html">Hedgpeth v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/newopn.pl">Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0374p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court order requiring Ohio&#39;s secretary of state to establish a system that allows county elections boards to confirm newly registered voters&#39; eligibility. The court, sitting <em>en banc</em>, vacated a <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hUHafp1cxJ8ULtxqbf9fo0lw-pegD93O3JGO0">stay</a> [AP report] imposed by a Sixth Circuit panel last week. The temporary restraining order issued by the district court gives <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner</a> [official website] until Friday to furnish county elections officials with lists of prospective voters whose information in state databases contains discrepancies, or to provide the officials with access to the statewide voter registration database so they can resolve the discrepancies. An anti-fraud <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/15483.html#a">provision</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) [FEC materials] requires state election and motor vehicles officials to match information between their databases to ensure voter eligibility. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=3010">Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton</a> [official profile] wrote on behalf of the Sixth Circuit majority: <blockquote>[O]ne of the key obstacles to the Secretary&#8217;s request for relief is the lack of any affidavit or other factual support for her arguments that altering the relevant computer programs will be difficult or will create material risks to other aspects of the election process. In upholding the district court&#39;s October 10 order and its October 17 deadline, it is appropriate to assume what we should always assume in denying interim relief&#8212;that the district court will respond fairly to requests to adjust the TRO if the Secretary offers reasonable bases for doing so. </blockquote>In a <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/PressReleases/2008%20Press%20Releases/20081014.aspx">statement</a> [text], Brunner said her office would &quot;work with the federal court, even though we believe that the order goes beyond the requirements of HAVA.&quot; Robert Bennett, chairman of the <a href="http://ohiogop.org/">Ohio Republican Party</a> [party website], called the Sixth Circuit decision &quot;a victory for the integrity of Ohio&#39;s election&quot; but <a href="http://ohiogop.org/press/articles/2008/10/statement-chairman-bennett-regarding-decision-6th-u-s-circuit-court-appeals">noted</a> [press release] that it leaves &quot;little time for election officials to act on questionable registrations.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hrw7GYLN4qc4DPNrrALrPgO_pRPAD93QS5400">more</a>. The <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> has <a href="http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/10/15/copy/CHECK_FRAUD.ART_ART_10-15-08_A1_0KBJT68.html?adsec=politics&sid=101">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />Last week, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states, including Ohio, had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/voters-illegally-removed-from-rolls-in.php">removed from voter rolls</a> [JURIST] against federal voting law. The <em>Times</em> article found that elections officials had violated HAVA by cross-checking voter rolls with lists from the Social Security Administration before using information from other sources, as required by the statute. Voters and advocacy groups have challenged Ohio elections procedures since the state&#39;s pivotal role in the 2004 presidential campaign. Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ohio-to-proceed-with-absentee-voting.php">rejected GOP challenges</a> [JURIST report] to a directive by Brunner allowing allowing a one-week overlap before the end of voter registration and after the beginning of absentee balloting. Also last month, a federal district judge entered a temporary restraining order allowing observers to be present when absentee voters cast ballots in person, but that order was <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0355p-06.pdf">stayed</a> [opinion, PDF] by a Sixth Circuit panel. The same panel denied the Ohio Republican Party&#39;s motion for an injunction requiring that absentee ballots cast by newly registered voters be segregated from other ballots.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE23/027/2008/en/dc425c41-8bb9-11dd-8e5e-43ea85d15a69/mde230272008en.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/saudi-arabia-executions-target-foreign-nationals-20081014">press release</a>] issued Tuesday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] links the large number of executions in <a href="/countries/saudi.php">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST news archive] to flaws in the Saudi judicial system. The report, titled <em>Affront to Justice: Death Penalty in Saudi Arabia</em>, noted a significant increase in executions from 2006 to 2007, when at least 158 death sentences were carried out, and a relatively high rate of execution for migrant or foreign workers. Malcolm Smart, director of AI&#39;s Middle East and North Africa program, said: <blockquote>The government&#39;s continuing high use of the death penalty runs counter to the growing international trend towards abolition. Moreover, the death penalty is carried out disproportionately and discriminately on national or ethnic grounds against poor foreign workers and against Saudi Arabian nationals who lack the family or other connections that, fortunately, help others to be saved from execution. </blockquote>The AI report pointed to several factors contributing to the high execution rate, including the closed nature of the Saudi judicial process, the imposition of the death penalty for relatively minor offenses and a lack of legal assistance for the accused. The <a href="http://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/portal">Saudi Interior Ministry</a> [official website] announced Tuesday that two more convicts had been beheaded, bringing the number of executions this year to at least 72, as a court <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=115417&d=14&m=10&y=2008">sentenced three Sri Lankans to death</a> [<em>Arab News</em> report] for armed robbery and murder. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jS2InIBNEH93JYJZJZ5K-P21lhqgD93QE6JG2">more</a>. <br /><br />In a report released earlier this year, AI found that Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-1200-people-executed-worldwide-in.php">executed more people per capita than any other nation</a> [JURIST report]. According to that report, at least 1,252 people were put to death in 24 countries, with Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Pakistan and the United States accounting for the vast majority of the executions. In July, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report criticizing a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">lack of legal protections</a> [JURIST report] for the 1.5 million migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia. Among other proposed reforms, HRW called on the Saudi government to amend the 2005 Labor Law to cover migrant workers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14801.pdf?PHPSESSID=7907e506034b85352c378e5ed7f52ab5">rejected</a> [decision text, PDF; <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14803.pdf">press release</a>, PDF; case <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=GR&case=140&k=4d">docket</a>] an emergency request for provisional measures from the Georgian Republic to stop the alleged killing and mass displacement of citizens in the breakaway regions of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">South Ossetia and Abkhazia</a> [JURIST news archive], instead calling on both Georgia and Russia to meet their obligations under the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD)[text]. The Court determined that it possessed <span style="font-style:italic;">prima facie</span> jurisdiction over the case under CERD Article 22, but opted to use its <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&p2=2&p3=0">power to indicate provisional measures</a> [ICJ Article 41 text] to reach each side: <blockquote>Both Parties, within South Ossetia and Abkhazia and adjacent areas in Georgia, shall<br />(1) refrain from any act of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions;<br />(2) abstain from sponsoring, defending or supporting racial discrimination by any persons or organizations,<br />(3) do all in their power, whenever and wherever possible, to ensure, without distinction as to national or ethnic origin,<br />(i) security of persons;<br />(ii) the right of persons to freedom of movement and residence within the border of the State;<br />(iii) the protection of the property of displaced persons and of refugees;<br />(4) do all in their power to ensure that public authorities and public institutions under their control or influence do not engage in acts of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions.</blockquote> The ruling, which created an international legal obligation with which Russia and Georgia must comply, also called on both sides to facilitate humanitarian assistance in the disputed regions and to refrain from any action which might prejudice the rights of the other party. AFP has <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1638f3b6-3926-4353-ab9a-58de22ce41f0">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20081015/117756192.html">additional coverage.</a><br /><br />Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">instituted</a> [JURIST report] the case in August after Russia sent its military into Georgia in response to a Georgian bid to strike the breakaway South Ossetia region, heavily populated with Russians. Last month Georgia <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14727.pdf">sought</a> [ICJ press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-presents-argument-against.php">report</a>] emergency orders from the ICJ, arguing that Russia is engaged in ethnic cleansing and has violated the CERD by removing ethnic Georgians from the territories. Russia countered that its military actions have saved lives, and that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction over the case. In August, Russia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">instituted its own action</a> [JURIST report] against Georgia in the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cpi.int%2Fhome.html%26l%3Den&ei=kmPISOjjEYXGeoCazLgB&usg=AFQjCNGJUlA-BRBuc2s6fmrrdvGtRbGqdQ&sig2=tFj3pq19L_qpG_9Z8NSGpQ">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], alleging that Georgia committed war crimes against ethnic Russians in South Ossetia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/ozgecmis.asp?id=432">Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin</a> [party profile, in Turkish] apologized Tuesday on behalf of the Turkish government for the death of Engin Ceber, an anti-government protester who died after alleged torture while in police custody on Saturday. Sahin also announced that 19 prison officials were suspending pending an investigation into Cerber&#39;s death. The <em>Guardian</em> quoted Sahin as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/15/turkey-humanrights">saying</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]:<blockquote>&quot;I apologise to the relatives of [Ceber] on behalf of my government and the state ... I am pushing this ahead with a high sensitivity. The number [of suspensions] could rise as the investigation widens. I am very sorry that such an incident was allowed to happen in Turkey at such a time.&quot;</blockquote> According to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], Cerber was <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/turkey-death-following-police-detention-20081010">arrested nearly two weeks ago</a> [AI press release] while protesting the shooting death of another activist last year, and was brought to an Istanbul prison, where he was allegedly subjected to torture and severe beatings. He was taken to a hospital last week, where he later died. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7670678.stm">more</a>. <em>Hurriyet</em> has <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/10116148.asp?gid=243&sz=8870">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Tuesday&#39;s apology is apparently the first time the Turkish government has publicly apologized for police abuses or prison detainee deaths, although condition inside Turkish prisons have been internationally notorious for years. Last February, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/europe-rights-court-rules-against.php">violated the human rights of two men</a> [JURIST report] when police abused them to inhuman and degrading treatment and then failed to properly investigate their allegations of abuse. In July 2007, AI released a <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engeur440082007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/turkish-torture-continues-despite.php">report</a>] calling attention to the Turkish criminal justice system&#39;s continuing toleration and condoning of torture and ill-treatment by police and investigators.

The <a href="http://www.mindanews.com/pdf/news/moa-ad/MOA_COVER.pdf">Memorandum of Agreement on the Ancestral Domain</a> (MOA-AD) [text] between the MILF and the government of <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] would have given the minority Muslim faction expanded autonomy by creating the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE) in the Mindanao region of the Philippine islands. The Supreme Court ruled, however, that Arroyo had exceeded her powers in negotiating the agreement. According to the court&#39;s decision, <blockquote>[t]he MOA-AD cannot be reconciled with the present Constitution and laws. Not only its specific provisions but the very concept underlying them, namely, the associative relationship envisioned between the [Philippines government] and the BJE, are unconstitutional, for the concept presupposes that the associated entity is a state and implies that the same is on its way to independence. </blockquote>The government has said it <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/oct/16/yehey/top_stories/20081016top4.html">will not appeal</a> [<em>Manila Times</em> report] the decision. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Philippine Senate&#39;s National Defense and Security Committee called on Arroyo to <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20081015-166570/Palace-urged-to-resume-talks-with-MILF">resume peace talks</a> [<em>Daily Inquirer</em> report] with the MILF.

The high court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/183591-183752.pdf">enjoined the signing</a> of the proposed agreement in August after Christian politicians in Mindanao <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/philippines-high-court-hears-arguments.php">claimed it violated the constitution</a> [JURIST reports]. The government <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/philippine-government-may-allow.php">first suggested</a> [JURIST report] that it might agree to increased autonomy for the region in 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2008-03/16/content_783363.htm">Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao</a> [official profile] has signed a decree making permanent certain extensions on press freedom for foreign journalists that were temporarily adopted in the run-up to the July Beijing Olympics. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao announced late Friday, just before the <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/jzfw/t326215.htm">temporary regulations</a> [text, in English] were scheduled to expire, that henceforward foreign journalists would be able to travel inside the country except Tibet without requiring prior permission from the government and would be free to interview Chinese citizens. The temporary rules were adopted in January 2007. Human Rights Watch and other rights and media groups had <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/15/china19985.htm">lobbied vigorously for their extension</a> [HRW press release]. <a href="http://www.fccchina.org/">Foreign Correspondents Club of China</a> (FCCC) president Jonathan Watts welcomed the extension of the rules in a <a href="http://www.fccchina.org/what/statement171008.html">statement</a> [text], but urged the government &quot;to ensure that police and local officials respect the spirit as well as the letter of the new rules. The easing of controls for foreign journalists should not be achieved at the expense of putting more pressure on local sources.&quot; The FCCC additionally pressed for further steps, including &quot;the enactment of legislation protecting news sources, the abolition of rules obliging hotels to report to police when a foreign journalist checks in, and the opening of restricted areas...&quot;.

Herman, a <a href="http://works.bepress.com/susan_herman/doctype.html">constitutional and civil rights scholar</a> [selected works], previously served as the ACLU&#39;s general counsel. ACLU executive director <a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/13279res20030205.html">Anthony Romero</a> [ACLU profile] commented on her appointment:<blockquote>[She] is a deeply principled and talented leader who will ably harness the collective energies of the ACLU Board... She has a profound appreciation for the ACLU&#39;s historical role and monumental achievements and, at the same time, an enormous capacity to envision the ACLU&#39;s vibrant and growing role as it continues to fight the inevitable civil liberties challenges that lay ahead.</blockquote>Herman has said she wants to reach out to African Americans and communities of faith as she undertakes her new position. She succeeds former ACLU president <a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/13278res20020211.html">Nadine Strossen</a> [ACLU profile], who had held the position since 1991.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [official website; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14482/">backgrounder</a>] Central Committee Sunday issued a new policy paper liberalizing the country&#39;s land use laws in an effort to decrease rural poverty and increase the country&#39;s agricultural capacity. The CPC announced its <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-communist-party-approves-land-use.php">approval</a> [JURIST report] of the Decision on Major Issues Concerning the Advancement of Rural Reform and Development last week. The reforms give farmers - for the first time - broader autonomy to sell or borrow against their land use rights and establish a financial infrastructure to allow for larger and more efficient farms. Critics worry that the new system will leave some landlords and many landless farmers without land to work. In response, the CPC <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/19/content_10218172.htm">maintained</a> [Xinhua report] that the government would vigilantly protect the nation&#39;s farmland by adhering to a &quot;most stringent land conservation system&quot; to control the total area of land that is not used for farming. AP has <a href="http: com="" article="" aleqm5h99h9czjm51f9skair7hbeyqwndqd93u6rlo0=">more</a>; the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/19/asia/20china.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />These reforms come as the Chinese government continues to take steps towards a more democratic, capitalist structure while addressing international criticism for alleged human rights abuses. In September, the <a href="http://english.gov.cn/links/statecouncil.htm">State Council of China</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/china-regulations-clarify-labor.php">issued regulations</a> [JURIST report] implementing ambiguous provisions of the <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=56338">Labor Contract Law</a> [backgrounder] that was <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/01/business/chilabor.php">viewed as a major advancement</a> [Bloomberg report] in China&#39;s protection of workers&#39; rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Argentine president <a href="http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/senadores/biografia.php?id_sena=357&iOrden=0&iSen=ASC">Carlos Menem</a> [official website] failed to appear in a Buenos Aires court Thursday as he and other former officials went on trial on arms trafficking charges. The court excused Menem&#39;s absence after a defense lawyer presented a medical certificate indicating that the former president had been suffering from acute anemia. Menem, who led Argentina from 1989 to 1999, and his co-defendants are accused of arranging weapons sales to Croatia, in violation of a 1991 UN Security Council <a href="http://www.nato.int/ifor/un/u910925a.htm">resolution</a> [text] prohibiting the delivery of weapons to the former Yugoslavia, and to Ecuador, breaching a ban by the <a href="http://www.oas.org/">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) [official website] on sales to that nation and Peru during their <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981025/29850154.html">1995 border conflict</a> [AFP report]. The judges presiding over the case plan to <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1060132">send a representative</a> [<em>La Nacion</em> report, in Spanish] to Menem&#39;s home in La Rioja province to verify his health claims and are reportedly considering whether to travel there with the prosecutor to fulfill a requirement that the indictment be read in Menem&#39;s presence. The trial is expected to last seven months. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hAtyxgZA48XecWf-0MO4IoLcVL6AD93RSU3O0">more</a>.<br /><br />In May, an Argentine prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/argentina-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-of-ex.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] seeking the arrests of Menem and five others accused of obstructing an investigation into the 1994 <a href="http://www.amia.org.ar/content/article_detail.aspx?aid=79&sid=94">bombing of a Jewish community center</a> [AMIA backgrounder, in Spanish] in Buenos Aires. In 2004, an Argentine judge <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/argentine-judge-will-ask-swiss-to.htm">conducted an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the possible connection between Swiss bank accounts allegedly held by Menem and the bombing, which killed 85 people. Menem was <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/06/07/menem.arrest.02/index.html">placed under house arrest</a> [CNN report] on arms-trafficking charges in 2001 but was freed later that year. In 2004, he moved to Chile, where a court <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3789059.stm">refused to extradite him</a> [BBC report] for questioning on corruption charges. He <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4118375.stm">returned to Argentina</a> [JURIST report] later that year after arrest warrants were withdrawn. He was elected to the Argentine Senate in 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The former vice mayor of Beijing, Liu Zhihua, has been given a suspended death sentence for bribery and corruption, according to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/19/content_10217280.htm">state media reports</a> [Xinhua report] Sunday. Liu had been in charge of construction projects for China&#39;s capital city in preparation for the 2008 Olympic games. He had been elected to the position in 1999 and served until June 2006, when it was alleged that he received 6.97 million yuan ($1.02 million) in exchange for providing contracts, loans, and other favorable promotions for others. Six months after his removal, Liu was dismissed from the <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/index.html">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [official website; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14482/">backgrounder</a>]. The death sentence was delayed for two years, which likely means that if Liu exhibits good behavior he will given life imprisonment. Liu&#39;s lawyer said he will likely appeal the verdict.

Hamdan was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-sentence-could-mean-fewer-than.php">sentenced</a> to five and a half years in prison in August, following his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] of providing <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2007/Hamdan_Charges.pdf">material support for terrorism</a> [charge sheet, PDF], but was credited for the five years he has been detained since charges were first brought against him. In the filing, prosecutors argued that Hamdan&#39;s detention in Guantanamo Bay was as an enemy combatant, and therefore was unconnected to the charges for which he was convicted. Hamdan&#39;s defense has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/hamdan-opp-re-new-sentence.pdf">argued</a> [filing, PDF] in opposition that the commission had appropriately exercised its discretion by granting the credit, and that the government&#39;s motion violated procedural rules of the commission. The government has now filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/us-reply-re-hamdan-sentence-10-16-08.pdf">reply</a> [PDF text] to the defense&#39;s filing. SCOTUSblog has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/us-wants-hamdan-held-longer/#more-8101">more</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001, when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until July. A judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia later <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-delay-hamdan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by Hamdan&#39;s lawyers to stay his trial, ruling that a civilian court should refrain from reviewing the case until the military commission issues a final judgment. In July, the military court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bulgarian court on Monday began criminal proceedings against nine people accused of embezzling millions of dollars from <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website, English] aid funds. The defendants are accused of stealing 14 million leva ($9.6 million) from funds made available to Bulgaria by the EU as part of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/external/enlarge/back/index_en.htm">Special Accession Program for Agricultural and Rural Development</a> (SAPARD) [official website]. The suspected criminal network, made up of more than 50 Bulgarian, European, and offshore companies, is allegedly controlled by Mario Nikolov and Lyudmil Stoykov. Charges were filed against Nikolov and his wife, but no charges have been filed against Stoykov. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Sofia Echo</font> has <a href="http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/first-hearing-of-a-highly-debated-eu-funds-embezzlement-case/id_32458/catid_66">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />A probe was launched more than two years ago on a tip from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/index_en.html">European Anti-Fraud Office</a> (OLAF) [official website]. The reported widespread abuse spurred the EU into <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bulgarian-government-freezes-eu-funds.php">freezing projects</a> [JURIST report] worth millions of dollars in July. This is reportedly the first case of its kind in Bulgaria, which only joined the EU in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The High Criminal Court in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday <a href="http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=117909">began the trial</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Turkish Daily News</span> report] of 86 defendants accused of attempting to destabilize and overthrow the country&#39;s ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website]. The accused are said to belong to the secular <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder] group, believed responsible for bombing the headquarters of the newspaper <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?em=cumhuriyet/w/c01.html"><em>Cumhuriyet</em></a> [newspaper website, in Turkish], assassinating Turkish-Armenian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>], and planning other attacks to provoke a military coup to topple the AKP. Among those on trial are journalists, intellectuals, and <a href="http://www.ip.org.tr/">Turkish Workers&#39; Party</a> [party website, in Turkish] leader <a href="http://www.doguperincek.gen.tr/">Dogu Perincek</a> [personal website, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/turkish-politician-charged-over-alleged.php">report</a>]. Shortly after the trial began on Monday, protests disrupted the proceedings, causing them to be temporarily suspended. The trial is scheduled to resume on Thursday when the presiding judge will consider a defense motion that he be removed for bias. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7679158.stm">more</a>. Anatolian Agency has <a href="http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=30073">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />When the defendants in the case were <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">indicted</a> in July, the court&#39;s chief prosecutor said that he planned to make additional indictments, but that the trials for <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">those suspects</a> [JURIST reports] would be held separately. Critics allege that the AKP has improperly investigated secular groups as part of a drive to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1001934.html">impose Islamic principles</a> [<em>Ha&#39;aretz</em> report] in violation of the country&#39;s secular <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/tu00000_.html">constitution</a> [text], and that the <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/home/9432518.asp?gid=244&sz=17470">link between the group and the alleged plots is weak</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">H&uuml;rriyet</span> op-ed]. In March, Turkish Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/turkish-pm-assails-prosecutor-bid-to.php">petitioned the country&#39;s Constitutional Court to disband the AKP</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly working to undermine the nation&#39;s secular principles. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkish-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected his bid</a> [JURIST report] in August.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish prosecutors Monday challenged a probe launched by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Judge Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] into the disappearances of tens of thousands of people from the beginning of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882902">Spanish Civil War</a> [BBC backgrounder] through the early years of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco&#39;s dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder], asserting that any wartime disappearances and executions are covered by Spain&#39;s 1977 amnesty law, passed to aid Spain in moving past Franco. Garzon, who <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">launched his investigation last week</a> [JURIST report], has argued that the mass disappearances constituted crimes against humanity and there is no applicable statute of limitations. Members of Spain&#39;s conservative minority <a href="http://www.pp.es/index.asp">Popular Party</a> [official website, in Spanish] have also voiced their objection to the investigation, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081018/wl_afp/spainhistoryjusticemissing_081018194611">arguing </a>[AFP report] that it would reopen old wounds.

Garzon, widely known for his high-profile investigations of terror and human rights cases, previously called for the <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/spanish-judge-calls-for-franco-truth.php">creation of a &quot;truth commission&quot;</a> [JURIST report] to uncover Franco-era abuses. In September he began <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">assembling a definitive registry</a> [JURIST report] of the tens of thousands of victims of the Spanish Civil War and the Franco regime.

The Court will consider whether the government must show that the defendant had actual knowledge that the means of identification he used belonged to another person in order to prove aggravated identity theft under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001028---A000-.html">18 U.S.C. &sect; 1028A(a)(1)</a> [text]. The <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] has used this law to bring aggravated identity theft cases against illegal immigrants, many of whom do not know that their fake identifications belong to someone else.<br /><br />Also Monday, the Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari</em> in the capital case of <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-5385.htm">Walker v.

The petitioner alleged that the Georgia Supreme Court failed to conduct meaningful proportionality review, and to enforce reporting requirements. Justice John Paul Stevens issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-5385Stevens.pdf">statement</a> [PDF] in which he emphasized that the Court&#8217;s denial has no precedential effect and said that the petitioner&#8217;s submission was supported by the Court&#39;s prior opinions evaluating the constitutionality of the Georgia statute. Justice Clarence Thomas <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-5385Thomas.pdf">concurred</a> [PDF] in the denial of certiorari.

In his opening arguments, Deputy US Attorney William Fitzpatrick argued that the accused were inspired by al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. Defense lawyers are expected to question the role of two paid government informants who made hundreds of hours of secret recordings in the case. The defense contends there was no plot but the government paid informants to get the accused to discuss one. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hpU78Fwu6-swpC3MuWomEA9WYcCQD93U73GO0">more</a>.<br /><br />The five suspects, Serdar Tatar, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, and Shain Duka, were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/six-arrested-for-plotting-attack-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 for allegedly plotting to sneak onto the New Jersey military base and kill soldiers. They <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/fort-dix-plot-suspects-plead-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Their trial is expected to last into December.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran has banned the execution of minors for drug-related crimes, but will still allow the sentence to be imposed against juveniles convicted of murder, according to a <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hEpCQELUurPSUIMGb53VspZr39FQD93SUD800">statement</a> [AP report] made by Iran&#39;s Assistant Attorney General for Judicial Affairs Hossein Zabhi on Saturday. Zabhi announced a <a href="http://www.etemaad.com/Released/87-07-27/150.htm#118218">new directive</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Etemaad</span> report, in Arabic] limiting the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by minors last week, but the scope of the ban had been unclear. Zabhi has now said that executions for juvenile offenders will still be allowed where the punishment is sought by the victim&#39;s family under an Islamic law principle of retribution called <em>qisas</em>. The directive had been praised by rights groups including <a href="http://scenews.blog.com/4023595/">Stop Child Executions</a> (SCE), <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/iran-to-end-child-executions-20081017">Amnesty International</a> (AI), and <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/17/iran19997.htm">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [press releases], but is likely to be criticized in light of the clarification. The sentences of those juvenile offenders set to to be executed for drug crimes will be commuted to life in prison under the directive. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49H0RF.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In September, the Office of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a> [JURIST news archive] to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27894&Cr=iran&Cr1=">ban the use of the death penalty</a> [UN News Centre report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/un-rights-commission-urges-iran-to-stop.php">report</a>] against juvenile offenders. Later that month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hrw-calls-for-global-end-to-juvenile.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] calling on all Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, and Yemen to stop their use of the punishment for minors. In August, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-executes-man-for-crime-he.php">executed a man</a> [JURIST report] for a stabbing he was convicted of committing as a minor. Rights groups say Iranian executions of juveniles violate the terms of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/child.html">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], to which Iran is a signatory, but officials for the country argue that it and similar executions are allowed because the offenders reached the age of majority before being executed. HRW has <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">said</a> [press release] that Iran leads the world in executing the most people for crimes committed as children and SCE keeps a <a href="http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx">list</a> [advocacy materials] of minors facing execution in Iran.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Moscow arbitration court Friday overturned most of Russian government&#39;s tax claims against the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/new/">British Council</a> [official website], the British government&#39;s cultural relations arm, over the organization&#8217;s in-country operations in 2004-2006. The claims were made in late 2006 in the midst of strained relations between Russia and the United Kingdom over the demanded extradition of former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lugovoi+OR+lugovoy">Andrei Lugovoy</a> [JURIST news archive], suspected by UK intelligence services of poisoning former KGB agent and British citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179074.stm">timeline</a>]. Following the filing of the tax claims, the Russian government issued a directive to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7139959.stm">shut down</a> [BBC report] the 14 <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/russia.htm">Russian regional offices</a> [official website] of the British Council in December 2007. The British Council unilaterally <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/british-council-office-re-openings.php">resumed</a> its Russian operations in January 2008 in defiance of what it considered to be the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/russia-uk-trade-legal-barbs-over.php">&quot;illegal&quot;</a> [JURIST reports] shutdown order and filed a lawsuit to dispute the taxation claims. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7675779.stm">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081017/117795732.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Russia has clamped down on foreign associations operating within its territory since a controversial law imposing restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/russia-ngo-law-takes-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in April 2006. The law imposes strict financial oversight on NGOs and provides for dissolution if an organization&#39;s activities is deemed to &quot;threaten Russia&#39;s independence or sovereignty&quot; or if an organization participates in activities deemed to deviate from its mission statement. Then-Russian President Vladimir Putin defended the measure as being <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/putin-says-new-ngo-law-aimed-against.php">necessary to protect against &quot;puppeteers abroad&quot;</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">news archive</a>] on Friday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ohio-order-10-17-08.pdf">vacated</a> [order, PDF] a temporary restraining order (TRO) requiring Ohio&#39;s secretary of state to establish a system that allows county elections boards to confirm newly registered voters&#39; eligibility. The Court granted a request by <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner</a> [official website] to stay the TRO, which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sixth-circuit-orders-ohio-to-take.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday by the US <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/newopn.pl">Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website]. In the TRO, the district court ordered Brunner to comply with an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/15483.html#a">anti-fraud provision</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) [FEC materials] that requires state election and motor vehicles officials to match information between their databases to ensure voter eligibility. According to the Supreme Court&#39;s brief <em>per curiam</em> opinion, <blockquote>[t]he Secretary argues both that the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter the TRO and that its ruling on the merits was erroneous. We express no opinion on the question whether HAVA is being properly implemented. Respondents, however, are not sufficiently likely to prevail on the question whether Congress has authorized the District Court to enforce Section 303 in an action brought by a private litigant to justify the issuance of a TRO. </blockquote>Reacting to the Court&#39;s decision, Robert Bennett, chairman of the <a href="http://www.ohiogop.org/">Ohio Republican Party</a> [party website], <a href="http://www.ohiogop.org/press/articles/2008/10/statement-chairman-bennett-u-s-supreme-court-ruling">said</a> [news release] the decision &quot;was made on a technicality, not on the merits of the case&quot; as he accused Brunner of &quot;actively working to conceal fraudulent activity in this election.&quot; Brunner, in her own <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/PressReleases/2008%20Press%20Releases/20081017.aspx">statement</a> [text], said the Court &quot;has protected the voting rights of all Ohioans, allowing our bipartisan elections officials to continue preparing for a successful November election.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h5P2f-dgLBCzuRdaaWR2BTYBb81AD93SCOI00">more</a>. The <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> has <a href="http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/10/17/brunner_scotus.html?sid=101">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The TRO gave Brunner until Friday to furnish county elections officials with lists of prospective voters whose information in state databases contains discrepancies, or to provide the officials with access to the statewide voter registration database so they could resolve the discrepancies. In its <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0374p-06.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF text], Sixth Circuit said that Brunner had offered insufficient evidentiary support for her arguments that altering computer programs to comply with the order would threaten the election process. Last week, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states, including Ohio, had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/voters-illegally-removed-from-rolls-in.php">removed from voter rolls</a> [JURIST] against federal voting law. The <em>Times</em> article found that elections officials had violated HAVA by cross-checking voter rolls with lists from the Social Security Administration before using information from other sources, as required by the statute. Voters and advocacy groups have challenged Ohio elections procedures since the state&#39;s pivotal role in the 2004 presidential campaign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/">Russian Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Russian] has released a <a href="http://www.mid.ru/Brp_4.nsf/arh/513FFDF1FB9D6AA2C32574E300559F11?OpenDocument">statement</a> [text, in Russian] downplaying the recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/icj-orders-georgia-russia-to-stop.php">order of provisional measures</a> [JURIST report] against both Russia and Georgia by the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] in respect of the breakaway Georgian regions of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">South Ossetia and Abkhazia</a> [JURIST news archive] and challenging the court&#39;s jurisdiction to proceed to the merits of the case. The ICJ issued the provisional measures last Wednesday, <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14801.pdf?PHPSESSID=7907e506034b85352c378e5ed7f52ab5">rejecting</a> [decision text, PDF] an emergency request by the Georgian Republic to order an outright halt to the alleged killing and mass displacement of citizens in the conflict region, and instead calling on both Georgia and Russia to meet their obligations under the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [text]. The Russian statement emphasized the provisional nature of the ICJ order, and the close vote taken to approve the action:<blockquote> ...The court addressed measures to both sides. They are general in nature and pointed to the need for the parties to comply with the obligations under the [CERD]. However, even such a decision was taken by only one vote. 7 out of 15 [sic] judges agreed with the Russian position on the apparent lack of jurisdiction of the [ICJ] in this case. ...<br /><br />Given that the [ICJ&#39;s] decision on jurisdiction in the context of interim measures is preliminary in nature, we intend to continue to prove that the [ICJ] has no jurisdiction in this case, at the next stage of the proceedings.</blockquote>Interfax has <a href="http://www.interfax.com/3/437185/news.aspx">more</a>.<br /><br />Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">brought the case</a> [JURIST report] in August after Russia sent its military into Georgia in response to a Georgian bid to strike the breakaway South Ossetia region, heavily populated with Russians. Last month Georgia <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14727.pdf">sought</a> [ICJ press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-presents-argument-against.php">report</a>] emergency orders from the ICJ, arguing that Russia is engaged in ethnic cleansing and has violated the CERD by removing ethnic Georgians from the territories. Russia countered that its military actions have saved lives, and that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction over the case. In August, Russia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">instituted its own action</a> [JURIST report] against Georgia in the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cpi.int%2Fhome.html%26l%3Den&ei=kmPISOjjEYXGeoCazLgB&usg=AFQjCNGJUlA-BRBuc2s6fmrrdvGtRbGqdQ&sig2=tFj3pq19L_qpG_9Z8NSGpQ">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], alleging that Georgia committed war crimes against ethnic Russians in South Ossetia. Tensions remain high following Russia&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/russia-signs-defense-agreements-with.php">signing of military defense agreements</a> [JURIST report] with South Ossetia and Abkhazia last month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int////tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?action=open&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&key=73492&sessionId=14828698&skin=hudoc-en&attachment=true">ruled</a> [judgment, DOC text; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=5608/05&sessionid=14828346&skin=hudoc-pr-fr">press release</a>] that <a href="/countries/france.php">France</a> [JURIST news archive] had violated the human rights of a psychotic inmate by failing to prevent his suicide. The court unanimously found that French authorities had breached Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF text] by failing to protect Joselito Renolde&#39;s right to life and had violated Article 3 of the convention by treating him in an inhumane and degrading manner. According to the judgment, <blockquote>the Court is struck by the fact that, despite Joselito Renolde&#8217;s suicide attempt and the diagnosis of his mental condition, it does not appear that there was ever any discussion of whether he should be admitted to a psychiatric institution. The experts noted in their report that &#8220;[his] disorders could perhaps have called for a discussion of the advisability of admission to a psychiatric unit&#8221;. However, not until Joselito Renolde&#8217;s lawyer requested steps to be taken on 12 July 2000 was an expert assessment envisaged as to whether his condition was compatible with detention.<br /><br />In the light of the State&#8217;s positive obligation to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual whose life is at risk, it might have been expected that the authorities, faced with a prisoner known to be suffering from serious mental disturbance and to pose a suicide risk, would take special measures geared to his condition to ensure its compatibility with continued detention. </blockquote>The court further found that the authorities had imposed inappropriate punishment by failing to account for Renolde&#39;s mental condition when they sent him solitary confinement for attacking a guard. Renolde&#39;s survivors did not submit a claim for damages under the convention. AFP has <a href="http://www.adetocqueville.com/200810161122.m9gbmvx18245.htm">more</a>. <em>Le Monde</em> has <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2008/10/16/cour-europeenne-la-france-condamnee-pour-un-suicide-en-prison_1107827_0.html">local coverage</a>, in French.<br /><br />Last week, after a 16-year-old inmate <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h8EPrxiJk_Li6Go2oAYoZXooxNdg">killed himself</a> [AFP report, in French] at a jail in northeastern France, the the <a href="http://www.oip.org/">International Observatory of Prisons</a> (OIP) [advocacy website] called on the French government to release statistics about the number of suicides in prisons during 2008 and reports by committees that monitor prison suicides. The group said in a <a href="http://www.oip.org/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=448&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=156">statement</a> [text, in French] that the number of French prisoners committing suicide had increased 27 percent in the first half of 2008 compared with the same period last year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Thursday condemned what it called obstruction and interference by the government of <a href="http://web.presidencia.gov.co/presidente/">Colombian President Alvaro Uribe</a> [official profile, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3214685.stm">profile</a>] in the investigation and prosecution of far-right militias in the country. A new <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/colombia1008/colombia1008webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/16/colomb19988.htm">press release</a>] released by the rights group entitled &quot;Breaking the Grip: Obstacles to Justice for Paramilitary Mafias in Colombia,&quot; criticized Uribe&#39;s actions with respect to the investigation into right-wing military groups and their <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/21/AR2007052101672_pf.html">relationships with political leaders and institutions</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. The report applauded efforts against the militias by judges and prosecutors, but said:<blockquote>Unfortunately, the administration of President &Aacute;lvaro Uribe is squandering much of the opportunity to truly dismantle paramilitaries&#8217; mafias. While there has been progress in some areas, some of the administration&#8217;s actions are undermining the investigations that have the best chance of making a difference.<br /><br />Of greatest concern, the Uribe administration has:<br /><br />- Repeatedly launched public personal attacks on the Supreme Court and its members in what increasingly looks like a concerted campaign to smear and discredit the Court.<br /><br />- Opposed and effectively blocked meaningful efforts to reform the Congress to eliminate paramilitary influence.<br /><br />- Proposed constitutional reforms that would remove the &#8220;parapolitics&#8221; investigations from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.<br /><br />If the Uribe administration continues on this path, it is likely that the enormous efforts made by Colombia&#8217;s courts and prosecutors to hold paramilitaries&#8217; accomplices accountable will ultimately fail to break their power. Unless it changes course, Colombia may remain a democracy in a formal sense, but violence, threats, and corruption will continue to be common tools for obtaining and exercizing power in the country.</blockquote> The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/story/729632.html">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603613.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Uribe has frequently clashed with the Colombian courts, particularly in matters concerning the country&#39;s long feud with right-wing anti-government paramilitaries. Last April, a Colombian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/colombia-court-halts-extradition-of.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the extradition of one militia leader to the US, although he was later <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/May/08_crm_388.html">extradited</a> [DOJ press release] in early May. In May 2007, the Colombian high court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/colombia-high-court-orders-lawmakers.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of five congressmen for alleged ties to the <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/auc.cfm">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CDI backgrounder], which is designated as a terrorist group by the US. All of the political representatives were supporters of Uribe. Uribe has said that any official ties to paramilitary forces will not be tolerated, indicating that members of government will be removed from their positions if it seems they have paramilitary affiliations. In March 2007, a Colombian judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/colombia-ex-intelligence-chief-released.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of ex-intelligence chief <a href="http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/blog/archives/000242.htm">Jorge Noguera</a> [CIP backgrounder] because no formal charges had been made against him. Noguera, who was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/colombia-ex-intelligence-chief-arrested.php">arrested</a> earlier that month, is accused of murder and conspiracy for <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-ruling-may-disrupt.php">allegedly contracting with illegal paramilitary groups</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, the <a href="http://www.ramajudicial.gov.co/csj_portal/jsp/contenido/plantillaFrame.jsp?idsitio=2">Constitutional Court</a> [official backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-ruling-may-disrupt.php">threw out</a> a part of the controversial 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/colombia-passes-bill-intended-to.php">Justice and Peace Law</a> [JURIST reports] approved by Uribe, which gave lesser punishments to paramilitary leaders who voluntarily disarm.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Commission</a> [official website] has launched a series of legal actions in the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=european+court+of+justice">news archive</a>] against EU member states for failures to abide by EU laws, according to <a href="http://europa.eu/press_room/press_releases/index_en.htm">press statements</a> [text] released by the Commission on Thursday. Filings ranged from infringement proceedings against Poland and Sweden for failing to fully implement rules providing common conditions for the reuse of information produced, collected and shared by public bodies in the EU to actions against Portugal and France over the non-reimbursement of the costs for medical treatment in other EU countries. Ten member-states &#8211; Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom &#8211; were subjected to infringement proceedings for their failure to implement certain Internal Market Directives into national law. Legal action was taken against Italy for several matters, including the failure to implement regulations on compulsory maximum legal fees, the adoption of tax legislation which discriminates against regenerated oil coming from other EU states, and its questionable compliance with a court order concerning the purchase of helicopters.<br /><br />The European Commission is responsible for ensuring EU law is applied throughout all Member States. The Commission&#39;s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/index_en.htm">Secretariat-General</a> [official website] is tasked with monitoring support given by national authorities to commercial organizations, keeping track of the measures taken by the authorities in the Member States to incorporate EU law into their national law, and taking action when they fail to do so properly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-05-160-ENG.pdf">requested</a> [court order, PDF] more information on an arrest warrant application for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>], who faces charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities committed in the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. The pretrial chamber requested that <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] submit &#8220;additional supporting materials in relation to some confidential aspects&#8221; of his application no later than November 17, 2008. The ICC&#8217;s request coincided with the start of a three-day peace conference in Khartoum, which included delegates from dozens of political parties and civic groups in Sudan. Rebel groups from the western Sudanese region, however, were not in attendance, dismissing the meeting as an attempt by al-Bashir to whitewash his reputation and avoid international prosecution. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jDthBefcn9QwCOu4bUdbUHkIuEpQ">more</a>.<br /><br />Moreno-Ocampo applied for the <a href="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.51.1/t.gif">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] last July for crimes al-Bashir allegedly committed in the Darfur region of Sudan. The application, which followed a three-year investigation involving more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, began in 2005 with the <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-us-allows-icc.php">referral of the situation to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor</a> [JURIST report]. This past June, Moreno-Ocampo stated before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221; The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, labeling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Defense Department</a> (DOD) [official website] has released a revised <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/d3115_09.pdf">directive</a> [PDF text] mandating military supervision of intelligence interrogations and questioning conducted by other US government agencies, foreign governments and contractors. The directive, issued October 9 by <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=47">Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England</a> [official profile] but only made public this week, supersedes a <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/OathBetrayed/Interrogation%20Directive%203115.09.pdf">2005 version</a> [PDF text] that merely required non-DOD entities conducting such procedures to conform to Pentagon policies. According to the new directive, <blockquote>[a]ll individuals representing other U.S. Government agencies, foreign governments, or any other non-DoD entity must comply with applicable DoD interrogation policies and procedures when conducting intelligence interrogations, debriefings, or other questioning of persons detained by the Department of Defense. These individuals shall sign a written agreement to abide by DoD interrogation policies and procedures before being allowed access to any detainee in the custody or effective control of the Department of Defense. </blockquote>The directive permits the audiovisual recording of interrogation sessions on a case-by-case basis. Unlike the prior version, the new directive explicitly prohibits <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/07/11/050711fa_fact4">survival, evasion, resistance and escape (SERE) techniques</a> [<em>New Yorker</em> report] such as <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=waterboard ">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], which simulates drowning. The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-interrogate15-2008oct15,0,1495957.story">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&ct=us/0-0&fp=48f809749192c2c3&ei=Oor4SPLxGpnU9QTfgoCdCQ&url=http%3A//afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ih5XLCj5feZEwSaxMj2s1KHj5Tgw&cid=1258214192&usg=AFQjCNGG8j04NE3tDbNezbpkvdxteAP1Tw">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Several former detainees at Iraq&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive] have sued US military contractors alleging that they were tortured in violation of US and international law. This month, lawyers for one contractor, CACI International, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-military-contractor-claims-immunity.php">moved to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on grounds of immunity. CACI&#39;s lawyers argued that the company is protected by derivative absolute immunity because its work was ordered by the government. That lawsuit, filed in July, followed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/abu-ghraib-ex-detainee-files-torture.php">similar action</a> [JURIST report] brought by another ex-detainee in May. Last year, a US district judge <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv1165-137">refused to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit against CACI alleging that the contractor was responsible for the torture of more than 250 former detainees held in Iraqi prisons. The <em>Washington Post</em> reported this week that two classified memos sent from the White House to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/enhanced-interrogation-techniques-can.php">sanctioned the use of certain harsh interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST report]. US Justice Department (DOJ) memos <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/enhanced-interrogation-techniques-can.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in July suggested that certain &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques are lawful and that those who employ them in good faith lack the specific intent required to be charged with torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> and the Nigerian <a href="http://www.ledapnigeria.org/">Legal Defense and Assistance Project</a> (LEDAP) [advocacy websites] condemned Nigeria&#39;s capital punishment practices in a joint <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR44/020/2008/en/f5297853-96dc-11dd-baed-87eba7d59a3c/afr440202008en.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/poverty-and-the-death-penalty-in-nigeria-20081021">press release</a>] released Tuesday, claiming that death row inmates are being denied their rights to proper representation and appeal and calling for a moratorium on executions. According to the report, <blockquote>capital punishment can only be used after the most exacting due process of law. However, as this report shows, the failures in the Nigerian criminal justice system breach international human rights law and standards. Suspects in capital offences and death row prisoners are denied their right to a fair trial and appeal process. The violation of an individual&#39;s legal rights often starts at the point of arrest. Police routinely use torture to extract confessions as a substitute for thorough and impartial investigation of the crime. As a result the majority of death row prisoners were sentenced to death based on confessions. </blockquote>Of 736 prisoners currently awaiting execution in the country, the groups say that 35 have spent more than 15 years on death row and 47 percent are waiting for their appeals to be concluded. Twenty-five percent of appeals have lasted longer than five years, with some lasting as long as 20. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/country/NG/news/usnLL41064.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Instances of police torture and other <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/nigeria-prisons-systematically-violate.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in Nigeria have been previously <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21822&Cr=torture&Cr1">flagged</a> [UN News Centre report] by the United Nations as well as Amnesty. Section 33(1) of the <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Nigerian Constitution</a> [text] specifically permits abrogation of an individual&#39;s right to life &quot;in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence of which he has been found guilty in Nigeria.&quot; Amnesty is uniformly opposed to the death penalty in all cases and in all countries. Last week, Amnesty released a report linking the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/saudi-execution-rate-connected-to.php">large number of executions in Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST report] to flaws in the Saudi justice system, including the closed nature of the judicial process, the imposition of the death penalty for relatively minor offenses and a lack of legal assistance for the accused.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Thailand on Monday <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=131548">convicted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report] ousted prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] of <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/thailand-formally-files-corruption.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] related to a 2003 purchase of land by his wife <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive] from the government-controlled <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website]. Thaksin was sentenced to two years in prison for abuse of power for using his position to secure a reduced price for the land, and violating a Thai law prohibiting political leaders from engaging in business dealings with government-directed organizations. Pojamarn, <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">also charged in the case</a> [JURIST report], was cleared of charges because she was not a government official. The two were <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-court-to-try-ex-pm-thaksin-and.php">tried <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] after failing to return from an August <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-high-court-issues-arrest.php">trip to the UK</a> [JURIST report] because of what they said was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-officials-deny-thaksin.php">judicial bias</a> [JURIST report] by Thai courts. Thailand&#39;s Office of the Attorney General on Monday said it would <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=131550">seek Thaksin&#39;s extradition</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] in light of the conviction. Thaksin took refuge in the UK after being <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">overthrown by the Thai military</a>&nbsp;while travelling abroad in 2006, but he later <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/thailand-ex-pm-returns-to-face.php">returned</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] to the country to dispute the charges. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h1AK6Ye51CdW_6vqrCbILNAmDFRQD93UQ7K80">more</a>.<br /><br />Thaksin&#39;s conviction is the latest in a long series of corruption actions brought against Thaksin and Pojamarn. In August, Thai prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-prosecutors-ask-court-to-seize.php">seize over $2 billion</a> [JURIST report] from the Shinawatras&#39; frozen accounts and holdings in relation to the charges. In July, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution reducing fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. Later that month, Pojmarn, as well as her step brother and secretary, were <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-court-convicts-wife-of-ex-pm.php">convicted of tax evasion</a> [JURIST report] for transferring $16.3 million worth of stock she transferred to the two. Also that month, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-high-court-takes-corruption.php">agreed to hear</a> additional charges against Thaksin and 47 other for <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">alleged misconduct</a> [JURIST reports] related to the country&#39;s lottery system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/433.html">ruled</a> [press release] on two separate appeals filed by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/organs/otp.html">Office of the Chief Prosecutor</a> [official website], reversing for now the Trial Chamber&#39;s decision to release former Congolese militia leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6131516.stm">Thomas Lubanga</a> [BBC profiler; JURIST news <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=lubanga">archive</a>] but <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1486-ENG.pdf">dismissing a request</a> [judgment, PDF] that it lift an indefinite stay on his trial. The Appeals Chamber <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1487-ENG.pdf">remanded to the Trial Chamber</a> [judgment, PDF] the ultimate question of whether Lubanga should be conditionally or unconditionally released, or whether he should remain in custody. The ICC Trial Chamber in June had <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1401-ENG.pdf">imposed an indefinite stay</a> [PDF text] on Lubanga&#39;s war crimes trial after accusing the prosecution of using confidentiality agreements to withhold possible exonerating evidence, and in July <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-orders-release-of-congo-ex-militia.php">ordered his release</a> [JURIST report]. According to the Appeals Chamber:<br /><blockquote>[T]he Trial Chamber was faced with a situation in which a large number of documents containing potentially exculpatory information or information relevant to the preparation of the defence was in the possession of the Prosecutor, but could not be disclosed to Mr. Lubanga Dyilo. Nor could the Trial Chamber have access to the documents in order to assess whether a fair trial could be held even without the disclosure of the documents . . . If the trial of Mr. Lubanga Dyilo had taken place in such circumstances, there would always have been a lurking doubt as to whether the disclosure of the documents in question would have changed the course of the trial.</blockquote>The Appeals Chamber concluded it should remand the release case so the court could &quot;consider all relevant circumstances,&quot; rather than concluding that unconditional release of an accused is the &quot;inevitable consequence&quot; when conditional stay of proceedings is granted. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Telegraph</font> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/lawreports/joshuarozenberg/3235039/Lubanga-prosecutor-loses-again.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Lubanga, once the leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/upc.htm">Union of Patriotic Congolese</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">charged with using child soldiers</a> [JURIST report] in his militia, which allegedly committed large-scale human rights abuses in Congo&#39;s violent <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2003/ituri0703/">Ituri district</a> [HRW backgrounder] in 2002. He became the <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/congo-militia-leader-makes-first.php">first war crimes defendant to appear</a> before the ICC after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/biography_0116.shtm">Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile] Wednesday issued a final rule setting out the details of his department&#39;s <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/layers/secureflight/index.shtm">air passenger screening program</a> [TSA official site]. Under the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/assets/pdf/secureflight_final_rule.pdf">Secure Flight Final Rule</a> [PDF text], responsibility for vetting the nation&#39;s air passengers moves from individual airlines to the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA)[offical site]. Airlines will collect the names, birthdays and genders of their passengers and transmit this information to the TSA, which will compare that against the government&#39;s &quot;no fly&quot; terrorist watch list and instruct airlines whether or not to issue a boarding pass. The collection of additional information is intended to reduce the number of misidentifications and increase the efficacy of the watch list, which has been <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/terror-watch-list-inefficient-homeland.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office</a> [official site] for being inefficient. Screening for domestic flights is set to begin in early 2009, with matching on international flights slated for later in the year. The <em>Washington Post</I> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102200242.html">more</a><br /><br />In response to <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2005/06/why-isnt-secure-flight-grounded">privacy concerns</a> [EFF report; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/31557prs20070905.html">report</a>], TSA Administrator Kip Hawley said <blockquote>Secure Flight will improve security by maintaining the confidentiality of the government&#39;s watch list information while fully protecting passengers&#39; privacy and civil liberties. ... Ensuring privacy has been a cornerstone of this program and TSA has developed a comprehensive privacy plan to incorporate privacy laws and practices into all areas of Secure Flight.</blockquote>Privacy issues have plagued previous attempts at implementation of the program. In 2005, the TSA <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/congressional-investigators-say-tsa.php">collected personal data</a> [JURIST report] on commercial airline passengers to test the system, in violation of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm">Privacy Act of 1974</a> [text] and a congressional ban. The data collection and review methods and risk ranking scheme in Secure Flight&#39;s abortive predecessor, the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0347.shtm">Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System</a> (CAPPS II)[DHS fact sheet; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/01/us-to-adopt-new-airport-screening.htm">report</a>] were criticized by Congress, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> [advocacy website] and inside the TSA itself for being too intrusive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Judge Benjamin Settle <a href="/pdf/watadaorder.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] Tuesday that Iraq war objector <a href="http://www.thankyoult.org/index.php">1st Lt. Ehren Watada</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Watada">news archive</a>] cannot face a second court-martial on all charges for which he already faced court-martial. Settle&#39;s order held that a second-court martial of Watada on three of the five charges in his first court-martial would constitute <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/anncon/amdt5afrag2_user.html#amdt5a_hd7">double jeopardy</a> [LII backgrounder] in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution. Settle had<a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-grants-injunction-against.php"> granted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the second court-martial in November 2007 in order to resolve the double jeopardy dispute. The controversy over Watada&#39;s second court-martial concerns the declaration of a mistrial in the case by Lt. Col. John Head, the military judge overseeing the court martial, after he rejected a Stipulation of Fact by Watada and the government, conceding that Watada was guilty of the charge of Missing Movement when he missed a flight that would have flown him to his post in Iraq. Head rejected the Stipulation to Fact on the grounds that it was not a confessional stipulation because Watada believed that he had a justifiable reason for missing the flight, and that reason constituted a defense to the Missing Movement charge. In ruling that Watada cannot be face court-martialed for a second time on certain of the charges, Judge Settle wrote <blockquote>The strictest scrutiny should be applied to the trial judge&#39;s determination [to order a mistrial] because the record reflects that the Government moved for a mistrial on the basis that it was unable to proceed with its case. In the alternative, the judge did not exercise sound discretion when he failed to engage in a procedurally adequate development of his determination that a mistrial was appropriate. Under either level of review, the record does not reflect that there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial over Petitioner&#39;s objection. As a result, the Government is barred from retrying Petitioner on Charge I [Missing Movement] and Charge II, Specifications 1 and 4 [Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman], because it would violate Petitioner&#39;s Fifth Amendment right to be free from double jeopardy.</blockquote>The <em>Seattle Times</em> has <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008295492_watadaruling22m.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Settle had already <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-second.php">stayed court-martial proceedings</a>, scheduled to begin in October 2007, and later <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-judge-extends-stay-of-court.php">extended the stay</a> [JURIST reports], after Watada asked the US District Court for the Western District of Washington for relief while an appeal is pending with the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Watada, a Honolulu native who is the first commissioned officer in the US military to publicly refuse deployment to Iraq, has refused to be classified as a conscientious objector because he does not object to war in general, just to the &quot;illegal&quot; war in Iraq. He offered to serve in Afghanistan, but the US Army refused. His vocal protests and participation in rallies by <A HREF="http://www.veteransforpeace.org/">Veterans for Peace</A> and <A HREF="http://www.couragetoresist.org/x/">Courage to Resist</A> [advocacy websites] led to the charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and the original charge of contempt toward officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/gates-bio.html">US Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] confirmed Tuesday that the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] would remain open for the duration of President George W. Bush&#39;s administration. The <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/washington/21gitmo.html">reported</a> [text] earlier in the day quoted unnamed senior administration officials as saying Bush had decided not to close the prison before the end of his presidency. The <em>Times</em> reported Bush &quot;never considered&quot; recent <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081008/pl_afp/usattacksguantanamodetainees">proposals</a> [AFP report] by the <a href="http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/">Pentagon</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official websites] to transfer the detainees elsewhere. Instead, the president agreed with <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/vicepresident/">Vice President Dick Cheney</a> [official profile] and other advisers that immediate closure would pose significant legal and political risks. Responding to a question about the <em>Times</em> report during a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/10/20081021-2.html">press conference</a> [transcript] Tuesday, White House press secretary Dana Perino characterized Bush&#39;s decision as one &quot;to work to try to close Guantanamo Bay.&quot; She said: <blockquote>What the President has said is that he wants to be able to get into a position where we could close Guantanamo eventually. But it&#39;s very complex, it&#39;s complicated, it is difficult. There are four basic issues that we&#39;re dealing with right now. One of them is moving forward on military commissions. That process is slow, but it is moving forward. Another one is returning home or to a third country many of the detainees....

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Ecuadorean <a href="http://www.cortesuprema.gov.ec/">Supreme Court of Justice</a> and the <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.gov.ec/index.asp">Constitutional Tribunal of Ecuador</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday published a <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.gov.ec/actividades.asp?ss=18&id_nota_flash=13">statement</a> [text, in Spanish] laying out the first steps in enacting a system of oral arguments, as required by the new Ecuadorean <a href="http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/07/24/1212/1217/E8C064BD52EF420CAECDB655555BF60C.html">constitution</a> [text, in Spanish]. The constitution, which took effect Monday upon publication in the country&#39;s official gazette following its approval last month in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-in.php">national referendum</a> [JURIST report], consolidates and significantly broadens the powers held by leftist <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/modulos.asp?id=192">President Rafael Correa</a> [official website, in Spanish; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6187364.stm">BBC profile</a>]. The new constitution gives the president the power to remove Congress in the middle of a four-year term, to control monetary policy and to seek re-election for an additional term. It also includes plans to tighten control over Ecuador&#39;s vital mining and oil industries. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jGgKfm5OJSf-rkIcPDoBHIUsJxFQ">more</a>. From Ecuador, <em>El Universo</em> has <a href="http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/10/21/0001/8/B0371583D5CF48D6BC94F0E7C74A37B2.html">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />Last month, President Correa called the vote a &quot;historic victory,&quot; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN2834023520080929">commenting</a> [Reuters report; <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/noticias.asp?noid=15905">official statement</a>, in Spanish], &quot;Today, Ecuador has decided on a new nation, the old structures are defeated.&quot; The special assembly charged with rewriting the constitution <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-by.php">provisionally approved the document in July</a> [JURIST report].  The success of Correa&#39;s referendum fulfills his <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-president-pledges-new.php">pledge to rewrite the country&#39;s constitution</a> [JURIST report] after his leftist coalition&#39;s  <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-ruling-coalition-wins-majority.php">landslide victory</a> [JURIST report] in October 2007.  Correa&#39;s <a href="http://www.rafaelcorrea.com/plandegobierno.php">Alianza PAIS party</a> [official website, in Spanish] has a majority in the Constituent Assembly.   Critics continue to fear that the 444-article constitution gives the president too much control over the economy and the judiciary, which would allow Correa to follow the example set by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile] in using the reform to further expand his powers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mexico and Cuba on Monday signed a <a href="http://www.gobernacion.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=salaprensa&articulo=1249&pref=1&cat=0">memorandum of understanding</a> [text, in Spanish] aimed at combating the rising number of Cuban <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive] attempting to reach the US through Mexico. The agreement requires Mexican authorities to deport any illegal Cuban immigrants taken into custody by Mexican authorities, including immigrants who have illegally entered Mexico directly or through Central American countries. The agreement also establishes greater cooperation between Mexico and Cuba in the areas of human trafficking and smuggling. In a <a href="http://www.gobernacion.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=salaprensa&articulo=1247&pref=1&cat=0">speech</a> [text, in Spanish] following the signing of the agreement, Mexican <a href="http://www.gobernacion.gob.mx/Portal/PtMain.php?pagina=el-titular">Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mourino Terrazo</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said: <blockquote>Without a doubt one of the fruits of our renewed bilateral relationship is the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of Cuba and the Government of the United Mexican States to ensure a legal, orderly, and safe flow between both countries. This agreement also strengthens mechanisms to prevent and combat illegal migration, smuggling, and human trafficking, among other crimes. </blockquote>Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE49J87420081020?sp=true">more</a>. The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-mexcuba21-2008oct21,0,4209296.story?track=rss">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The increasing numbers of Cuban immigrants attempting to gain entry to the US through the Mexican border have been attributed to strengthened <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/air_marine/cbp_air_marine_overview.xml">air and sea patrols</a> [CBP backgrounder] of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea by the US <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/home.xml">Customs and Border Patrol</a> (CBP) [agency website]. Additionally, increased enforcement activities, including mass arrests of illegal immigrants by US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website], have put pressure on immigrants entering the US illegally. Earlier this month, more than 300 suspected illegal immigrants were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/hundreds-of-suspected-illegal-aliens.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] at a poultry processing plant in South Carolina. In May, ICE <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24583537/">arrested nearly 400 illegal immigrants</a> [AP report] during an immigration sting at an <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] meatpacking plant in Iowa, in what federal officials then called the largest operation of its kind. Nearly 300 of those arrested were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">sentenced to five months in prison</a> [JURIST report] and 27 more received probation after pleading guilty to the use of false immigration documents. Also in May, ICE <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/080523losangeles.htm">arrested more than 900 illegal immigrants in California</a> [ICE press release] during a three-week enforcement surge.

Although a lawyer for the men has said he might seek to appeal the sentence again, government officials plan to announce an execution date Friday.

Morales&#39; conservative opponents had sought such an assurance before approving the constitutional referendum, which required support from two-thirds of the congress.  The <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Bolivia/consboliv2005.html">current constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] limits the president to two terms, and Morales conceded that his present term, which began in 2006, would count towards that limit. Morales announced that the constitutional referendum will be followed by <a href="http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20081021_006432/nota_249_694169.htm">presidential and congressional elections</a> [<em>La Razon</em> report, in Spanish] in December 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/20/sudan20015.htm">accused</a> [press release] the Sudanese government of using a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">special prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] as &quot;window dressing&quot; to thwart an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation of war crimes in Sudan&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">applied for an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] in July for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] alleging genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, but such ICC prosecution is <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">permitted</a> [Rome Statute Article 17 text] only when a national court is &quot;unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution.&quot; In a move seen largely as a reaction to a potential ICC investigation, Sudan appointed its own special prosecutor in August to investigate and try war crimes suspects, including militia commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ali_kushayb_622.html">Ali Kushayb</a> [TrialWatch profile; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-05-01-07-3-Corr_English.pdf">arrest warrant</a>, PDF]. HRW said that Sudanese prosecution &quot;hold[s] little promise of bringing justice to victims&quot; and argued that an ICC investigation is precluded under Article 17 only when national courts &quot;charge the same person with the same crimes as those brought before the ICC,&quot; which is impossible given the limitations of Sudanese law. The Sudanese criminal code does not address crimes against humanity and genocide, does not recognize command responsibility for military officer prosecutions, contains many obstacles to sex crime prosecution, and provides immunity for members of the armed forces, militias and the police. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gY2h0GWEHPGxm1A7CsleuOfNEvOw">more</a>.   <br /><br />An ICC pretrial chamber is considering whether to grant the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">controversial arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for al-Bashir and has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-05-160-ENG.pdf">requested</a> [court order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/icc-judges-seek-more-information-before.php">report</a>] that Moreno-Ocampo submit additional materials in support of the application. Earlier this month, Sudan Justice Minister Abdel-Basit Sabdarat said the Sudanese special prosecutor has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sudanese-darfur-prosecutor-nearing.php">almost completed reports</a> [JURIST report] on some crimes in the region, though a time frame for trials has not been established. HRW has previously accused Sudan of <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/hrw-blasts-sudan-court-for-failing-to.php">failing to adequately combat war crimes</a> [JURIST report], stating in 2006 that the Special Criminal Court on the Events in Darfur prosecuted petty offenses while neglecting to address the widespread and ongoing human rights abuses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] wrote in a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=a/63/459">report</a> [text, PDF] issued Monday that the Iranian government has made limited progress in some areas of human rights but that other areas such as basic freedoms, minority rights and the justice system still need to be improved. The report noted that there have been marked improvements in per capita income, children&#39;s nutrition, education, life expectancy, and technical aspects of the justice system, including legislation that bolsters constitutional protections. These improvements, though, vary drastically by region. Additionally, Ban noted that many areas of human rights are still a cause for concern, such as in amputations and corporal punishment, the death penalty for both adults and juveniles, and the lack of women&#39;s rights, minority rights, freedoms of expression, association and assembly, and due process rights. He wrote: <blockquote>Some negative trends have also been reported, including an increase in rights violations targeting women, university students, teachers, workers and other activist groups. Ongoing harassment against human rights defenders, including women&#8217;s rights activists, has been reported. The independent media have also experienced tightened restrictions, with numerous publications suspended. While two Iranian- American dual nationals detained in 2007 have been released on bail, there were further high-profile arrests of members of the Baha&#8217;i community.</blockquote> Ban encouraged the Iranian government to continue improvements and to ratify international human rights treaties, including the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women</a> and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [texts]. The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28639&Cr=iran&Cr1=">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-36066420081020?sp=true">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Iranian government has drawn particular criticism lately for its use of the death penalty. In July, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iran-executions-increasing-in-number.php">hanged 29 people</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran in a move that human rights groups suggested was intended to challenge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-stoning.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report] of its death penalty policies. <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">said</a> [HRW press release] that Iran leads the world in executing the most people for crimes committed as children and advocacy campaign Stop Child Executions keeps a <a href="http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx">list</a> [advocacy materials] of those juveniles facing execution. Last April, an Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE14/014/2007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/iraq-execution-rate-now-worlds-fourth.php">report</a>] named Iran as having one of the three highest execution rates in the world, along with China and Pakistan. This past August, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-stops-use-of-stoning-as-method-of.php">commuted the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of four people scheduled to be executed by stoning and suspended the use of the punishment, after nine people were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm">given the sentence</a> [BBC report] in July for adultery and sexual offenses despite an Iranian <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/iran-to-investigate-judge-who-ordered.php">moratorium on the practice</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday issued an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/kiyemba-order-10-20-08.pdf">order</a> [PDF text] further delaying the release of 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur detainees</a> from the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives] as it set an expedited schedule for hearing an appeal by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. A three-judge panel voted 2-1 to stay this month&#39;s order by the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] requiring the federal government to release the Chinese Muslim detainees into the United States, finding that the DOJ had &quot;satisfied the stringent standards required for a stay pending appeal.&quot; The panel did not elaborate on its reasoning. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/judges_frm">Circuit Judge Judith Rogers</a> [official profile] dissented from the order on the grounds that the court had &quot;no basis&quot; for granting a stay pending appeal. She wrote, in part: <blockquote>The court&#39;s release order was based on findings that are either uncontested by the government or clearly supported by the record. The government had filed no returns to the writs filed by ten of the petitioners, and the returns in response to the remainder consisted only of the hearing records from Combatant Status Review Tribunals (&quot;CSRTs&quot;).... Although expressly offered the opportunity by the district court, the government presented no evidence that the petitioners pose a threat to the national security of the United States or the safety of the community or any person. </blockquote>According to the expedited schedule, the DOJ&#39;s brief is due Friday, followed a week later by a brief on behalf of the Uighurs and by a DOJ reply brief on November 7. The panel set oral arguments for November 24. AP has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/transfer-of-detainees-to-us-blocked/">more</a>. SCOTUSBlog has additional <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/transfer-of-detainees-to-us-blocked/">coverage</a>.<br /><br />The DC Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/dc-circuit-stays-uighurs-release-from.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] of the release order earlier this month as it considered the merits of the DOJ&#39;s motion for a stay pending appeal. DOJ attorneys sought the temporary stay hours after US District Judge Ricardo Urbina <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on October 7 that the Uighurs must be released, finding that the Constitution forbids their indefinite detention without cause. The Justice Department contends that Urbina&#39;s order <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/doj-asks-dc-circuit-to-stay-order.php">violates the doctrine of separation of powers</a> [JURIST report] as well as immigration statutes. Although the government has determined that the Uighurs are not <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000948---a000-.html">unlawful enemy combatants</a> [10 USC 948a text; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=enemy+combatant">news archive</a>], it has linked them with the <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4347">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [MIPT backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and has been a US-designated terrorist group since 2002. China has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">renewed its demand</a> [JURIST report] for the Uighurs to be repatriated, and on Tuesday, Chinese authorities <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iV-uvTizz_HbIySr1wBIREMDoQPQD93UT2D80">called on other nations</a> [AP report] to arrest and extradite eight alleged ETIM members whom they suspect of plotting to attack the Olympic Games this past summer in Beijing. The <em>New York Times</em> reported last week that the Bush administration&#39;s most recent efforts to transfer the Uighur detainees to other countries have <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/effort-to-relocate-guantanamo-uighurs.php">stalled</a> [JURIST report] because of an interagency dispute.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Outgoing UK Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4984788.ece">warned</a> [<em>Times</em> report] Monday against the expansion of government power in gathering intelligence and prosecuting suspected terrorists. In a <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/nationalnews/coming_out_of_the_shadows.html">speech</a> [text] delivered in London Macdonald speculated that present decisions about how the government should use technology are likely to be permanent -- an apparent reference to the proposed <a href="http://www.commonsleader.gov.uk/output/page2461.asp">Communications Data Bill</a> [official description], which would establish a massive database of <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i88NVo-m7hoB-cKYSjTBC1mlfqcAD93R29FO0">all phone and e-mail traffic</a> [AP report] in the country. Claiming a conviction rate of over 90 percent in terror cases, Macdonald said the UK was nonetheless right to resist &quot;special courts, vetted judges and all the other paraphernalia of paranoia.&quot; He continued:<blockquote>Of course, you can have the Guantanamo model. You can have the model which says that we cannot afford to give people their rights, that rights are too expensive because of the nature of the threats we are facing. Or you can say, as I prefer to, that our rights are priceless. That the best way to face down those threats is to strengthen our institutions rather than to degrade them.</blockquote> BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7680704.stm">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Telegraph</font> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/3230452/Centuries-of-British-freedoms-being-broken-by-security-state-says-Sir-Ken-Macdonald.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, Macdonald denied that there was or should be a real <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/uk-top-prosecutor-denies-war-on-terror.php">&quot;war on terror&quot;</a> [JURIST report] in the UK and criticized plans to extend the time terror suspects could be <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/top-uk-law-officials-denounce-proposed.php">detained without charge</a> [JURIST report]. Early this month, the <a href="http://cpt.coe.int/en/">European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [official site] released a <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/gbr/2008-27-inf-eng.htm">report</a> [text] expressing concern over a proposed UK <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7207659.stm">anti-terror bill</a> [materials; BBC Q/A] that among other things would let authorities detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.osc.gov/">Office of Special Counsel</a> (OSC) [official website] head <a href="http://www.osc.gov/specialcounsel.htm">Scott J. Bloch</a> [official profile] announced in a <a href="http://www.federaltimes.com/blogs/fedtimes/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/letter-to-the-president-10-20-08.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to President George W. Bush Monday that he will resign when his five-year term ends in January. Bloch could remain head of the OSC for one year after his term expires or until the Senate confirms his replacement, but the letter indicates he will end his term in January. Bloch&#39;s announcement comes after increased calls for his resignation following a 2005 <a href="http://www.pogo.org/m/gp/gp-OSCcomplaint-03032005.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] accusing him of retaliatory acts against OSC employees, violations of free-speech rights, unwarranted case closures and unethical hiring practices. In his letter to Bush, Bloch wrote: <blockquote>As you well know, doing the right thing can result in much criticism and controversy from every side. I am proud to have enforced your stated policy goal of upholding the rule of law, enforcing the law as it is written, not according to fads or special interest pressure. </blockquote> AP has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102003561.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Bloch has denied the accusations, but said that the OSC is cooperating with the investigation. In May, agents from the White House Office of Personnel Management and the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-agents-raid-offices-of-osc-head.php">searched Bloch&#39;s home</a> [JURIST report; NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90223448">report</a>] as part of an investigation into the complaint. Federal agents also reportedly investigated claims that he had destroyed evidence that might have supported the allegations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/DE/Homepage/home.html">German cabinet</a> [official website, in German] on Monday approved <a href="http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/nn_53532/DE/BMF__Startseite/Aktuelles/Aktuelle__Gesetze/Gesetze__Verordnungen/Finanzmarktstabilisierungsfonds__Verordnung__anla,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf">legal conditions</a> [text, PDF, in German] that the government will impose on banks that receive financial assistance through the German <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/__Anlagen/2008/10/2008-10-13-entwurf-finanzmarktstabilisierungsgesetz,property=publicationFile.pdf">financial rescue bill</a> [Financial Stabilization Fund Regulation text, PDF, in German; <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Artikel/2008/10/2008-10-13-finanzmarktgesetz.html">press release</a>, in German]. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7669381.stm">rescue bill</a> [BBC backgrounder], signed into law on October 17, will provide up to 400 billion euros to stabilize and revive the market through loan guarantees, up to 80 billion euros to buy problem assets, and up to 20 billion euros to cover any loan losses. The cabinet had proposed plans to impose a pay cap of 500,000 euros and bonus freezes on the CEOs of all banks that requested help under the bill, but under Monday&#39;s regulations, higher pay rates are only deemed &quot;inappropriate.&quot; The government is permitted, though, to analyze all risks in the banks&#39; business that could be excessive and to limit their implementation. In addition, any bonuses paid to employees must be &quot;appropriate,&quot; and each institution may receive only 10 billion euros for assistance and 5 billion euros to cover risks. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&sid=aOgJu5d0.qAo&refer=germany">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/business/worldbusiness/21mark.html?ref=business">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The passage of the German bill follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">passage</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month of a US <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h1424eas.txt.pdf">financial rescue bill</a> [HR 1424 text, PDF]. The final bill authorizes the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/">Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] to establish a Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions and to provide insurance and guarantees for any troubled asset originated before to March 14, 2008. It also establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Board to review Treasury actions taken under the legislation.

Montana officials argued in February 2007 <a href="http://www.doj.mt.gov/news/releases2007/20070201complaint.pdf">filings</a> [text, PDF] that Wyoming officials breached the 1950 <a href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/support.docs/YellowstoneRiverCompact.doc">Yellowstone River Compact</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/YRCC%20-%20Compact%20and%20Commission%20Information.htm%20">materials</a>] by failing to keep consumption of water from the Tongue and Powder rivers within the compact&#39;s limits, specifically by allowing the construction of water storage facilities and the expansion of irrigation.

Human rights groups, which had previously criticized the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html">Burundi government</a> [CIA backgrounder] for not actively prosecuting its own military officers for war crimes, applauded the prosecution. Bangirinama is reported to have fled the country and was sentenced in absentia. Three other military officers received life in prison for their role in the atrocities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The German <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/Startseite.html">Federal Foreign Office</a> [official website, in German] on Wednesday rejected a ruling by Italy&#39;s highest court ordering Germany to pay damages to relatives of civilians killed in the town of Civitella during World War II. The Italian <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] on Tuesday <a href="http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio-news/Roma-18:06/3369934">awarded</a> [AGI report] 1 million euros (US $1.3 million) to family members of some of the 203 civilians killed in the 1944 assault, which the German infantry carried out in response to an attack by Italian civilians. Reacting to the court&#39;s decision, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said during a press conference that the award is unenforceable under the principle of state immunity. German lawyers have also argued that Germany <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/ultimora/24ore/STRAGE-CIVITELLA-PER-GERMANIA-SENTENZA-INACCETTABILE/news-dettaglio/3371644">paid compensation to Italy</a> [<em>La Repubblica</em> report, in Italian] through a 1961 agreement. The Foreign Ministry spokesman would not say whether Germany would appeal the ruling to an international court. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hhRyZnO3rMOKJZLZqqYgGUmt9IGgD93VK4401">more</a>. DPA has <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3730911,00.html">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />The Court of Cassation <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_ottobre_21/cassazione_stragi_germania_c8b20ca4-9f87-11dd-b0d4-00144f02aabc.shtml">awarded the damages</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian] in a case against Max Josef Milde, a sergeant present at the Civitella attack, who was sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison. Under Italian law, crime victims may seek civil damages as part of a criminal proceeding. International agreements that govern situations in which a nation may claim immunity include the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/074.htm">European Convention on State Immunity</a> [text], ratified by members of the Council of Europe in 1972, and the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/4_1_2004.pdf">UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [text], adopted in 2004.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The death sentence of Afghan journalism student <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kambaksh">Sayad Parwaz Kambaksh</a> [JURIST news archive] was reduced Tuesday to 20 years&#39; imprisonment by an Afghan appeals court. Kambaksh was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/afghan-journalism-student-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in January for distributing papers questioning gender roles under Islam. In May, Kambaksh <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/afghan-journalism-student-appeals-death.php">appealed his death</a> sentence [JURIST report] before the appeals court. He denied the accusations in front of a three-judge panel Sunday, saying they were made by Balkh University professors and students with &#8220;private hostilities&#8221; against him. He told the court that his confessions were the result of torture by the Balkh province intelligence service. The <em>Times</em> has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4986956.ece">more</a>.<br /><br />Kambaksh was sentenced to death following his trial, where he <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/afghan-student-sentenced-to-death-for_25.php">had no legal representation</a> [JURIST report] and was allowed only three minutes to present his defense. The closed court invoked Article 130 of the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/af00000_.html">Afghanistan Constitution</a> [text] to pass down the death sentence, a penalty for blasphemy consistent with <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-hanafi.htm">Hanafi</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] Islamic law. Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai was put under international pressure to pardon Kambaksh, but said that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/afghanistan-president-will-not-block.php">would not intervene</a> [JURIST report] during the pendency of Kambaksh&#39;s appeal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="www.defenselink.mil/">US Department of Defense</a> [official website] announced Wednesday that it has filed new war crimes charges against two Kuwaiti men held at the US detention center in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Fouad Rabia, a US-educated aeronautical engineer suspected of running a supply depot at Tora Bora, and Fayiz Kandari, an alleged adviser to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Osama+bin+Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive], were charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terror. The two men, who have spent over seven years in Guantanamo, are said to have the longest-running Guantanamo unlawful detention lawsuits pending in the US District Court in Washington. Rabia and Kandari now face a maximum of life in prison. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald</span> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/737933.html">more</a>. <br /><br />The Defense Department&#39;s filing follows a decision one day earlier by the Office of Military Commissions Convening Authority to <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12302">dismiss charges without prejudice</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">report</a>] against five other Guantanamo detainees. Noor Uthman Mohammed, Binyam Mohammed, Sufyiam Barhoumi, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, and Jabran Said Bin al Qahtani remain in custody, and Chief Prosecutor Army Col. Lawrence Morris has appointed teams to consider whether to recharge each prisoner. Lawyers for Binyam Mohammed <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press_US_Military_drops_Binyam_charges_21_10_08.htm">called the move a &quot;farce&quot;</a> [Reprieve press release], reporting that they had been informed of plans to &quot;charge [Mohammed] again within a month, after the election.&#8221;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] has denied requests by former Khmer Rouge officials <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/158/D54_V_6_EN.pdf">Nuon Chea</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/157/A189_I_8_EN.pdf">Ieng Sary</a> [decisions, PDF] to receive court-appointed medical experts who would determine whether the men are fit to stand trial to face war crimes and crimes against humanity charges. Chea, known as Brother Number Two in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder], had complained that his brain was &quot;not normal&quot; and that his &quot;thinking [was] generally unclear,&quot; and sought a mental health expert to determine his mental competency to stand trial. The court denied the request Tuesday, finding that Chea has &quot;made collected, relevant, well-structured and comprehensive statements during hearings,&quot; and that his complaints about mental health fatigue did not &quot;in themselves justify the appointment of an additional expert.&quot; The court denied Sary&#39;s request on similar grounds, finding that there was no evidence his physical ailments or current medications could render him incapable of standing trial. AFP has <a href="http://www.mywire.com/a/AFP/Court-says-Khmer-Rouge-leaders/7921523">more</a>.<br /><br />To date, no top Khmer Rouge officials have faced trial for the genocide of an <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] who died between 1975 and 1979. Sary, former Khmer Rouge Foreign Minister, who has a history of heart trouble, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/khmer-rouge-war-crimes-suspect.php">hospitalized</a> twice earlier this year, and <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/khmer-rouge-ex-officials-appeal.php">appealed his detention to the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports] in December on grounds of ill health. The ECCC <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/155/C22_I_74_EN.pdf">denied</a> [PDF decision; <span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh</span> <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_myblog/Itemid,149/show,Ieng-Sary-to-remain-in-detention-Double-Jeopardy-issue-undecided.html/">report</a>] requests for his release pending trial last week, after <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/eccc-denies-khmer-rouge-second-in.php">denying similar requests</a> [JURIST report] by Chea earlier this year. The Australia government Thursday <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/24/2399814.htm">announced</a> [AFP report] that it would give the ECCC an additional $5.3M to assist it through two more years of operations, after the Court <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27144&Cr=cambodia&Cr1">announced</a> [UN News release] earlier this year it was facing budget shortfalls of more than $43M.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/Supreme%20Court%20of%20Nigeria.htm">Supreme Court of Nigeria</a> [official website] said Thursday it has reserved judgment indefinitely on a challenge to the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-ruling-party-wins-poll-but-eu.php">disputed 2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST report] which was won by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6187249.stm">President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile]. The challenge was brought by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Atiku+Abubakar+">former Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://www.buhari.org/">Muhammadu Buhari</a> [campaign website], Yar&#39;Adua&#39;s main challenger in the election, after it was alleged that the election was marred by <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">rampant fraud</a> [JURIST report]. The two men argued that there were violations of electoral laws that were capable of affecting the elections, particularly where the <a href="http://www.inecnigeria.org/">Independent National Electoral Commission</a> (INEC) [official website] had declared Yar&#39;Adua the winner before each state announced its results. Yar&#39;Adua rebutted that argument, saying the two had not proven that the election was not in compliance with electoral laws. Chief Justice Idris Kutigi said the court will inform the parties when a date is set for the decision. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&sid=aC6c9FANWEow&refer=africa">more</a>. The <em>Daily Independent</em> has <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200810240484.html">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />In April 2007, the INEC declared Yar&#39;Adua the winner of the country&#39;s presidential elections, prompting the filings by Buhari and Abubakar. The election tribunal, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-creates-election-tribunal-ahead.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] prior to the election in order to handle disputes, ordered the INEC to <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/nigeria-election-tribunal-orders.php">turn over certified copies of the ballots</a> [JURIST report] and provide information on all officials and staff employed for the elections. In February Nigeria&#39;s Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal upheld the results of the election, saying that opposition groups failed to present sufficient evidence to support their <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">fraud allegations</a> [JURIST report]. Buhari and Abubakar appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. Yar&#39;Adua had said that he would resign if the Supreme Court invalidated his victory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesman for Indonesia&#39;s Attorney General Friday said the execution of three men sentenced to death for their roles in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder] will be held in early November. The spokesman, Jasman Panjaitan, said that the three members of the southeast Asian terror group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>], <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2542863.stm">Mukhlas</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2499943.stm">Imam Samudra</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2632043.stm">Amrozi Nurhasyim</a> [BBC profiles], had exhausted all available appeals and would now have their sentences carried out. Most recently, Indonesia&#39;s Constitutional Court earlier this week <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/indonesia-court-rejects-bali-bombers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by the men that their execution be carried out by beheading rather than firing squad. Despite the Attorney General&#39;s position, a lawyer for the men said he still plans to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/23/content_10238939.htm">file a new challenge</a> [Xinhua report] to the sentence in the country&#39;s Supreme Court next week. The execution of the men, expected to be protested by thousands, has been <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-36134620081024">characterized</a> [Reuters report] as a test of the Indonesian government&#39;s ability to control extreme Islamic groups. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jW6SGCQar04uH-Vqp9x-zv_Pbhuw">more</a>.<br /><br />In August, Indonesia&#39;s attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/indonesia-to-suspend-execution-of-bali.php">postponed the execution</a> [JURIST report] of the three men during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, saying the legal challenge alone was insufficient to stay the sentences. A lawyer for the men had <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bali-bombers-filing-constitutional.php">promised to bring their constitutional challenge</a> after the Indonesian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/indonesia-supreme-court-rejects-third.php">rejected the third appeal</a> [JURIST reports] in July. Their first appeal had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/indonesia-high-court-rejects-final.php">rejected</a> late last year, prompting an unusual <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bali-bombers-bid-for-high-court-second.php">second appeal</a>, which was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bali-nightclub-bombers-withdraw-second.php">withdrawn</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, Indonesian police <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indonesia-police-arrest-alleged-2005.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] another JI member, Faiz Fauzan, in connection with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4300274.stm">second set of Bali bombings</a> [BBC report] in 2005. In March, an Indonesian judge handed down <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/indonesia-judge-sentences-jemaah.php">15-year sentences</a> [JURIST report] to two JI leaders, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140846.stm">Zarkasih</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6747349.stm">Abu Dujana</a> [BBC profiles], after convicting them of other terrorism charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in North Korea <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [press release] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28693&Cr=dprk&Cr1=">called</a> [UN News Centre report] on the country to take urgent action to improve its rights record. Muntarbhorn said the country holds public executions, punishes those who have unsuccessfully sought asylum in other countries, and has failed to cooperate with efforts to locate kidnapped foreign citizens thought to be held in the country. He also said that while the country has been generally cooperative with international aid efforts, there have been reports of long-distance call restrictions in a effort to quiet news of <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-10-23-voa23.cfm">food shortages</a> [VOA report]. Reporting to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] panel, Muntarbhor called on North Korea to cease these actions, and to make longer-term changes decreasing its emphasis on the military and promoting economic development and broader recognition of human rights. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jL3ViiD7I6FM56t-kCBwrjW31tWw">more</a>.<br /><br />Muntarbhorn made similar observations in January when he and a special UN envoy <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/ADE17C48D3104468C12573D400504F4B?opendocument">visited Japan</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/north-korea-still-violating-human.php">report</a>] to assess the impact of the North Korean rights situation on that country. In November 2007, South Korean aid agency <a href="http://goodfriends.or.kr/">Good Friends</a> [advocacy website, in Korean] said that the North Korean government has <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/north-korea-increasing-public.php">increased the use of public executions</a> [JURIST report]. The government of North Korea has long been accused of using the death penalty against its political enemies, among other human rights violations. In September 2007, the US State Department designated North Korea as a &quot;country of particular concern&quot; for its systematic repression of religious freedom in its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/">Report on International Religious Freedom</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/state-department-religious-freedom.php">report</a>]. North Korea has also been accused of <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-human-trafficking-report-cites.php">human trafficking</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-slips-in-world-press-freedom-index.php">press repression</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/north-korea-committing-crimes-against.php">&quot;actively committing crimes against humanity&quot;</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The High Criminal Court in Istanbul, Turkey, Thursday continued the trial of those accused of attempting to destabilize and overthrow the government of the ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website]. Turkish prosecutors have charged 86 people with involvement in the attempted coup, but Thursday&#39;s proceedings were limited to the 46 defendants who are being held in custody. The trial <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">opened Monday</a> [JURIST report] but was <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jkunAsgZf7JKhahB1XCR0XrsvsYQD93UF7680">adjourned due to overcrowding and &#39;chaos&#39; in the courtroom</a> [AP report]. The court concluded that the remaining 40 defendants - who are free on bail - will be present at the next hearing due to defense objections to the trial proceeding in two separate groups. AP has <a href="http://www.pr-inside.com/turkish-court-refuses-to-free-alleged-conspirators-r877630.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />The accused are said to belong to the secular <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder] group, believed responsible for bombing the headquarters of the newspaper <em>Cumhuriyet</em> [media website, in Turkish], assassinating Turkish-Armenian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>], and planning other attacks to provoke a military coup to topple the AKP. Among those on trial are journalists, intellectuals, and <a href="http://www.ip.org.tr/">Turkish Workers&#39; Party</a> [party website, in Turkish] leader <a href="http://www.doguperincek.gen.tr/">Dogu Perincek</a> [personal website, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/turkish-politician-charged-over-alleged.php">report</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court of Turkey</a> [official website, in Turkish] on Wednesday published its <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/eskisite/KARARLAR/IPTALITIRAZ%5CK2008%5C/K-2008-116.htm">decision</a> [text, in Turkish] striking down recent amendments to the <a href="http://www.byegm.gov.tr/mevzuat/anayasa/anayasa-ing.htm">Turkish Constitution</a> [text; <a href="http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/english.htm">materials</a>] to allow the wearing of headscarves in universities. Explaining the reasoning for its <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/amendments-easing-headscarf-ban-struck.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] in June, the court held that lifting the ban &quot;indirectly changes and makes nonfunctional the basic features of the republic.&quot; In the decision, as translated and quoted by the newspaper <em>Hurriyet</em>, the court wrote: <blockquote>It is decided that the amendment of Article 10 and 42 of the constitution implicitly violates the secularism principle at its essence as it would limit other people&#39;s rights and damage the public order by taking previous verdicts of the Turkish Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights into consideration </blockquote>In response to the decision, the ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] formed a commission to investigate the court&#39;s reasoning. Turkish <correction num=1>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</correction> <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE49M60W20081023">suggested</a> [Reuters report] during a news conference Thursday that the Constitutional Court&#39;s powers should be limited because it had overreached its authority. <em>Hurriyet</em> has <a href="http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=10179928">more</a>. <br /><br />The amendments easing the ban were <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkish-parliament-formally-approves.php">approved</a> by parliament and <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkish-president-signs-constitutional.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] by Turkish President Abdullah Gul in February. Later that month, the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkish-parliament-gives-preliminary.php">Republican People&#39;s Party</a> [party website, in Turkish] appealed to the Constitutional Court. While the AKP supported the amendments as helping to <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/turkish-pm-calls-for-end-to-headscarf.php">ensure equal access to higher education</a> [JURIST report] and to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkey-must-drop-headscarf-ban-to-aid.php">ease Turkey&#39;s transition</a> [JURIST report] into the European Union, secularists denounced them as violating separation of state and religion. In November 2005, the European Union Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/european-rights-court-upholds-turkish.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Turkey&#39;s ability to ban headscarves in public and private universities. Throughout Europe, banning <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=religious+dress">religious dress</a> [JURIST news archive] such as headscarves has led to protests and rioting, but European lawmakers have continued the trend as necessary to upholding secular values.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/terrorism/rapporteur/srchr.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official site; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scheinin">news archive</a>] Wednesday urged the UN to <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2008/081022_Scheinin.doc.htm">restructure or eliminate the existing terrorist &quot;blacklisting&quot; system</a> [press release; recorded <a href=" http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/unifeed/detail/10398.html">video</a>]. Currently, the Security Council&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/information.shtml">Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee</a> [official site] maintains a <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolidatedlist.htm">list</a> [text] of people and entities associated with the Taliban, al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and may act to freeze their assets, restrict their travel and prevent arms purchases by them or on their behalf. On the occasion of his annual report to the UN General Assembly Third Committee, Scheinin suggested that the Security Council be more open with information regarding the reasons for its proposed sanctions and favored the introduction of an independent review authority through which those listed could challenge their status. Failing that, Scheinin proposed abolishing the committee altogether, noting that it was created &quot;as a kind of emergency measure when there was no other framework in place&quot;. Without the committee, the UN would assist with identifying people and organizations to be listed, but would rely on member states to execute the sanctions. Scheinin&#39;s report came amid judicial challenges to and <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/03/04/global5839.htm">due process concerns</a> [HRW report] about the existing sanctions regime. Scheinin expressed concern that a &quot;wave of litigation&quot; would risk the &quot;whole credibility of the UN sanctions regime&quot;. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCSbGyLPOYbpf-Io3G-FoUhzDgYAD93VU8800">more</a>. <br /><br />Other groups and individuals have successfully challenged similar national international lists in the EU courts. Earlier this year, some European Parliament members <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/europe-lawmakers-call-for-eu-terror.php">criticized the EU watch list</a> [JURIST report] as unfair and opaque, saying that the process for adding names to the list should be changed. In July 2007, the Court of First Instance <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/eu-court-overturns-asset-freeze-orders.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] an EU decision freezing the assets of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman and the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa Foundation, finding that the EC did not give the plaintiffs an opportunity to challenge the legal basis for their inclusion on a terrorist watch list. In December 2006, the same court similarly <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/eu-court-annuls-asset-freeze-on-iran.php">annulled an asset freeze</a> [JURIST report] against the People&#39;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran. That judgment prompted the European Council to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/eu-overhauls-terror-blacklist.php">revise the procedures</a> [JURIST report] used in establishing and maintaining the EU&#39;s terror list.

The court annulled the 2007 decision as applied to PMOI, ruling that the council had failed to sufficiently justify designating PMOI as a group &quot;involved in terrorist acts.&quot; The judges concluded that PMOI had not engaged in terrorist activity since at least 2002. They wrote: <blockquote>In short, there is no evidence that the PMOI has at any time since 2003 sought to re-create any form of structure that was capable of carrying out or supporting terrorist acts. There is no evidence of any attempt to &quot;prepare&quot; for terrorism. There is no evidence of any encouragement to others to commit acts of terrorism. </blockquote>Although the judgment does not affect the council&#39;s most recent <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:188:0021:0025:EN:PDF">decision</a> [PDF text] listing PMOI among the individuals and groups linked to terrorism, it increases the likelihood that PMOI will be dropped from future lists.

The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/world/europe/24iran.html?ref=world">additional coverage</a>.  <br /><br />Thursday&#39;s judgment represents the second time since 2006 that the Court of First Instance has <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/eu-court-annuls-asset-freeze-on-iran.php">annulled</a> [JURIST report] a European Council decision regarding PMOI. In March, the UK Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/uk-appeals-court-blocks-bid-to-keep.php">removed PMOI</a> [JURIST report] from a national terrorism blacklist. Founded in 1965 with the aim of replacing first the Shah and then the clerical regime in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a> [JURIST news archive], PMOI has in the past operated an army inside Iran. The group officially renounced violence in 2001 and is now considered the main organization in the <a href="http://www.ncr-iran.org/">National Council of Resistance of Iran</a> [group website], an &quot;umbrella coalition&quot; parliament-in-exile that claims to be dedicated to a democratic, secular and coalition government in Iran.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A South African judge Wednesday gave prosecutors leave to appeal a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">ruling dismissing corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>], head of the ruling <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [party website]. Zuma is expected to become president after next year&#8217;s elections, although he has pledged to resign if convicted. Zuma contends the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/south-africa-prosecutors-charge-zuma.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] were motivated by ANC rival and now-resigned South African president <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/19/southafrica3?gusrc=rss&feed=worldnews">Thabo Mbeki</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], and their initial dismissal in September exacerbated existing divisions within the party. Mbeki was forced to resign last month, and his loyalists have threatened to leave ANC to form a splinter party. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE49L4PI20081022">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7684106.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Zuma bested Mbeki for the ANC leadership in December 2007. He was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> as the country&#8217;s deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but ultimately acquitted. The pending charges, which consist of corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering, date back to a 1999 arms deal.

Todorovic was previously charged with genocide before accepting a plea agreement reducing the charge to crimes against humanity. As part of the agreement, Todorovic agreed to testify in related cases. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49L5T3.html">more</a>.

According to the indictment, on July 12, 1995 Todorovic took part in searching Bosniak villiages within in the UN-protected area in order to round up the Bosniak population and transfer them an area controlled by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina . The indictment also alleged Todorovic took part in the July 13, 1995 capture of thousands of Bosniak men trying to escape the UN protected zone. During the relocation, Serbian forces summarily executed at least 7,000 Bosniak men between the ages of 13 and 17.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judicial panel of the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/lords/index.cfm">House of Lords</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081022/banc-1.htm">ruled</a> [judgment text] that the British government acted within its power in denying a group of Indian Ocean islanders known as <a href="http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/">Chagossians</a> [advocacy website] the right to return to an archipelago under British control. The group had challenged a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmfaff/501/501we16.htm">2004 order</a> [backgrounder] prohibiting permanent residence on the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html">Chagos Islands</a> [CIA backgrounder], arguing that the government had abused its power by not acting in the best interest of the territory. The government had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/01/humanrights.usforeignpolicy">argued</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that allowing the Chagossians to return to the islands would pose a threat to the US <a href="http://www.dg.navy.mil/">Diego Garcia naval base</a> [official website], now located on the largest of the islands. In a 3-2 decision the panel ruled for the government, holding that the order could be considered to be in the best interest of the UK as a whole, and was therefore lawful. Dissenting Lords argued that the order, issued under the authority of the Queen, should not be granted such deference because had not been voted on by Parliament. The Law Lords, is the UK&#39;s highest court and the last resort for the issue and the decision cannot be appealed. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/22/chagos-islanders-lose">more</a>.<br /><br />Approximately 2000 Chagossians were exiled form the islands to make way for the base in the 1960s. In May 2007 the UK Court of Appeal had <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2007/498.html">ruled</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/uk-court-upholds-right-of-return-for.php">report</a>] in favor of the islanders, and would have allowed them to resettle 65 islands in the archipelago, but not Diego Garcia itself. That decsion upheld a 2006 High Court <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/1038.html">decision</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-court-grants-right-of-return-for.php">report</a>] granting the islanders the right to return, but both are overruled by the Law Lords decision. Earlier that year, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/internet.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200604/05-5049a.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/appeals-court-rejects-islanders-claim.php">report</a>] in a similar suit against the US Department of Defense that federal courts lacked the authority to grant compensation to the Chagossians for losses they incurred because of the development of the military base.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Canadian government inquiry has <a href="http://www.enqueteiacobucci.ca/pdfs/documents/final-report-copy-en.pdf">found</a> [report, PDF] that officials of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) and the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canada Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) [official websites] &quot;indirectly contributed&quot; to the torture of three citizens while in <a href="/countries/syria.php">Syria</a> [JURIST news archive] between 2001 and 2004. The men, Ahmed Al Maati, Abdullah Almalki and Muayyed Nureddin, claimed they were <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/three-canadians-tortured-in-syria-seek.php">detained and tortured</a> [JURIST report] by Syrian military intelligence during trips abroad with the <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/campaigns/no_exceptions/resources/inquiries/three_canadians.pdf" >cooperation</a> [Amnesty backgrounder, PDF] of Canadian officials. In the report released Tuesday, former Canadian Supreme Court Justice <a href="http://www.torys.com/OurTeam/Pages/IacobucciCCQCLLDTheHonourableFrank.aspx">Frank Iacobucci</a> [law firm profile] found that officials contributed to the mistreatment of the men by supplying classified, and in some cases misleading, information to Syria linking the men to terrorist activities. In his findings on government actions relating to one of the men, Iacobucci wrote that the combination of the information released by the agencies was likely among several factors that led to his detention and subsequent mistreatment:<blockquote>The sharing by the RCMP of Mr. Elmaati&#39;s itinerary with the FBI and CIA is more proximate to Mr. Elmaati&#39;s detention than the sharing of descriptions of him with foreign law enforcement and intelligence agencies. However, it is reasonable to infer that the risk that Mr. Elmaati might be detained as a result of Canadian officials sharing his travel itinerary was increased by the fact that Canadian officials had previously used labels such as &quot;imminent threat&quot; in describing Mr. Elmaati to their foreign partners. Accordingly, I conclude on the evidence available to me that these actions of Canadian officials resulted indirectly in Mr. Elmaati being detained by Syrian authorities.</blockquote>In response to the report, Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2008/nr20081021-eng.aspx">said</a> [press release] the government would review carefully review Iacobucci&#39;s findings and was already evaluating government procedures for sharing information with other countries. CBC News has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/10/21/inquiry-iacobucci.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The three men were investigated by Canadian officials for links to terrorism but were never arrested or had any restrictions placed on their movements while in Canada, and all were eventually freed and allowed to return to Canada. The men and <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/">Amnesty International Canada</a> [advocacy website] sought the probe into their detention, arguing that it should follow the model of the Arar Commission, the official judicial <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/arar-commission-recommends-review.php">inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the circumstances under which Canadian <a href="http://www.maherarar.ca/">Maher Arar</a> [advocacy website; CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/arar/">timeline</a>] was detained in the US in 2002 and removed to Syria, where Arar says he was tortured. The Arar Commission <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/canada-judge-finds-us-arar-deportation.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that the US decision to arrest and deport Arar was &quot;very likely&quot; based on faulty, unfair and overstated information passed on by the RCMP.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/admin/directory/silbermann_jacqueline.shtml">New York Supreme Court Judge Jacquelyn Silbermann </a>[official website] Wednesday rejected a petition brought by two members of <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/html/home/home.shtml">New York City Council</a> [official website] trying to prevent a council vote on a <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/html/action_center/term_limits.shtml">resolution to extend New York mayoral and city council term limits</a> [materials] from eight to 12 years. Council members <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/d39/html/members/home.shtml">Bill de Blasio</a> and <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/d35/html/members/home.shtml">Letitia James</a> [official websites] filed the complaint to prevent the vote, arguing that voting on an option to extend their own terms presented members with a conflict of interest. Silberman ruled again them, noting that members opposed to extension could vote no or abstain. The council is scheduled to vote on the <a href="http://www.nyccouncil.info/html/legislation/legislation_details.cfm?ID=Int%200845-2008&TYPE=all&YEAR=2006&SPONSORS=YES&REPORTS=YES&HISTORY=YES">resolution</a> [text] introduced by <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] Thursday. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE49K4DV20081022">more</a>. Newsday has <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nyterm2312093798oct23,0,2865312.story">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Bloomberg announced his plan to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html">seek a third term</a> [NYT report], arguing his financial expertise and business background is necessary to lead New York through the rough financial times caused by the credit crisis. To seek re-election, Bloomberg introduced a council resolution to extend mayoral term limits from two to three 4 year terms. The current term limits were enacted in 1993 by city-wide referendum and upheld in 1996 again by referendum [NY Times <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E5D9133CF931A15752C0A9679C8B63">report</a>]. Critics argue Bloomberg&#39;s resolution overturns a decision by popular referendum with a council vote that requires only a simple majority to pass.

		<title>Eleventh Circuit permits sovereign immunity exception for false arrest claim</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200712874.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a physician who was accused of writing illegal prescriptions could pursue claims of false arrest, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution against the federal government. The court held Tuesday that a provision of the <a href="http://uscode.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001346----000-.html">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FTCA) [text] permitted such claims as an exception to the United States&#39; sovereign immunity. The plaintiff, Dr. Andrew Nguyen, fled Vietnam in the late 1970s, bought a practice in rural Trenton, Florida, after earning US medical licenses, and became a US citizen in 1986. His practice was decimated after he was arrested on suspicion of <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/STATUTES/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0893/SEC13.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0893-%3ESection%2013#0893.13">unauthorized delivery of controlled substances</a> [statute text] in 2000, even though the charges were dropped for lack of evidence two months later. In its opinion reversing a judgment of the US <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website], the Eleventh Circuit panel wrote: <blockquote>What happened to Dr. Nguyen&#39;s practice is what happens to the established professional practices of medical doctors who are caught committing crimes involving controlled substances. If the record before us is to be believed, however, Dr. Nguyen committed no crime. It is not just that the charges against him were dismissed on insufficient evidence grounds. It is more than that. The record, as it now exists, indicates that Dr. Nguyen&#39;s arrest was not based on any evidence of wrongdoing at all. All of the evidence that law enforcement officers had then, as well as now, showed that he was guilty of no crime. They arrested him anyway. </blockquote>The judges remarked that &quot;[t]he facts of this case show why Congress has chosen to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States in some circumstances.&quot;<br /><br />In 2006, Nguyen reached a settlement with local law enforcement officials who appealed a <a href="http://www.gainesville.com/article/20060923/LOCAL/209230329">$1.8 million verdict</a> [<em>Gainesville Sun</em> report] against them for allegedly violating the doctor&#39;s constitutional rights. The district court ruled, however, that the FCTA barred Nguyen&#39;s claims against the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website], which led the investigation that resulted in his arrest. Although the FTCA generally precludes claims within the scope of a law enforcement officer&#39;s discretionary functions, the Eleventh Circuit panel ruled that a 1974 amendment waived sovereign immunity to claims &quot;arising, on or after the date of the enactment of this proviso, out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.&quot; The panel noted that Congress passed that legislation in response to public outrage over the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907220,00.html">drug raids of the homes of two innocent families</a> [<em>Time</em> report] in Collinsville, Illinois, the year before.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/straw.htm">Jack Straw</a> [official profile] Monday <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/sp271008a.htm">called</a> [speech text; <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease271008a.htm">press release</a>] for a &#39;rebalancing of criminal justice priorities&#39; amidst outrage expressed at newly released <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] figures showing a sharp rise in the number of children born to female inmates. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Independent</span> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/number-of-babies-born-in-prison-soars-974458.html">reported</a> [news report] that according to official figures, 49 babies were born in prisons in England and Wales between April and the beginning of July this year, as compared to a total of 64 in 1995-96. Prison reform groups such as the <a href="http://www.howardleague.org/">Howard League for Penal Reform</a> and the <a href="http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/">Prison Reform Trust</a> [advocacy websites] quickly condemned the increase as inhumane and symptomatic of the over-incarceration of non-violent female offenders. In his speech Monday, Straw in turn criticized the strength of the UK prison reform lobby, arguing: <blockquote>We hear loud and clear about the needs of offenders. But what about victims? The government as a whole has worked very hard to give a central voice and priority to victims, but we hear far less often from these lobbies about the needs of the victim. I think that they sometimes forget who the victim is, so lost do they become in a fog of platitudes and debate over the &#39;needs&#39; of the offenders. </blockquote> BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7692438.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Last year, the Ministry of Justice gave authority to prison governors to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/some-uk-inmates-set-for-early-release.php">grant early release to prisoners coming to the end of their sentences</a> [JURIST report] in order to relieve <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4841938.stm">prison overcrowding</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The Ministry also announced that 1500 new prison spaces would be made available by the end of 2008. In 2006, then-Home Secretary John Reid outlined steps <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/uk-home-secretary-announces-prison.php">to combat the problem of overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST report], but prison populations have continued to rise since that time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge R. Barclay Surrick of the US <a href="http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/"> District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv04083/281573/">dismissed</a> [case materials] a lawsuit challenging the citizenship status and eligibility of Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) to become US president. The <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv04083/281573/1/0.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF], filed by Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg, had alleged that Obama did not meet the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art2frag5_user.html#art2_sec1cl5">constitutional requirement</a> [LII backgrounder] of being a &quot;natural born&quot; US citizen, arguing that Obama had lost his citizenship as a child when his mother married an Indonesian man, and had failed to reclaim it upon becoming an adult. Berg also alleged that there was insufficient evidence that Obama had been born in the US, and challenged the veracity of his <a href="http://fightthesmears.com/articles/5/birthcertificate">Hawaiian birth certificate</a>&nbsp;[certificate image]. Surrick dismissed the case, finding that Berg lacked standing to bring the suit because he did not face direct harm even if the allegations were true. Berg has said that he <a href="http://www.obamacrimes.com/index.php/component/content/article/2-news/45-press-release-berg-v-obama-dismissed-berg-appealing-to-u-s-supreme-court">plans to appeal</a> [press release] the suit&#39;s dismissal. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jvhtmoNEnyP1Bu6Ol4zJsN94mlewD941NCJG0">more</a>.<br /><br />A similar court challenge was previously made to the citizenship of Obama&#39;s presidential rival, Senator John McCain (R-AZ), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/us/politics/28mccain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">arguing</a> [NYT report] that McCain did not qualify as a &quot;natural born&quot; US citizen because he was born at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone, a military installation outside of US territory. US District Judge William Alsup <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2008cv03836/206145/39/">dismissed that lawsuit</a> [order, PDF] in September for lack of standing.

The delay also means that the trial will not resume until the next US president takes office. Both Republican Presidential candidate Sen. John McCain and Democratic Presidential candidate Sen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] said Thursday in <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081023100525.pdf">testimony</a> [PDF text] before the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official website] that the current credit crisis demonstrates a need for more regulation of credit default swaps and investment banking. The hearing was one part in a series examining the origin of the current financial crisis. Cox also advocated for oversight for investment bank holding companies, recognizing each regulatory agency&#39;s core competencies, and ensuring that securities regulation and enforcement remain independent. He described the need for a revised regularized system this way:<blockquote>The current regulatory system is a hodge-podge of divided responsibility and regulatory seams. Coordination among regulators is enormously difficult in this fragmented arrangement, where each of them implements different statutes that treat various financial products and services differently. Today&#8217;s balkanized regulatory system undermines the objectives of getting results and ensuring accountability.</blockquote>Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE49M5XR20081023?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>. RTT news has <a href="http://www.rttnews.com/Content/Policy.aspx?Id=751700">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month the SEC said that it has <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-242.htm">begun an agency review</a> [SEC statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sec-begins-accounting-rules-review-as.php">report</a>] of US financial accounting procedures, including &quot;<a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-234.htm">mark-to-market</a>&quot; [SEC backgrounder] rules, pursuant to the passage of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">$700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/">Manfred Nowak</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nowak">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/docs/GA_63_Statement21.10.2008.doc">said</a> [statement, PDF] Friday that despite numerous international conventions banning torture and other abusive treatment, its use is still widespread around the world. <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/B41633C8FCEA240AC12574EC0034096F?opendocument">Reporting</a> [press release] to the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) of the UN General Assembly, Nowak praised the 1948 <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a>, the UN <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention Against Torture</a> [texts] and other global and regional efforts to stem abuse, but said that the agreements alone had failed to improve conditions in numerous countries. Nowak said that the reliance of many criminal justice systems on confessions, combined with the isolation in which suspects are held creates conditions that promote and conceal abusive treatment. He also said that frequently the isolated, harsh conditions in which detainees are held themselves constitute inhuman treatment independent of any physical coercion, and that detainees with disabilities or that are held in solitary confinement are at greatest risk of mistreatment. Summarizing his findings, Nowak said in the statement:<blockquote>...it is very unclear whether the scale on which torture and other forms of ill-treatment are committed worldwide has actually decreased. Based on my work as UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, including numerous fact finding missions and unannounced visits to places of detention, I unfortunately have observed time and again that detainees are among the most vulnerable and forgotten groups of human beings in most societies, that the general conditions of detention are all too often appalling, constituting themselves cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that torture is still a frequent or even standard practice in many countries of today&#8217;s world. </blockquote> He called on countries which had not yet done so to ratify and implement the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat-one.htm">Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on Torture</a> [text; <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/9_b.htm">ratification summary</a>], which creates mechanism design to prevent such abuse. VOA has <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-10-24-voa57.cfm">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, thirteen UN experts <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/11D31EC19A6DCFA6C12574DA00389A5B?opendocument">urged the international community to respect the rights of detainees</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-special-rapporteurs-press-for.php">report</a>]. The statement of the 13 special rapporteurs, including Nowak and <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/">Philip Alston</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alston">news archive</a>], the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, came as the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] recognized <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/DetaineesWeekInitiative.aspx">Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week</a> [UNHCHR materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenya&#39;s <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/index.php">parliament</a> [official website] Thursday  passed a <a href="http://amanisasa.rescuekenya.org/media/blogs/kndr/TJRC%20ZERO%20DRAFT.doc">bill</a> [draft text, DOC] endorsing the formation of a <a href="http://www.khrc.or.ke/documents/Taskforce_Report_Overview.pdf">Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [task force study, PDF] to investigate alleged human rights violations committed in the country between Kenya&#39;s independence in 1963 and February 2008. The investigations will be conducted by a nine-member panel made up of six Kenyan nationals and three foreign members. Amnesty will not be given to any persons the TJRC deems guilty of genocide or other human rights violations. The relationship between the commission and any international tribunal that might be set up in the wake of Kenya&#39;s recent election violence at the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/kenya-election-violence-commission.php">recommendation</a> [JURIST report] of a separate commission of inquiry headed by Justice Phillip Waki is as yet unclear.

World leaders such as former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a Kenyan national, <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/annan-advocates-truth-commission-for.php">pressured the government</a> [JURIST report] to create such an organization following the violence that erupted after the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">highly contested presidential election</a> [JURIST report] in December 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ecowascourt.org/home.html">Community Court of Justice</a> of the <a href="http://www.sec.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official websites] found the government of Niger liable Monday for failing to aid a young woman who was held in slavery for ten years. The West African court ruled under a 2003 law that made the ownership of slaves a criminal offense, and a provision of the <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/CAFRAD/UNPAN002961.pdf">1999 Niger Constitution</a> [text, PDF; in French] which bans slavery. Niger&#39;s government will be required to pay 10 million CFA francs ($19,750) in restitution to Hadijatou Mani. Observers say the ECOWAS court&#39;s binding ruling will affect every ECOWAS member state may force a number of nations to consider the legality of slavery within their borders, as well as act to protect whose who may be illegally enslaved. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7692396.stm">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE49Q0HC.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Mani was sold into slavery in 1996 and released in 2005. She <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/former-slave-sues-niger-government-in.php">brought a suit</a> [JURIST report] against the Niger government in April alleging that they failed to protect her as she was sold into and remained in slavery. The suit also challenged the Niger customary law which states that a freed slave remains the wife of her master. The human rights group <a href="http://www.antislavery.org/index.htm">Anti-Slavery International</a> [advocacy website] estimates that as many as 43,000 people are still held in slavery within Niger. Slavery remains a common practice in many West African nations, particularly affecting women and children.

Opponents and supporters of the amendment have raised $32.3 million and $28.2 million, respectively. These figures do not include small donations within the last 30 days.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/index.php">Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [court website] on Friday <a href="http://multimedia.savannahnow.com/media/pdfs/davisstay1024.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] a provisional stay of the execution of <a href="http://www.troyanthonydavis.org/">Troy Anthony Davis</a> [defense website], which had been <a href="http://law.ga.gov/00/press/detail/0,2668,87670814_103214659_125286435,00.html">scheduled</a> [GA AG press release] for Monday, October 27. In granting the stay, the Eleventh Circuit directed the parties to address through briefs whether Davis can meet the stringent requirements of federal law that would permit him to file a second <em>habeas corpus</em> petition for federal review of his case. Davis was sentenced to death in 1991 for the killing of off-duty Savannah, Georgia police officer Mark MacPhail. In ordering the provisional stay of execution, the Eleventh Circuit wrote:<blockquote>Upon our review of the record, we conclude that Davis has met the burden for a provisional stay of execution. [citation omitted] Therefore, we grant Davis a conditional stay of execution and direct the parties to address whether Davis can satisfy the stringent requirements enunciated in 28 U.S.C. [Section] 224(b)(2). Specifically, the parties shall address the questions whether Davis previously raised his claim of actual innocence, whether he could have previously discovered the factual predicate for the claim through the exercise of due diligence, 28 U.S.C. [Section] 2244(b)(2)(B)(i), and whether he can show that the facts underlying his claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found (Davis) guilty of the underlying offense. ... Finally, the parties are directed to address whether Davis may be executed if he can establish actual innocence under 28 U.S.C. [Section] 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), but cannot satisfy his burden under [Section] 2244(b)(2)(B)(i).</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jhQApEoEL-uLsrCXRQzPN5FmpNXgD941GBAG0">more</a>. The <em>Savannah Morning News</em> has <a href="http://savannahnow.com/node/601947">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] rejected Davis&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-rejects-davis-death.php">petition for <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] appealing his death sentence earlier this month, lifting their own stay on his execution. According to defense lawyers, key witnesses against Davis have recanted their testimony, and others say another person has since confessed to the killing. The Court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-supreme-court-stays-execution-of.php">stayed Davis&#39; execution</a> [JURIST report], which had been <a href="http://law.ga.gov/00/press/detail/0,2668,87670814_87670929_121231342,00.html">scheduled for September</a> [GA AG press release], pending consideration of his case. The <em>certiorari</em> denial allowed Georgia to set the new October 27 execution date. The Court had previously denied a petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the case, and the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] in March <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/docket_search/results_one_record.php?docr_case_num=S07A1758">denied</a> [court docket; <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/op_summaries/mar_17.pdf">opinion summary</a>] Davis&#39; request for a new trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://council.nyc.gov/html/home/home.shtml">New York City Council</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://webdocs.nyccouncil.info/textfiles/Int%200845-2008.htm?CFID=2470582&CFTOKEN=21892286">resolution</a> [text] Thursday to amend the city&#39;s <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/charter/downloads/pdf/citycharter2004.pdf">charter</a> [PDF text] by extending elected city officials&#39; term limits from two to three terms of four years. The resolution, which took effect upon its passage by a 29-22 vote, allows <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] to pursue his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html">plans to seek a third term</a> [<em>NYT</em> report], announced early this month. The council stressed the importance of continuity in leadership during a financial crisis. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/nyregion/24termlimits.html">more</a>.<br /><br />On Wednesday, a New York State judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/new-york-judge-rejects-bid-to-halt.php">rejected a petition</a> [JURIST report] brought by two City Council members trying to prevent a council vote, arguing it represented a conflict of interest because it would also extend term limits for council members. Bloomberg&#39;s resolution was proposed too late to place a measure on the ballot in November, allowing the council to consider the issue. Critics have suggested that the council ignored the wishes of the voters and that the action would prevent viable candidates from running for office in 2009 because of Bloomberg&#39;s popularity and personal wealth. Twice during the 1990s New York City voters passed <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E5D9133CF931A15752C0A9679C8B63">referendums on term limits</a> [<em>NYT</em> report].

Al Bahlul is only the second detainee to go on trial in Guantanamo since it opened in 2002. He attended the initial proceeding Monday, but sat in silence. His appointed military attorney, Air Force Maj. David Frakt, asked to be removed from the case as per his client&#39;s request, but the judge, Air Force Col. Ronald Gregory, refused. Frakt then refused to participate further, boycotting alongside al Bahlul. Gregory said that the burden would lie with the prosecution to prove al Bahlul&#39;s guilt.

Al Bahlul, alleged to have been Osama bin Laden&#39;s personal assistant and media secretary, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/dod-lays-new-charges-against-two-more.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in February with conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and attacks on civilians, and providing material support for terrorism.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN-backed <a href="http://www.un.int/iom/GMG.html">Global Migration Group</a> (GMG) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.globalmigrationgroup.org/pdf/Int_Migration_Human_Rights.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; UNFPA <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/news/news.cfm?ID=1213">report</a>] Friday asserting that nations have a duty to protect the human rights of migrants even while exercising their sovereign power because it increases their ability to contribute to the development of their destination countries.

Former Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=del+ponte">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged last spring</a> [JURIST report] in a new book on her time at the tribunal that about 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of organ trafficking during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo. A spokesman for the Serbian prosecution <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=10&dd=27&nav_id=54517">said</a> [B92 local coverage] that the meeting was productive, despite the &quot;diametrically opposed&quot; opinions held by both prosecutors about what actually happened. CP has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHa8R2u5u13TaHudYH8HocDubZow">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, Serbia announced <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-asking-icty-to-reopen-probe-into.php">plans to officially request</a> [JURIST report] that the ICTY resume its probe into the allegations after Vuk?evi? <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/serbia-war-crimes-prosecutor-serbia-war.php">received &quot;informal statements&quot;</a> [JURIST report] from ICTY investigators concerning illegal organ harvesting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Myanmar court sentenced six leading opposition activists to prison terms Friday in connection with their involvement in pro-democracy demonstrations during the abortive 2007 <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-inside-the-saffron-revolution-403645.html">Saffron Revolution</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Independent</font> backgrounder]. All six are members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and each was sentenced to between two and 13 years, according to Nyan Win, a spokesman for the NLP. Senior party leader Win Mya Mya, along with another party member, was sentenced to 12 years. According to Nyan Win, they were all charged with &quot;inciting people to harm the peace of the state&quot; under Section 505(B) and Section 153(A) of the <a href="http://www.blc-burma.org/html/Myanmar%20Penal%20Code/mpc.html">Myanmar criminal code</a> [Penal Code text]. Win said that the NLD will soon appeal. This comes just one day after party leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] completed her thirteenth full year under house arrest. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j9ipc8YqLLUI-GdbQs8exVMEus-AD940VF300">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Bangkok Post</font> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=131627">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/unhrc-condemns-myanmar-human-rights.php">criticized Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] for its continued human rights abuses and refusal to cooperate with humanitarian groups. The resolution called on the Myanmar government to free political prisoners, stop recruiting child soldiers and implement earlier UNHRC resolutions regarding the country&#39;s human rights situation. Earlier this month, new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navanethem (Navi) Pillay</a> [official profile] said during a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28402&Cr=Pillay&Cr1=">news conference</a> [UN News Centre report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/new-un-human-rights-chief-calls-for.php">report</a>] that Myanmar continues to incarcerate an estimated 2,000 political prisoners, even after more than 9,000 prisoners were <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/myanmar-junta-to-release-more-than-9000.php">released</a> [JURIST report] last month. In particular, Pillay condemned the continued imprisonment of Suu Kyi, calling the detention illegal &quot;even in respect of [Myanmar&#39;s] laws.&quot;

The regulation covering persons from a wide range of countries would subject persons entering illegally, leaving again and then attempting to re-enter again to a two year &quot;cooling off period&quot;, and would affect thousands of people whose family members have received Israeli citizenship as foreign workers. <font style="font-style: italic;">Ha&#39;aretz</font> has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1031587.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The regulation is a partial implementation of a draft Law of Illegal Aliens currently being debated in the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Knesset</a> [official website]. Critics say it is unreasonable and expect it to be rejected by the courts. Israeli immigration policies have been a focus of controversy since the initial <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/allsite/mark02/h0206275.htm#TQL">Law of Return</a> [text] was passed in 1950. That law gives anyone who was born Jewish, of Jewish ancestry or has converted to Judaism the right to return to Israel. In 2004, the <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Israeli Supreme Court</a> [official site] <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/israeli-supreme-court-urges.htm">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that anyone who has converted to Judaism should receive Israeli citizenship. Last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/israel-cabinet-backs-bill-restricting.php">vote of support</a> [JURIST report] by the Israeli cabinet for legislation that limits the court&#39;s ability to review laws passed by the Knesset, could potentially play a role in the implementation of The Law of Illegal Aliens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.airforce.com/">US Air Force</a> [official website] is conducting an ethics investigation of <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hartmann">news archive</a>] over allegations that he abused his power and inappropriately influenced the prosecution of enemy combatants at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], military officials said Saturday. Hartmann was the legal advisor to the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commissions</a> [DOD materials; <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">JURIST news archive</a>] at Guantanamo and supervisor of the Office of Military Commissions-Prosecution (OMC-P) until he was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/controversial-guantanamo-legal-advisor.php">reassigned</a> [JURIST report] to the position of director of operations of the Office of Military Commissions last month. It has been alleged that Hartmann forced officials at Guantanamo to bring prosecution cases before they were ready, prosecuted an individual on charges that were unwarranted, and that he tried to get prosecutors to use coerced evidence notwithstanding their objections. The Air Force is also investigating complaints by two military officials that Hartmann exhibited abusive and retaliatory behavior towards them within the Office of Military Commissions. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gitmo25-2008oct25,0,669296.story?page=1">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/25/AR2008102502510.html">additional coverage</a>. <br /><br />Earlier this year military judges presiding over the trials of Guantanamo detainees <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khadr-military-judge-bars-brigadier.php">Omar Khadr</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-military-judge-disqualifies-pentagon.php">Mohammed Jawad</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/top-pentagon-legal-adviser-disqualified.php">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [JURIST reports] barred Hartmann from taking any part in the trials of those detainees on grounds that he was unduly biased towards the prosecution. US Army <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/leadership/zanettibio.html">Gen. Gregory Zanetti</a> [official profile], deputy commander at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/military-commissions-advisor-too.php">testified in August</a> [JURIST report] that Hartmann routinely bullied his counterparts and was inappropriately aggressive in seeking indictments against detainees. In October, newly resigned Guantanamo chief military prosecutor Col. Morris Davis said during his tenure Hartmann <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">questioned the need for open trials</a> [JURIST report] and was upset with the slow pace of the proceedings begun by Davis.

ASEM 7 is the seventh annual <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/asem/process/index_en.htm">inter-regional meeting</a> [ASEM backgrounder] between the heads of state of various Asian and European states, designed to encourage closer cooperation between Asian and European states concerning political, economic, and social issues. This year&#39;s meeting focused on sustainable development, culminating in the <a href="http://www.asem7.cn/download/bdsd.pdf">Beijing Declaration on Sustainable Development</a> [text, PDF], which outlines approaches for sustainable development with respect to rising commodity prices, climate change, energy security, and social cohesion. In his speech, Wen called for increased financial regulation in order to protect development throughout the world in light of the recent global financial crisis, saying:<blockquote>We should draw serious lessons from the financial crisis and properly handle three relationships. First, the relationship between financial innovation and regulation. We should advance financial innovation in a steady manner according to needs and possibilities and at the same time strengthen financial regulation. Second, the relationship between virtual and real economy. We should always place importance on the development of real economy and put the economy on a solid and reliable basis. In addition, we should coordinate virtual economy with real economy and enable the former to better serve the latter. Third, the relationship between savings and consumption. We should see to it that consumption and savings are well-coordinated.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jRXLXuJe4SNkn6X7KmJw_ca-tYywD941L8EO0">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/25/AR2008102500940.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">passed a $700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to limit the effects of the crisis on the larger US economy and international markets. The UK and other <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-cabinet-passes-regulations-for.php">European governments</a> [JURIST report] have since approved their own rescue packages, involving combinations of nationalization and backup funding for threatened banks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Yemeni security officials have <A HREF="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/21/yemen20035.htm">unlawfully and arbitrarily detained hundreds of individuals</A> [press release] as part of its campaign against northern Yemeni rebels since 2004, according to a <A HREF="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2008/yemen1008/yemen1008web.pdf">report</A> [PDF text] released Friday by <A HREF="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</A> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The report found that government security forces sometimes unlawfully arrested individuals who have committed no crime to pressure a wanted family member to surrender, silence journalists, or to put pressure on human rights activists. According to the report:<blockquote>Human Rights Watch investigated 62 cases of disappearance and arbitrary arrest linked to the Huthi rebellion.... In nearly all of the cases, arresting officials did not identify themselves or inform the detainee or his family why he was being arrested and where he was being taken. The families of persons forcibly disappeared did not know for weeks or months after their arrest whether their loved ones were alive or not, who their captors were, or where they were being held. Some still do not know.<br /><br />Most detainees, when they reappeared, did so at the Political Security Organization, the security and intelligence agency directly linked to the office of President Saleh, after having been effectively &#8220;disappeared&#8221; for weeks or months without<br />acknowledgement of their location. Some remain missing&#8212;the earliest unresolved enforced disappearance investigated by Human Rights Watch dates back to June 2007.</blockquote>Human Rights Watch urged the Yemeni government to establish an independent commission with full authority to investigate the alleged disappearances and unlawful arrests, and prosecute officials and members of security forces involved in the illegal acts. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ij4rlq3I7ZroOuOiCLxIU0v6F9RgD940SSHG0">more</a>.<br /><br />Since 2004, the Yemeni government has been fighting a civil war against Huthi rebels from the <A HREF="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/shabab-al-moumineen.htm">Believing Youth Movement</A> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The movement seeks to revive the influence of Zaidi Hashemites imams, which had been previously heavily involved in government in northern Yemen until 1962.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200810/07-7141-1145642.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the dismissal of a lawsuit brought against the <a href="http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/jordan.html">Kingdom of Jordan</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/countries/jordan.php">news archive</a>] by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2291649.stm">Ahmad Chalabi</a> [BBC profile; INC <a href="http://inciraq.com/pages/nobtha.htm">profile</a>, in Arabic], who led the US-backed Iraqi opposition movement during the regime of Saddam Hussein. The court affirmed a 2004 <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1353-23">decision</a> [PDF text] by the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] holding that Chalabi&#39;s claims were time-barred. Chalabi alleged that Jordan had engaged in a conspiracy violating the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_96.html">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> [text] (RICO) and committed various torts by seizing <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/05/04/petra/index.html">Petra Bank</a> [Salon report], which Chalabi founded in 1977. In its opinion, a DC Circuit panel wrote: <blockquote>Chalabi admits that the statute of limitations for his common-law tort claims is three years, and he does not dispute that his claim accrued when he learned of the plot against him in 1989. Nonetheless, he maintains that he properly pled a &quot;continuing tort.&quot; ... [E]ven on the continuing tort theory, Chalabi recognizes that, because he was aware of his injury as of 1989, his recovery is limited to injuries sustained within the limitations period that immediately preceded the filing of his complaint. ... Thus, to have any prospect of even limited recovery, Chalabi must at a minimum show that he was injured within that time frame.<br /><br />Chalabi&#39;s own complaint, and the liquidation decree that it quotes, preclude such a showing. ... Chalabi&#39;s position is akin to that of a car-theft victim who alleges that his vehicle was stolen a<br />decade ago and now complains that the thief is leasing it at below-market rates. Any current mismanagement is being visited upon someone else&#39;s asset. </blockquote>The panel noted that the district court&#39;s dismissal based on the statute of limitations was the &quot;easiest path to resolving this case,&quot; saving the parties the expense of discovery to ascertain whether the court had personal jurisdiction over Jordan. <br /><br />Chalabi <a href="/paperchase/2004/08/ahmed-chalabi-sues-jordan-seeks-to.htm">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in 2004, alleging that Jordan&#39;s government had wrongfully seized the bank and continued to smear his reputation by linking him with intelligence leaks to Iran. He claimed the bank seizure and embezzlement charges against him were an effort to keep him from revealing Jordan&#39;s illegal arms deals with Saddam Hussein. As leader of the <a href="http://www.inciraq.com/">Iraqi National Congress</a> [organization website], Chalabi was once a frontrunner to head the Iraqi government after Hussein was deposed. After counterfeiting charges against him were <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/iraqi-judge-dismisses-case-against.php">dismissed</a> for insufficient evidence, Chalabi went on to serve as oil minister and then <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/update-chalabi-named-to-deputy-prime.php">deputy prime minister</a> [JURIST reports] of Iraq for parts of 2005 and 2006.

In addition to calling for the prisoners&#39; release, HRW also asked Thailand to allow the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> [official website] to investigate claims of mistreatment towards the Hmong. Laos is a signatory of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], which prohibits, among other things, arbitrary detention.

Following SIEDO&#39;s &#39;Operation Cleaning,&#39; Miguel Colorado Gonzales, Fernado Rivera Hernadez, Jorge Alberto Zavala, Antonio Mejia Robles, and at least one other federal investigator (all from SIEDO) are accused of receiving between $150,000 and $450,000 (USD) a month from the Sinaloa syndicate in exchange for confidential information. The investigation also revealed that the cartel had at least one insider at the US Embassy in Mexico. A protected informant claimed that while he worked at the embassy as a criminal investigator, he was paid to turn over information about US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) officials and investigations in real time to the cartel. In 2008 he received $30,000 for his work. The informant claimed he did similar work for the cartel while employed by Interpol at the Mexico City airport.

AFP has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_295746.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Huang was noted for promoting judicial enforcement of constitutional rights, <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/china_law_prof_blog/files/1109_huang_songyou_qi_yuling_case.pdf">writing</a> [text, PDF] in a 2001 opinion that the Supreme People&#39;s Court&#39;s had reached a milestone in ruling that citizens&#39; basic constitutional rights should be protected. In 2004, Huang said <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/china-to-revise-death-penalty-law.php">changes to China&#39;s Criminal Procedure Law</a> [JURIST report] were needed because China had adopted a human rights clause in its constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/leon-bio.html">Judge Richard Leon</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/boumediene-order-10-27-08.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that in order to be validly held as an &quot;enemy combatants,&quot; Guantanamo Bay <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/detainees.php">detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] must have directly supported hostilities against the US or its allies. Leon made the ruling as a preliminary step in considering <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions filed by several detainees challenging their detention at the base. In his order, Leon wrote that courts should generally defer to the political branches of government on such issues, and that the key question was whether or not they had provided a definition of &quot;enemy combatant&quot; that comported with the President&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html">constitutional war powers</a> [US Const. Art. II text] and the 2001 <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> [PDF text]. He said such a definition had been provided in a 2004 <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf">Order Establishing Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> [PDF text], and he adopted it for use in the cases:<BLOCKQUOTE>the term &quot;enemy combatant&quot; shall mean an individual who was part of or supporting Taliban or al Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces.</BLOCKQUOTE>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gUxng-zkl2uhqdCATFQyY9_8QV3QD9430PPG1">more</a>. SCOTUSblog has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/defining-a-wartime-enemy/#more-8151">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In September, DC District Court Chief Judge Thomas Hogan <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-377">granted a government motion</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-extends-government-filing.php">report</a>] to extend from August 30 to September 30 the court&#39;s filing deadline for the first fifty factual returns in the <em>habeas</em> appeals of the detainees. In July, Hogan had called on the government to make the Guantanamo detention appeals a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-calls-for-speedy.php">top priority</a> [JURIST report] and devote all necessary resources to ensure that they reached trial in a timely manner pursuant to the US Supreme Court&#39;s June ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the Iraqi Central Criminal Court on Tuesday <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23329&Itemid=128">sentenced</a> [Multi-National Force press release] to death an Iraqi citizen affiliated with a Sunni militant organization for the 2006 abduction, torture, and killing of two US soldiers and the killing of a third US soldier. The trial and conviction are the first in which an Iraqi citizen has faced charges in an Iraqi court stemming from the killing of US military personnel. The alleged Iraqi insurgent, Ibrahim Karim al-Qaraghuli, was found guilty of the abduction, torture, and killing of Privates First Class Thomas Tucker and Kristian Menchaca, and the killing of Specialist David Babineau. The incident occurred south of Baghdad in June 2006. Al-Qaraghuli was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/28/AR2008102801136.html?hpid=topnews">convicted</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] based on the testimony of numerous witness, as well as on the basis of physical evidence linking him to the crime, including expert testimony that his fingerprints matched photographs of bloody fingerprints from the crime scene. Two co-defendants were acquitted of the same charges. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/world/middleeast/29iraq.html?ref=middleeast">more</a>. McClatchy Newspapers has <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/103/story/54892.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In September 2006, US military officials said that Tucker, Menchaca, and Babineau <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-denies-dead-soldiers.php">were not involved</a> [JURIST report] in the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl and the murder of her family in the near-by area of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mahmudiya">Mahmudiya</a> [JURIST news archive]. A group linked to al Qaeda released a video in July that showed two of the dead soldiers&#39; bodies and said the troops were killed to avenge the deaths of the family killed in Mahmudiya. The rape and murders <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/iraqis-increase-pressure-on-us-to-take.php">outraged Iraqi leaders</a> [JURIST report], prompting an <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iraq-begins-independent-probe-into.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] by Iraqis into crimes allegedly committed by US troops.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/officials/bonomy-e.htm">Iain Bonomy</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Tuesday warned former Bosnian Serb leader and war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/latest-e/pressindex.htm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/karadzic.php">news archive</a>] not to cause any delays in his trial and gave him <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/order-e/081028.pdf">14 days</a> [order, PDF] to respond to a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-mai080922e.pdf">motion to amend</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">report</a>] the indictment against him. Karadzic is representing himself and was directed to comply with all deadlines set by the ICTY in his case. According to Bonomy&#39;s order, the 14-day deadline will take effect when the prosecution has provided Karadzic with materials supporting its motion to amend the initial <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">indictment</a> [text]. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7695026.stm">more</a>. From Serbia, B92 has <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=10&dd=28&nav_id=54549">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Karadzic asked prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/karadzic-seeks-icty-information-on.php">release information</a> [JURIST report] regarding an alleged immunity deal with former US ambassador to the UN <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS profile]. In September, ICTY prosecutors filed the motion to amend Karadzic&#39;s indictment, as was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-to-amend-karadzic.php">planned</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. The existing indictment contains 11 charges against Karadzic, including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and &quot;other inhumane acts.&quot; The proposed amendments would narrow the indictment with the intent of calling fewer witnesses to testify and simplifying the trial. Karadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. He was originally indicted in 1995 but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report]. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">repeatedly refused</a> to enter a plea on the charges, with an ICTY judge eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-again-refuses-to-enter-pleas.php">entering a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST reports] on his behalf. If the court approves the amended indictment, Karadzic will be asked to enter new pleas.

The two lawsuits were brought against Google by <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/">The Authors Guild</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/settlement-resources.attachment/press_release_final_102808/press_release_final_102808.pdf">press release</a>, PDF], an advocacy group seeking to preserve copyright protection for authors, and by other plaintiffs including the <a href="http://www.publishers.org/">Association of American Publishers</a> (AAP) [organization website; AAP <a href="http://www.publishers.org/main/Copyright/Google/Release.htm">press release</a>], <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/">The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/aboutus/index.html">Penguin Group (USA), Inc.</a>, and <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?feature_id=1625&tab=1">Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</a> [corporate websites].

In return, Google will be allowed to display online up to 20% of the total pages of a copyrighted book, and will offer users an opportunity to purchase the remainder of any viewed book.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military judge ruled Tuesday that a confession given by <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsJawad.html">Mohammed Jawad</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohammed+jawad">news archive</a>] to Afghan officials following his capture in 2002 was obtained using torture and is therefore inadmissible at his upcoming <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] trial. Army Col. Stephen Henley found that Afghan officials threatened to kill Jawad and his family unless he admitted to throwing a grenade that injured three US soldiers in Kabul in 2002. Henley ruled that obtaining a confession using threat of death amounted to torture, and that under Guantanamo trial rules his confession is therefore inadmissible. Reuters has <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N28418500.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />Jawad, who was transferred into US custody after the confession to the Afghanistan government, was designated an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; in 2004. He was later <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2007/Jawad%20Charge%20Sheet.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">report</a>] with attempted murder and intentionally causing serious bodily injury for his role in the attack, which injured two US soldiers and an Afghan translator. The case against him faces growing problems. Last month, former military commissions chief prosecutor Army Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dnp-guantanamo.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report], citing &quot;ethical qualms&quot; with the military commissions&#39; defense counsel discovery procedures. In May, Jawad <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/guantanamo-detainee-files-motion-to.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] to have all charges against him dismissed, alleging that he has been tortured in US custody and subjected to the so-called &quot;frequent-flier program,&quot; in which certain inmates are moved between cells at two to four hour intervals in an attempt to cause physical stress through sleep deprivation. Jawad, the fourth Guantanamo detainee to be formally charged with war crimes under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">2006 Military Commissions Act</a> [text, PDF], is set to face military commission on January 5, 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://europeancourier.org/47.htm">Florence Hartmann</a> [book publicity interview] declined Monday to enter a plea on two counts of contempt she faces for allegedly releasing restricted information regarding court rulings in the case of former Serbian president <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hartmann was the former official spokesperson for chief ICTY prosecutor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla del Ponte</a> [BBC profile]. At the hearing, Hartmann lawyer William Bourdon said Hartmann was invoking her right to defer her plea for 30 days while she awaits the decision of the tribunal on whether she will be required to pay her own legal costs. In public statements, Hartmann has maintained that she operated within her rights and that the accusations against her threaten freedom of speech and transparency in the affairs of international organizations such as the ICTY. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49Q6G1.html">more</a>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Le Monde</span> has <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2008/10/28/l-ex-porte-parole-de-carla-del-ponte-accusee-d-outrage-au-tpiy_1111933_3214.html">additional coverage</a>, in French.<br /><br />In August, the ICTY issued an <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/milosevic/hartmannf/trialc/order-e/080827.pdf">Order in Lieu of an Indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icty-indicts-former-spokesperson-for.php">report</a>], charging that Hartmann knowingly revealed confidential decisions in the Milosevic case in her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peace-Punishment-Politics-International-Justice/dp/2081206692/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225237219&sr=8-1">memoirs</a> [Amazon book profile], published in September of 2007, and in subsequent public statements. Hartmann has continued to draw media attention, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/western-nations-blocked-karadzic-arrest.php">repeating allegations</a> [JURIST report] that the US, France, and Russia obstructed the capture of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>], and that the ICTY helped hide information about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukrainian <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/">Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website] on Monday withdrew a lawsuit she had brought against president <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Victor Yushchenko</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko+">news archive</a>] and the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cvk.gov.ua/">Central Election Commission</a> (CEC) [official website, in Ukrainian] challenging Yushchenko&#39;s plan to dissolve parliament and hold new elections. Tymoshenko said the challenge was dropped because Yushchenko last week <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11743.html">suspended his plan</a> [press release; AFP <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iosNEc3C4oSuNSi_e1COuQQcw0bA">report</a>] to hold elections on December 4, citing the need for the sitting parliament to take action on <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11744.html">financial difficulties</a> [press release] facing the country. Shortly after suspending the plan and reconvening the parliament, Yushchenko said he now plans to hold the elections by <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11763.html">no later than Decemeber 14</a> [press release]. It is unclear whether Tymoshenko will challenge that plan. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20081028/117984479.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, before suspending the plan, Yushchenko issued a <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/documents/8435.html">decree</a> [decree 922/2008 text, in Ukrainian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ukraine-president-dissolves-kiev-court.php">report</a>] abolishing a Kiev court after it <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ukraine-court-blocks-election-decree.php">tried to block</a> [JURIST report] his order dissolving parliament and directing parliamentary elections in the wake of the collapse of the governing coalition. Ukraine&#39;s leadership is divided in the wake of the 2004 <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050301faessay84205/adrian-karatnycky/ukraine-s-orange-revolution.html">Orange Revolution</a> [Foreign Affairs backgrounder] that brought Yushchenko to power as president. The populist Tymoshenko was originally a Yushchenko ally, but more recently has become disaffected, leading to the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11605.html">collapse of the government</a> [press release] over disagreements on both domestic and international issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Reports of hate crimes dropped approximately one percent in 2007 from the previous year but incidents of sexual-orientation bias crimes increased by six percent, according to the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/index.html">2007 Hate Crime Statistics</a> [report; <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/summary.htm">press release</a>] released by the US <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] Monday. The FBI reported 7,621 single-bias hate crime incidents -- those in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias -- in 2007, down from 7,720 in <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel07/hatecrime111907.htm">2006</a> [FBI report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/done-hate-crime-reports-increased-by.php">report</a>]. The drop does not necessarily reflect an actual decrease in hate crimes perpetrated in the US as the number of law enforcement agencies that participate in the study varies from year to year, though more agencies participated this year than last. Racial discrimination accounted for 50.8 percent of all reported hate crimes, followed by religious bias with 18.4 percent and sexual-orientation bias with 16.6 percent. Crimes motivated by ethnicity/national origin (13.2%) and disability bias (1%) were also reported. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jiCYFjVwQeFwkeHYaoBqXN7Z76sAD9435DU80">more</a>.<br /><br />Last year, the US Senate approved an amendment to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR01585:">2008 Senate Defense Reauthorization Bill</a> [HR 1585 materials] that would expand federal hate crimes legislation to include violent attacks against people based on their gender or sexuality. The White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/sap/110-1/hr1592sap-h.pdf">threatened to veto</a> [policy statement, PDF] the legislation, <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hUmscaJEWbsLqTXr7tKTevwWLaiAD93O6JOO0">arguing</a> [AP report] that there was &quot;no persuasive demonstration of any need to federalize such a potentially large range of violent crime enforcement.&quot; Last December, congressional negotiators agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/congress-drops-hate-crimes-expansion.php">remove the language</a> [JURIST report] from the bill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] Monday sentenced Steven Schulman and David Bershad, two former partners of the law firm now known as <a href="http://www.milberg.com/">Milberg LLP</a> [firm website], to six months in prison each for their role in a scheme to pay lead plaintiffs illegally in class-action lawsuits brought by the firm. Under the scheme, the firm agreed to pay class-action lead plaintiffs a portion of the attorneys&#39; fees if the firm won a case. Bernshad <a href="http://www.nyccriminallawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/071007bershad_agreement.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [plea agreement, PDF] to charges of conspiring to <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001503----000-.html">obstruct justice</a> [18 USC &sect; 1503 text] and <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001623----000-.html">make false statements under oath</a> [18 USC &sect; 1623 text] in July 2007, and Schulman <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/10/09/steven-schulman-pleads-guilty/">pleaded guilty</a> [WSJ report] to a <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001962----000-.html">racketeering</a> [18 USC &sect; 1962 text] conspiracy charge in October 2007. Both men already agreed to forfeit profits derived from the cases and each pay a $250,000 fine. Prosecutors in the case said that information obtained as part of the men&#39;s plea agreement was instrumental in prosecuting firm co-founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=melvyn+weiss">Melvyn Weiss</a> [JURIST news archive] for his role in the scheme.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US presidential campaigns of both <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Senator Barack Obama</a> and <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/">Senator John McCain</a> [campaign websites] are recruiting large numbers of lawyers to monitor and protect voters&#39; rights in the upcoming national election, according to a <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/us/politics/28lawyers.html?partner=MYWAY&ei=5065">report</a> [text]. The Obama camp initiated its <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/s/vpcvol2">Voter Protection Program</a> [volunteer website] targeting lawyers and law students at the start of the campaign to promote voter education, and it will deploy the volunteers to the polls on election day. The McCain camp is likewise <a href="https://secure.johnmccain.com/Secure/EdoSignup.aspx">seeking</a> [volunteer website] volunteer lawyers and law students to help during election day, and the campaign has also established a <a href="http://lawyers.johnmccain.com/Lawyers.htm">Lawyers for McCain</a> [advocacy website] group. These campaign-specific efforts are in addition to nonpartisan efforts by groups such as <a href="http://www.nationalcampaignforfairelections.org/page/s/vol08ep">Election Protection</a> [volunteer website], which has already recruited 10,000 people and which actively seeks lawyers, law students, and paralegals to work election protection hotlines, gather voting irregularity data and to run voter protection programs. Such efforts to involve lawyers in the election process increased following the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E6D61E3DF931A35751C1A9669C8B63">contested 2000 presidential election</a> [Supreme Court oral argument transcript] that pitted now-president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">George W. Bush</a> [official website] against former vice president <a href="http://www.algore.com/">Al Gore</a> [personal website].<br /><br />Earlier this month, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states had been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?hp">removed from voter rolls</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/voters-illegally-removed-from-rolls-in.php">report</a>] against federal voting law. That report added to growing controversy over voting laws and procedures in the run-up to November 2008 voting. In early October, both the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/default_highres.asp">Ohio Supreme Court</a> and the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ohio-to-proceed-with-absentee-voting.php">rejected Republican challenges</a> [JURIST report] to a directive by the Ohio secretary of state that would co-mingle absentee and regular ballots. Last month, voting rights advocates and elections officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/wisconsin-elections-agency-says-id.php">expressed fears</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/files/326371.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint text, PDF; <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/2008/nr091008_AG.asp">press release</a>] brought by the <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Wisconsin Department of Justice</a> [official website] will effectively disenfranchise thousands of voters there by causing chaos at the polls in November. <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen</a> [official profile] filed suit against the state&#39;s <a href="http://elections.state.wi.us/">Government Accountability Board</a> [official website], seeking to force the elections agency to cross-check the identities of recently registered voters against names in other state databases pursuant to the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) [FEC materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official website] on Monday preliminarily enjoined parts of a new state <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/08info/pdf-bill/tat/SB714.pdf">law</a> [SB 714 s. 589.426 text, PDF] requiring registered sex offenders to avoid most Halloween activities, suggesting that parts of the law as written are too broad and vague. The law, which was passed in June, requires that on October 31, registered sexual offenders avoid Halloween-related contact with children, stay inside their homes between 5 PM and 10:30 PM unless there is just cause to leave, turn porch lights off, and post a sign reading &quot;No candy or treats at this residence.&quot; The judge upheld the last two provisions but said that the first two appeared to be unduly restrictive and might not allow for registered sexual offenders to participate in activities such as celebrating the holiday with their own children or traveling out of town during the holiday. Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/cgi-bin/coranto/viewnews.cgi?id=EkkVEuZpFpWUPfZgNv&style=Default+News+Style&tmpl=newsitem">said</a> [press release] of the ruling: <blockquote>I am disappointed that some of the tough provisions we enacted to protect Missouri children on Halloween may not be enforced, but I am pleased that the courts agree overall this law is an important step towards further protecting our children from harm.  An appeal has been filed and I strongly encourage the Court of Appeals to reverse this decision.<br /></blockquote> The <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/us/28halloween.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A jury for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Monday convicted <a href="http://stevens.senate.gov/public/">Senator Ted Stevens</a> (R-AK) [official website] on seven counts of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1001.html">making false statements</a> [18 USC s. 1001(a) text] relating to an alleged corruption scheme and for falsifying his Financial Disclosure Forms. Stevens had been <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/07/29/Stevens_indictment.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-senator-indicted-on-corruption.php">report</a>] with accepting approximately $250,000 in gifts over an eight-year period from the founder of oil services and engineering company <a href="http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/energy/veco.asp">VECO Corp.</a> [corporate website]. According to the indictment, the gifts included home improvements, vehicle trades and other smaller gifts. In exchange he reportedly used his influence in Washington to improperly benefit the company and its employees. Stevens has said he plans to appeal his convictions and to continue his current <a href="http://tedstevens2008.com/">bid for re-election</a> [campaign website]. Stevens <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jW1hH6TiWjLmgj_DkK3XwN1x5XhAD943BVJO0">stepped down</a> [AP report] from his position on the Senate&#39;s <a href="http://appropriations.senate.gov/commerce.cfm">Commerce and Appropriations Committee</a> [official website] when he was indicted, and would have to be voted out by two-thirds of the Senate to be removed from office early. The <a href="http://ethics.senate.gov/">Senate Ethics Committee</a> [official website] has said that it will wait until the case is concluded before deciding whether to independently investigate the charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from Nigeria and from US pharmaceutical company <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer</a> [corporate website] said Monday that they hope to reach a settlement agreement by the end of next month over allegedly illegal clinical trials conducted in Nigeria by the drug company in 1996. The national government and the state of Kano <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6721771.stm">filed separate lawsuits</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2007 accusing Pfizer of administering meningitis medication to 200 Nigerian children - including 100 with the then-experimental antibiotic <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/trovan/">Trovan</a> [FDA backgrounder] - without the authorization of the Nigerian government or the consent of the patients&#39; guardians. They also charge that the testing killed 11 children and incapacitated 181 others, and demanded a total of $8.5 billion in damages. Pfizer has <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/files/news/trovan_litigation_statement_defense.pdf">denied the charges</a> [statement of defense, PDF] and said that the company&#39;s actions were both <a href="http://www.pfizer.co.za/RunTime/POPContentRun.aspx?pageidref=1874">ethical and beneficial</a> [press release]. Pfizer continues to deny legal liability. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssHealthcareNews/idUSLR43285320081027?sp=true">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gDWShc88BhB3lP5vCYQpIIh4u_HQ">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, a Nigerian court <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/nigeria-court-denies-pfizer-motion-to.php">rejected a request by Pfizer</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss the Nigerian government&#39;s lawsuit on technical grounds. Also last year, criminal court proceedings against Pfizer were <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/nigeria-court-delays-pfizer-criminal.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] at the request of prosecutors, who needed more time to prepare for trial.

His statement comes less than two weeks after North Korea <a href="http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/PressReleases/2008/prn200817.html">allowed IAEA monitors back</a> [IAEA press release] on the site of the Yongbyon plutonium reprocessing plant.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s08a1296.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that current state laws regarding sex offenders are unconstitutional as applied to homeless people. The ruling was in response to the appeal of William James Santos, a homeless sex offender indicted for failing to register a new address as required by the Official Code of Georgia section <a href="http://gcicweb.gbi.state.ga.us/cjis/ori/SexOff/SOR%20GA%20Code%2042-1-12.pdf">41-1-12</a> [legislative materials, PDF]. In defining the term &quot;address,&quot; subsection (a)(1) of the Georgia code specifically states that &quot;homeless does not constitute an address.&quot; Punishments for failing to register in Georgia are severe, ranging from ten to thirty years of imprisonment. A repeated offense of failure to register is punishable by life in prison. The state court determined that the current law &quot;does not give homeless sexual offenders without a residence address fair notice of how they can comply with the statute&#8217;s registration requirement,&quot; reversing the appellant&#39;s indictment. As an alternative, the court cited section <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/290-294.html">290.011</a> [legislative materials, text] of the California Penal Code which contains stipulations for homeless sex offenders to follow in order to comply with registration laws. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hTB__zALeygGBDvKZ3TQYpI6mDEQD942TIMG1">more</a>.<br /><br />Last year the Georgia Supreme Court <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s07a1043.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/georgia-high-court-throws-out-sex.php">report</a>] a law that would prohibit sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of areas where children gather on the grounds that it was overly restrictive. Earlier this year <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-jersey-court-strikes-down-sex.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indiana-appeals-court-partially.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] also overturned similarly restrictive laws.

Only the US, Israel, and Palau voted No; Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained. This is the seventeenth consecutive year the Assembly has approved such a non-binding measure, with this year registering the highest number of votes in favor. The draft resolution proposed by Cuban <a href="http://www.cubaminrex.cu/english/Ministry/ministry.htm">Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque</a> [official website] called for:<blockquote>all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures...[that]...affect the sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and navigation...[and to conform with]...their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law. </blockquote>Member envoys supporting the resolution said the economic blockade <a href="http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/ga/63/2008/ga081029am.rm">violated Cuba&#39;s sovereignty and the human rights of its people</a> [recorded video] contrary to the <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/">UN Charter</a> [text]. US envoy <a href="http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bios/g/1914.htm">Ronald Godard</a> [official profile] said the US not only has the right to impose economic sanctions, but is also justified to &quot;limit the ability of Cuba&#39;s repressive government to benefit and consolidate power through its authoritarian control over the Cuban economy.&quot; Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSTRE49S6V020081029?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=10112&sp=true%20http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/63/L.4&Lang=E">more</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3182150.stm">Relations between Cuba and the US</a> [BBC timeline] have been dominated by the US economic blockade against Cuba for the past 46 years. The US has continued to impose increasingly stricter sanctions on the communist island. The most recent were enacted during the Bush and Clinton administrations, and include the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.927.ENR:">Helms-Burton Act</a> [text] and restrictions on travel and aid between families.

Although Rutherford indicated Khawja may not have known about the terrorist plot, he was found guilty of participating in a terrorist group, instructing a person to finance terrorism, making property available to terrorists, contributing to a terrorist group, and facilitating terrorism under Canada&#39;s controversial <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=e&chamber=n&startlist=a&endlist=z&session=9&type=0&scope=i&query=2981&list=toc-1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text; CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/">backgrounder</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in military-ruled <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1300003.stm">Myanmar</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Myanmar">news archive</a>] on Wednesday sentenced nine activists to six months in prison after they complained that their trials were being held in secret, according to a statement by one of their lawyers speaking to Reuters. The presiding judge at the trial in Yangon&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3006922.stm">Insein Prison</a> [BBC backgrounder] ruled that the activists had interrupted a public servant at a judicial proceeding by repeatedly asking for an open trial that relatives could attend. The judge asked the lawyers to leave the courtroom and then sentenced the activists to six months in prison. The activists continue to face several charges, including the violation of a law banning demonstrations, speeches, or written statements that could undermine stability. It is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE49T3TR20081030">more</a>.<br /><br />Most of the nine activists are leading members of the Burmese opposition <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6958363.stm">88 Generation Students movement</a> [BBC backgrounder], a group of pro-democracy dissidents who were active during the country&#8217;s uprising in 1988. Nearly all of them were arrested in August 2007 during large anti-government street rallies led by Buddhist monks which were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/myanmar-police-arrest-dozens-as-protest.php">violently suppressed</a> [JURIST report] by the military government. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D6AAED437FC007C1C125741A0071E9CB?opendocument">resolution</a> [press release] last March condemning Myanmar for ongoing systematic violations of human rights and people&#39;s fundamental freedoms. The European Union (EU) has also expressed concern over human rights violations in the country and the lack of investigations in the aftermath of last year&#39;s violent government suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. According to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], more than 2,100 people are <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/myanmar-freedom-u-win-tin-2100-political-prisoners-remain-behind-bars-20">imprisoned</a> [Amnesty report] in Myanmar on account of their political or religious beliefs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A criminal court sitting in Damascus Wednesday sentenced twelve dissidents accused of inciting sectarian strife to two and a half years in prison, according to the <a href="http://nohr-s.org/fs/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=36&Itemid=56">National Organization for Human Rights in Syria</a> [advocacy website]. The convicted were all leaders of the pro-democracy <a href="http://nidaasyria.org/en/news/damascus-declaration-leaders-sentenced">Damascus Declaration for Democratic National Change</a> (DDDNC) [press release] group. They were found guilty on <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/pro-democracy-activists-in-syria-face-15-years-in-prison-20081008">charges</a> [Amnesty International report] of weakening national sentiment, broadcasting false or exaggerated news that could affect the morale of the country, joining an organization formed with the purpose of changing the financial or social status of the state, and inciting sectarian strife. The activists were arrested in December 2007 and January 2008 after taking part in a meeting of the DDDNC. The original sentence was 6 years but it was reduced by the judge without any explanation. The convicted can appeal for up to 30 days. Several other DDDNC meeting participants were arrested but later released without charge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman </a>[official website] announced Wednesday he is calling a special session of the state legislature on November 14 to amend <a href="http://uniweb.legislature.ne.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Final/LB157.pdf">Nebraska&#39;s so-called &#39;safe haven&#39; law</a> [LB 157 text, PDF]. The law, which went into effect in July, was intended to protect infants and prohibits prosecution of parents when a child is left in a licensed hospital. Under broad interpretation of the term &quot;child,&quot; however, parents have legally abandoned several children in their late teens. Since July, nearly two dozen children have been dropped off in hospitals, and Nebraska lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/nebraska-lawmakers-call-parental-safe.php">said that the law is too broad</a> [JURIST report]. In a <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/news/2008/2008_10/29_safe_haven.html">press release</a> [text], the governor said: <blockquote>This law needs to be changed to focus on its original intent, which is to protect infants...A proposed three day safe haven law that the legislature has agreed to will be introduced by Speaker Flood on my behalf.</blockquote>The new law will only permit parents to drop off children up to three days old. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/us/30haven.html">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Omaha Newsstand</span> has <a href="http://omahanewsstand.com/site/?brd=2712&pag=461&cat_id=403&newsid=20170959&rfi=16">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Nebraska was the last of the fifty US states to enact its <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/safehaven.cfm">infant safe haven law </a>[Child Welfare Information Gateway backgrounder], but all of the others apply strictly to children under one year old. Nationwide, there are different requirements for what constitutes a &quot;safe haven:&quot; in some states, like Nebraska, infants may only be relinquished to a hospital; in others, licensed personnel at emergency medical services, police stations, and fire stations can accept infants. In most states, once the safe haven provider has informed the local child services department that an infant has been abandoned, the department takes responsibility for the child and petitions the court for termination of the parent&#39;s parental rights.

Critics of the measure counter that the law is too broad and could hinder cultural art such as temple statues, and some were quoted Thursday as saying they would pursue legal challenges to it. The law was revised several times before being passed by parliament. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin -->AFP has <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/081030/world/indonesia_pornography_law">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0392p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=598">press release</a>] an injunction granted by a federal judge earlier this month ordering Michigan voting officials to reinstate on voter rolls the names of newly-registered voters whose voter registration cards were returned to the post office as undeliverable. The <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/index.php">ACLU of Michigan</a> [advocacy website] had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/images/asset_upload_file359_36841.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] the new Michigan state law, which permitted nullification of such voter registrations, on the grounds that it violated the 1993 <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/nvra/activ_nvra.htm">National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA) [official backgrounder], which sets forth conditions that must be met before an individual can be removed from voting rolls. In a 2-1 opinion, the Sixth Circuit agreed, holding:<blockquote>[T]here has never been a determination [here] that the [removed] voters are ineligible....[T]he preliminary injunction is necessary to protect the individual voters of Michigan affected by the undeliverable-voter-ID-card practice....[It] ensures that each individual who has properly registered to vote but was removed due to an error that is out of his or her control will be able to case a ballot on election day.<br /></blockquote>The NVRA allows registered voters to remain on voter rolls for at least two federal elections after registration cards have been returned as undeliverable. AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081030/ap_on_el_ge/michigan_voter_registration_2">more</a>.<br /><br />There have been a growing number of controversies over voting laws and procedures in the run-up to November 2008 voting. Earlier this month, the <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> released a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?hp">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/voters-illegally-removed-from-rolls-in.php">report</a>] alleging that thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states, including Michigan, have been removed from voter rolls against federal voting law. The report examined the actions of election officials in Colorado, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina, and found that the removal of a number of registered voters violated the <a href="http://fec.gov/hava/law_ext.txt">Help America Vote Act</a> (HAVA) [text]. The campaigns of both <a target="_blank" href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Senator Barack Obama</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.johnmccain.com/">Senator John McCain</a> [campaign websites] are <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/presidential-campaigns-recruiting.php">recruiting thousands of volunteer lawyers</a> [JURIST report] to help protect voters&#39; rights on election day.

In an address to the <a href="http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=361">Croatian parliament</a> [official website], Simonovic suggested establishing special courts to try organized crime and corruption suspects in the cities of Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. Other proposed measures included improving witness protection methods, expanding property seizure rules, and restricting the communication access of incarcerated organized criminals. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7697713.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Combating organized crime is a major requirement for the former Yugoslav republic&#39;s <a href="http://www.eu-pregovori.hr/default.asp?jezik=2">accession to the European Union</a> (EU) [government website]. While improvements were noted in a <a href="http://www.mvpei.hr/ei/download/2007/11/14/Croatia_Progress_Reports__2007_en.pdf">2007 progress report</a> [text, PDF], a recent rise in violence could cast a shadow on the 2008 report due out next month. Last week Ivo Pukanic, the founder and editor-in-chief of the outspoken newsmagazine <a href="http://www.nacional.hr/en/"><em>Nacional</em></a> [media website] was <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jTAS7xJkFuCvtJshKf2tiOsWcAOgD9410GD81">killed in a car explosion</a> [AP report] blamed on criminal elements.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://english.ccourt.go.kr/">Constitutional Court of South Korea</a> [official website] upheld a law criminalizing adultery on Thursday, rejecting complaints that the 55-year-old law is outdated and constitutes an invasion of privacy. The challenge was brought by the lawyers of popular South Korean actress Ok So Ri, who was <a href="http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2887278">charged under the law</a> [<em>JoongAng Daily</em> backgrounder] when her husband filed a criminal complaint against her for having an extramarital affair with an opera singer. Although only four of the nine judges supported the ban, the law remains valid; South Korean law requires a minimum of six judges oppose a statute in order to abolish it. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKTRE49T26S20081030">more</a>. The <em>Korea Times</em> has <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/117_33571.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Although it is rare for people to be jailed in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=south+korea">South Korea</a> [JURIST news archive] under the adultery law &#8211; in 2007, only 47 people were jailed while 592 were given suspended sentences &#8211; thousands of spouses continue to file criminal complaints. In 2005, a group of South Korean lawmakers introduced a parliamentary proposal to scrap the law, but backlash from conservative voters caused the effort to stall. Ri&#39;s challenge marks the fourth such challenge since 1989, with previous challenges brought in 1990, 1993 and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1619339.stm">2001</a> [BBC report].

Exemption 3 prohibits agencies from releasing any materials that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, provided there are particular criteria.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/">Department of Justice Antitrust Division</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2008/238849.htm">approved</a> [press release] a merger of <a href="http://www.delta.com/about_delta/index.jsp">Delta Airlines</a> and <a href="http://www.nwa.com/corpinfo/">Northwest Airlines</a> [corporate websites] after determining the deal would not significantly decrease competition. The department said the merger would likely decrease operational costs for the carriers that would benefit customers, and was not likely to harm the industry:<br /><blockquote>The two airlines currently compete with a number of other legacy and low cost airlines in the provision of scheduled air passenger service on the vast majority of nonstop and connecting routes where they compete with each other. In addition, the merger likely will result in efficiencies such as cost savings in airport operations, information technology, supply chain economics, and fleet optimization that will benefit consumers. Consumers are also likely to benefit from improved service made possible by combining under single ownership the complementary aspects of the airlines&#39; networks.</blockquote> Northwest will now be a subsidiary of Delta and will form the world&#39;s largest airline. In a <a href="http://news.delta.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=11176">statement on the merger</a> [press release], Delta said it expected annual savings of more than $2 billion because of the deal. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZCchAodBiyCgZ-tYEScQoF-TTkA">more</a>.<br /><br />Delta and Northwest had previously faced financial trouble, and in 2005 both <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/delta-northwest-airlines-file-for.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/bankrupt.htm">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> [SEC backgrounder]. Because of its bankruptcy, Delta was able to <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/bankruptcy-judge-approves-delta.php">settle a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by pilots after it announced that it would be ending its pension plan. Northwest also successfully gained concessions from both <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/flight-attendants-union-settles-with.php">flight attendants</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/pilots-union-finally-settles-with.php">pilots</a> [JURIST reports] after its filing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official website] on Wednesday issued a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081029102934.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] revealing that top <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] officials opposed FDA regulations that preempt consumers&#8217; ability to bring tort claims against drug manufacturers. The report said that career FDA officials objected to a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/labelcf.pdf">2006 regulation</a> [text, PDF] revising the so-called Physician Labeling Rule because under it the agency&#8217;s approval of labeling preempted conflicting state law, significantly limiting the liability of drug makers. Prominent FDA staffers had maintained that state lawsuits complement the agency&#8217;s regulatory function by discovering risks that it cannot. The regulation also made it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to add new warnings to existing drug labels. The report shows that Jane Axelrad, an FDA research director, expressed reservations about the rationale for lowering label content requirements:<blockquote>[T]here are continued references to sponsors &#39;disclosing too much&#39; risk information and its adverse impact.&#8230;We rarely find ourselves in situations where sponsors want to disclose more risk information than we think is necessary. To the contrary, we usually find ourselves dealing with situations where sponsors want to minimize the risk information.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-10-29-3332938056_x.htm?loc=interstitialskip">more</a>.<br /><br />The initial Physician Labeling Rule, as proposed in 2000, did not preempt state law. The FDA bolstered labeling restrictions with an <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Cber/rules/suplabelchngfr.pdf">August 2008 regulation</a> [text, PDF] stating that manufacturers may not strengthen warnings except when there is &quot;sufficient evidence of causal association with the drug.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ecuador selected a new temporary Supreme Court on Wednesday via lottery, but the judges picked plan to reject their appointments. The previous Supreme Court was abolished under a new <a href="http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/07/24/1212/1217/E8C064BD52EF420CAECDB655555BF60C.html">constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] that took effect last week. The temporary court that has now been set up in its place has designated 21 out of 31 former judges as members by lot and will operate until a permanent court takes over in 2009. Last week the judges of the previous Supreme Court released a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/28/news/LT-Ecuador-Court-by-Lottery.php">statement</a> [AP report] indicating their refusal to fill seats that have been selected by a process that they deemed degrading. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hsdGBfVDqexHLxfB7dWToyiAguZwD944GFC00">more</a>.<br /><br />The new constitution, approved in September by a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-in.php">referendum</a> [JURIST, report], establishes a transitional regime that will govern until general elections in 2009. Last week the old Supreme Court took the first steps toward <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ecuador-high-court-creates-oral.php">creating a new oral argument system</a> [JURIST report], as required by the new charter. Critics continue to fear the 444-article document gives the president too much control over the economy and the judiciary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday called for the addition of a clause to the pending <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/17/excerpts-from-draft-us-iraqi-security-agreement/?page=2">US-Iraqi security agreement</a> [released excerpts, text] that would <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/iraq20098.htm">shield detainees from transfer to Iraqi custody</a> [press release] in order to avoid risk of torture. The group wants a provision that would allow prisoners a &quot;legitimate chance&quot; to contest their transfer, along with provisions that would permit the US to inspect Iraqi detention facilities before final transfers take place. If approved, the security agreement would require that the US receive permission before making all future arrests and that all new suspects be turned over to Iraqi control within 24 hours. The terms of the transfer of about 17,000 detainees currently being held by the US in Iraq are not specified. Iraqi authorities admit that they are not prepared to take on the prisoners until they build more prisons and train guards. HRW also urged the US to ensure that the eventual transfers comply with the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] and that those who remain in US custody be guaranteed treatment that complies with the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text]. The <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/world/middleeast/25detain.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">more</a>.<br /><br />The proposed security agreement, along with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html#2">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [CFA Materials, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">report</a>], would extend US forces&#39; involvement in Iraq until 2011. Strong political opposition to the proposed agreement has caused both sides to consider asking the the UN for an extension of its current <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">mandate</a> [UN press release], which authorizes US troops to remain in Iraq only until the end of the year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Indonesian court on Wednesday sentenced former <a href="http://www.bi.go.id/web/en">Bank Indonesia</a> (BI) [official website] chief Burhanuddin Abdullah to five years in prison on corruption charges for knowingly approving the misappropriation of $10 million of the central bank&#39;s funds. Governor of BI from May 2003 until May 2008, Abdullah was arrested in April following an investigation by Indonesia&#39;s <a href="http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/news/">Corruption Eradication Commission</a> (KPK) [official website, in Bahasa] into allegations that he approved the use of BI funds to bribe members of the legislature and to pay legal fees to defend other bank officials accused of corruption. Abdullah, who was also fined $23,250, denies the charges and said he will appeal the decision. The KPK also <a href="http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2955">announced</a> [KPK press release, in Bahasa] Wednesday that four more suspects are being investigated in connection with the case, including <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/10/29/anticorruption-watchdog-officially-names-aulia-pohan-a-suspect.html">Aulia Pohan</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Jakarta Post</font> report], a former BI senior deputy governor and relative by marriage of <a href="http://www.presidensby.info/index.php/eng/index.html">President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3725301.stm">profile</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Australian state court Wednesday sentenced suspected terrorist <a href="http://www.justice4jack.com/">Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; Thomas</a> [advocacy website] to nine months in prison for possessing a falsified passport. <a href="http://www.vicbar.com.au/webdata/VicBarNewsFiles/Welcomes%20-%202.pdf">Justice Elizabeth Curtain</a> [official profile, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/Supreme+Court/Home/">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> [official website] released Thomas in consideration for his time served in prison, the prolonged delay in his prosecution, and his lack of prior convictions. Thomas, known in the Australian media as &quot;Jihad Jack&quot;, was convicted last week of possessing a falsified passport, but was found not guilty of receiving money and a plane ticket from an al Qaeda operative. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ghvy7znCIa51b9mCoiER7udqetWQD943VT8G0">more</a>.<br /><br />The sentencing signals the end of a long legal challenge. Thomas was originally <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/australian-to-appeal-conviction-for.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in February 2006 of receiving $3,500 and a plane ticket after training with al Qaeda in Afghanistan, making him the first person incarcerated under the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/E3050AC88CDFDC74CA256F7100561D7B/$file/0662002.pdf">Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2002</a> [text, PDF] and the first person to be subject to Australia&#39;s controversial <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=australia+control+order">control orders</a> [JURIST archive]. That conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/australia-appeals-court-overturns.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Victoria&#39;s appeals division after it was shown Thomas was interrogated by Australian Federal Police officers in Pakistan under duress and without access to a lawyer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">Russian State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], the country&#39;s lower house of parliament, on Wednesday unanimously approved <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/russia-signs-defense-agreements-with.php">military defense agreements</a> [JURIST report] signed with Georgia&#39;s breakaway regions of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">South Ossetia and Abkhazia</a> [JURIST news archive] last month. The so-called Treaties on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance allow Russia to offer military assistance and provide for the 3,800 Russian troops to be deployed to each region. After the signing, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/09/17/1948_type82912type82914type82915_206565.shtml">defended</a> [statement text] the use of Russian troops in the regions to help &quot;remove threats to peace&quot; as proper under <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter7.htm">Article 51 of the United Nations Charter</a> [text]. The treaties also establish joint cooperation on issues including citizenship and border control, criminal investigations, humanitarian aid, and <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081029/118011845.html">infrastructure</a> [RIA Novosti report]. The agreements now must be approved by the <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/">Federation Council of Russia</a> [official website, in Russian], the country&#39;s upper house. If approved, the treaties will last for ten years, with automatic renewal if no objections are submitted. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hMwNwByhP9L89m6jkmQOXgM6etqQD9443VAO0">more</a>. From Russia, <em>Kommersant</em> has <a href="http://www.kommersant.com/p-13466/r_527/Treaty_South_Ossetia_Abkhazia/">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The treaties have received heavy international criticism and have made Russia one of only two countries in the world to recognize the regions&#39; independence, along with Nicaragua. Georgia&#39;s <a href="http://www.nsc.gov.ge/index1.php">National Security Council</a> [official website] secretary Alexander Lomaia decried the agreements, saying that they were effectively an illegal attempt to annex the regions. The US and the European Union have also criticized the deal, and spokespersons for NATO previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-recognition-of-georgia.php">denounced Russia&#39;s decision to recognize the teritories</a> [JURIST report] as violative of international law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US military judge <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ralph+kohlmann">Col. Ralph Kohlmann</a> [JURIST news archive] ruled Monday that defense attorney Cmdr. Suzanne Lachelier could gain access to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/102770.html">Camp 7</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> backgrounder], a special camp for alleged al Qaeda members classified as &quot;high-value detainees&quot; at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison.   Lachelier is the defense lawyer for Ramzi Binalshibh, who has been <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2008/d20080211chargesheet.pdf">charged</a> [text, PDF] with murder and war crimes for his alleged role in the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive].  She told the military court that she wants to know if Camp 7 conditions are contributing to Binalshibh&#39;s mental illnesses, including psychosis and schizophrenia, which could lead to a conclusion that he is incompetent to stand trial.  Kohlmann on Monday denied requests that a defense psychologist also be allowed into the camp.  Binalshibh, classified as an enemy combatant for his role in the attacks, faces the death penalty if convicted.  AP has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27423519/">more</a>.<br /><br />Prisoners in Camp 7 are isolated from other prisoners to prevent violence against those who have provided information to interrogators, and the exact location of the camp has been kept secret to prevent a terrorist attack.  The existence of the camp was not known until last December when it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09gitmo.html?ex=1354942800&en=72ea45200785b9bc&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">mentioned</a> [NYT report] in <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/terror-suspect-subjected-to-state.php">court papers</a> [JURIST report] filed by lawyers for <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/majid_khan.htm">Majid Khan</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], the first &quot;high-value&quot; Guantanamo Bay detainee to be allowed to meet privately with legal counsel.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a landmark intellectual property decision Thursday, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1130.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 9-3 that a business concept for hedging risk in the field of commodities trading was too vague for patent protection. The case on an application by Bernard Bilski, the CEO of a company called Weatherwise, could affect the validity of thousands of patents, particularly in the financial services and software industries. Relying on the &quot;machine-or-transformation test&quot; established in the 1972 Supreme Court case <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/cases/175PQ673.htm">Gottschalk v. Benson</a> [text] and reaffirmed in the 1981 case <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/cases/209PQ1.htm">Diamond v. Diehr</a> [text], the court ruled that business methods do not meet the standard for patentability under US law. The majority concluded that Bilski&#39;s patent application did not meet the definition of &quot;process&quot; under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_101.htm">35 U.S.C. 101</a> [text] because it did not involve a machine and did not physically transform anything. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin -->The <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/business/31patent.html?ref=business">more</a>.<!-- odiogo-notts-end --><br /><br />Bilski and Rand Warsaw filed their patent application on April 10, 1997. After its rejection on the grounds that an abstract idea is not patentable, they appealed to the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/go/dcom/bpai/index.html">Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences</a> [official website] which sustained all eleven objections on their patent application. The appeal was <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2007-1130-1.mp3">originally argued</a> [argument, audio] before a panel of the court in October 2007. The court <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1130%20order.pdf">ordered en banc review</a> [order, PDF], and <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2007-1130-2.mp3">oral argument</a> [part 1, recorded audio; <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2007-1130-3.mp3">part 2</a>] was held last May. The Circuit Court&#39;s decision could have wide-ranging consequences across a number of industries, as many currently accused of patent infringement are likely to argue that in light of Thursday&#39;s ruling many older patents are invalid. It is not yet clear if Bilski will appeal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A jury for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on Thursday found Charles McArthur Emmanuel, son of former Liberian President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Charles+Taylor%22">Charles Taylor</a> [JURIST news archive], guilty of <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/us-grand-jury-indicts-son-of-former.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] that he was involved in torture and other crimes in Liberia between 1999 and 2002. Emmanuel, a US citizen raised in Boston, had <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/son-of-ex-liberian-president-taylor.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges and was the first person indicted under a 1994 <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113C.html">federal anti-torture statute</a> [18 USC 2340A text]. Both <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/30/usdom20108.htm">rights groups</a> [HRW release] and US prosecutors applauded the conviction, and in a Department of Justice <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/October/08-crm-971.html">press release</a> [text] US Attorney General <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Michael+Mukasey">Michael Mukasey</a> [JURIST news archive] said:<blockquote>Today&#8217;s conviction provides a measure of justice to those who were victimized by the reprehensible acts of Charles Taylor Jr. and his associates... It sends a powerful message to human rights violators around the world that, when we can, we will hold them fully accountable for their crimes.</blockquote>Emmanuel was found guilty of all eight charges included in his 2006 <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2006/December/06_crm_813.html">indictment</a> [DOJ press release], including five counts of torture, one count of using a firearm to commit a violent crime, and two related conspiracy charges. His sentencing is set for January 9, 2009 and he faces as much as life in prison. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --> AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iiO6CulQk7vidXyfRnbc22_vyyJQ">more</a>.<!-- odiogo-notts-end --> <br /><br />In July, US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-upholds-torture-charges.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the torture charges, rejecting Emmanuel&#39;s argument that the federal statute under which he was charged exceeded Congressional authority because it criminalizes behavior of foreign government officials outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Last December, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-judge-denies-bail-for-son-of.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] for Emmanuel, ruling that he was a flight risk and a danger to the community.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/presidency/president.html">Judge Phillippe Kirsch</a> [official profile] told the UN General Assembly Thursday that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/presidency/PK_20081030_ENG.pdf">ICC is at a &quot;critical stage&quot;</a> [transcript, PDF] ten years after its creation. Presenting his <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/presidency/ICC-A-63-323-En.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/439.html">press release</a>; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28778&Cr=icc&Cr1=icj">press release</a>], Kirsch said that while serious war crimes and crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the court continue to be committed worldwide, it is &quot;still far too early to pass judgment&quot; on the court&#39;s success. He added: <blockquote>Most fundamentally, the success of the Court will depend on it fulfilling properly its own mandate. The Court must and will continue to do its part to ensure its judicial independence and impartiality. It will investigate and prosecute crimes within its jurisdiction in accordance with the principle of complementarity. It will guarantee the rights of the accused and of suspects. It will interpret the Rome Statute and develop a body of jurisprudence. It will protect victims and witnesses. It will give further effect to the rights of victims to participate. It will address questions of reparations to victims. And in all its proceedings, it will continue to strive for the highest standards of efficiency and transparency.<br /><br />However, it is important to bear in mind at all times that the ICC &#8211; and the ICC system with its checks and balances and its limitations on the power of the Court &#8211; was created by States as a judicial mechanism to assist in the achievement of certain objectives mentioned in the preamble of the Rome Statute. The system can only work effectively if all actors in the system play their part.</blockquote>Last week, the ICC Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/icc-keeps-congo-ex-militia-leader.php">decided not to release</a> [JURIST report] former Congolese militia leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6131516.stm">Thomas Lubanga</a> [BBC profiler; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=lubanga">news archive</a>] but <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1486-ENG.pdf">dismissed a request</a> [judgment, PDF] that it lift an indefinite stay on his trial. Lubanga, once the leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/upc.htm">Union of Patriotic Congolese</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is charged with using child soldiers in his militia and <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/congo-militia-leader-makes-first.php">became the first war crimes defendant</a> to appear before the ICC after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST reports] in 2006. Earlier this month, ICC judges <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-02-05-160-ENG.pdf">requested</a> [court order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/icc-judges-seek-more-information-before.php">report</a>] more information on an arrest warrant application for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>], who faces charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities allegedly committed in the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICC instructed <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] to submit &#8220;additional supporting materials in relation to some confidential aspects&#8221; of his application no later than November 17, 2008.

US military and civilian prosecutors filed the motion in September, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-seeking-extended-sentence-for.php">arguing</a> [JURIST report] that the Guantanamo military commission which heard his case improperly gave him credit for time spent in custody. Hamdan was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-sentence-could-mean-fewer-than.php">sentenced</a> to five and a half years in prison in August, following his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] on providing <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2007/Hamdan_Charges.pdf">material support for terrorism</a> [charge sheet, PDF]. The trial judge, Navy Capt. Keith Allred, gave Hamdan credit for 61 months served, which he calculated at a different standard than that of a ordinary enemy combatant. While Hamden will be eligible for release in January, the US government has said that once his sentence is up, it can detain him indefinitely as an enemy combatant. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin -->AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gglrR7Vtd6ok0BFD4uVb3B9-ZYpQD945538G0">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official site] on Thursday upheld a Missouri state <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/08info/pdf-bill/tat/SB714.pdf">law</a> [SB 714 s. 589.426 text, PDF] designed to prevent registered sex offenders from participating in Halloween activities. The law requires sex offenders to post a sign reading &quot;No candy or treats at this residence,&quot; turn off porch lights, avoid Halloween-related activity with children, and remain in their homes on Halloween between 5:00 PM to 10:30 PM unless there is just cause to leave. The decision overturns a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/missouri-law-limiting-halloween.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official site] on Monday that found that two provisions of the law were too restrictive and could not be enforced. <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/index.htm">Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt</a> [official website] praised the Thursday&#8217;s decision in a <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/cgi-bin/coranto/viewnews.cgi?id=EkkVupuZpuJEzchUxl&style=Default+News+Style&tmpl=newsitem">statement</a> [press release]: <blockquote>As Missouri&#39;s governor I have signed tough legislation to increase the penalties for sexual predators, particularly those who commit crimes against our children. I am pleased that the court ruled that our new provisions to protect Missouri&#8217;s children from sexual predators on Halloween can be enforced.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/us/31brfs-JUDGESUPHOLD_BRF.html?_r=1&scp=5&sq=judge+court&st=nyt&oref=slogin">more</a>.<br /><br />The federal court&#8217;s decision breaks a judicial trend towards overturning sex offender laws found to be too restrictive. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/georgia-high-court-declares-sex.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-jersey-court-strikes-down-sex.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indiana-appeals-court-partially.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] are among the states that have recently overturned laws.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK Home Secretary <a href="http://www.jacquismithmp.co.uk/">Jacqui Smith</a> has asked Attorney General <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/sub_about_us_biographies.htm">Baroness Scotland</a> [official websites] to begin a criminal investigation into claims that both British and US officers contributed to the torture of Guantanamo Bay detainee and former UK resident <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [Reprieve profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">news archive</a>], according to a <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/British_Government_refers_Binyam_Mohameds_case_to_Attorney_General.htm">government letter</a> [Reprieve release] released Thursday. Smith also provided Scotland with evidence relating to Mohamed&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/detainee-alleges-abuse-en-route-to.php">claims</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">CIA</a> and <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official websites] agents involved in his detention and rendition to Morocco were complicit in the abuse he allegedly suffered while being interrogated there. The High Court in London <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/21/mohamed_full210808.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-high-court-rules-foreign-office-must.php">report</a>] in August that the evidence should be released because it was &quot;essential&quot; to Mohamed&#39;s defense that information against him was obtained through torture, but Foreign Secretary David Miliband later <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/uk-court-gives-government-another-week.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] the court&#39;s order. Rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/index.html">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] praised Smith&#39;s release of the evidence, and called on Scotland to bring criminal charges against those responsible for Mohamed&#39;s alleged abuse. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin --> The <font style="font-style: italic;">Independent</font> has <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/cia-officers-could-face-trial-in-britain-over-torture-allegations-980384.html">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Guardian</font> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/oct/30/uksecurity-terrorism">additional coverage</a>.<!-- odiogo-notts-end --> <br /><br />Also Thursday, <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to provide Mohamed&#39;s lawyers with whatever evidence it had regarding his alleged abuse. US prosecutors earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed without prejudice</a> charges they had brought against Mohamed <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/british-resident-at-guantanamo-charged.php">claiming</a> that he was involved in a plan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dod-to-charge-uk-resident-held-at.php">detonate a dirty bomb</a> [JURIST reports], but said that they are considering whether or not to recharge him with other crimes. Sullivan, who is overseeing a lawsuit Mohammed has brought against the government, said the move was suspicious and questioned the validity of the evidence against him. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin -->The <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/us/31gitmo.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin">more</a>.<!-- odiogo-notts-end --> <br /><br />Mohamed asserts that after he was arrested in Pakistan, he was turned over to US officials who then transferred him to Moroccan agents who tortured him; he was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, in a <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">letter</a> [DOC, text] sent by his lawyer to Miliband, he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">asked the UK government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved. For most of 2007, Binyam was one of five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+residents+guantanamo">UK residents detained at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Three of those were <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11576">released</a> [DOD press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-residents-released-from-guantanamo.php">report</a>] from US custody in December. The official status of a fourth detainee remains unclear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia&#39;s <a href="http://fas.gov.ru/english/">Federal Antimonopoly Service</a> (FAS) [official website] Thursday announced that Russian oil companies <a href="http://www.rosneft.com/">Rosneft</a> and <a href="http://www.lukoil.com/">LUKoil</a> [corporate websites] broke competition laws in the Russian market by fixing monopoly-like prices this summer. The FAS found Rosneft and LUKoil fixed high prices for gasoline, diesel fuel, air fuel, and fuel oil. The agency will determine the size of fines within the next two weeks. <!-- odiogo-notts-begin -->Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssEnergyNews/idUSLU16468320081030?feedType=RSS&feedName=rbssEnergyNews&rpc=22">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081030/118046055.html">local coverage</a>.<!-- odiogo-notts-end --> <br /><br />In July, the FAS <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/english/news/n_19735.shtml">sent inquiries</a> [FAS press release] to major Russian oil producers LUKoil, <a href="http://www.gazprom-neft.com/">Gazprom Neft</a>, <a href="http://www.surgutneftegas.ru/eng/index.xpml">Surgutneftegaz</a>, <a href="http://www.tnk-bp.com/">TNK-BP</a> [corporate websites], and Rosneft over rising fuel prices. Earlier this month the agency <a href="http://en.rian.ru/business/20081016/117786037.html">demanded</a> [RIA Novosti report] that they all cut prices. In September, Gazprom Neft and TNK-BP were also found in breach of competition laws. The Russian oil industry has been somewhat in disarray since the collapse of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yukos">Yukos Oil</a> [JURIST news archive], which legally ceased to exist in 2007 after the Moscow Arbitration Court completed its liquidation. Once Russia&#39;s largest oil company, Yukos was forced to <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/russia-arbitration-judge-declares.php">declare bankruptcy</a> [JURIST report] in August 2006 when it could not pay claimed back taxes. Former Yukos CEO <a href="http://www.mbktrial.com/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] was convicted of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-seven.php">tax evasion</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 and is currently imprisoned in Siberia. Rosneft acquired Yukos&#39; remaining assets.
