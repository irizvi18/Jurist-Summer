		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.senado.gov.py/">Paraguay's Senate</a> [official website] on Friday approved a constitutional amendment lifting Paraguay's one-term rule for presidents. Put in place by Paraguay's <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Paraguay_2011.pdf">1992 Constitution</a> [text] following long-term dictatorship, the current rules limit the president to one five-year term. Current president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Horacio-Cartes">Horacio Cartes</a> [Britannica profile] is seeking to lift the one five-year term limit, a measure supported in the Senate by 25 of 45 legislators. The vote will now go to the <a href="http://www.diputados.gov.py/ww1/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website], where 44 of the 80 members belong to the president's <a href="http://www.anr.org.py/">Colorado Party</a> [official website]. If approved there, the vote will go to a national referendum. In the interim, protests have erupted outside Congress, with at least one protestor reported killed and the Congressional building burned. </p>

<p>Opponents of the term-limit lift assert that to do so is unconstitutional, including Senate President Roberto Acevedo of the opposition Authentic Radical Liberal Party, who <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-paraguay-senate-presidential-reelection-20170331-story.html">argued</a> [LA Times report] that the means used to bring the amendment to a vote violated Senate rules. Paraguay's term-limit vote largely mirrors other corruption issues worldwide. The same day, the recently-impeached South Korea President Guen-Hye Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-south-korea-president-arrested.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking government secrets. Park may be facing an additional nine other charges and can be held behind bars for up to 20 days during the course of the investigation. Earlier that week Attorney General Edgar Veytia of the state of Nayarit, Mexico, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mexico-state-ag-arrested-in-san-diego-for-drug-charges.php">was arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of international narcotics trafficking conspiracy. Earlier in the month Argentinian Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/argentinas-ex-president-ordered-to-stand-trial.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] former President Cristina Kirchner to stand trail in a multi-billion dollar fraud case. Kirchner and 14 other government officials have been accused of collaborating in an attempt to to defraud the Argentinian government of $3.5 billion by selling the Central Bank of Argentina's dollar futures at below-market rates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile] on Friday released an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/31/presidential-executive-order-establishing-enhanced-collection-and">executive order</a> [text] instructing the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/">Commerce Department</a> and the <a href="https://ustr.gov/">US Trade Representative</a> [official websites] to study causes of the US trade deficit in advance of Chinese President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11551399">Xi Jinping</a>'s [BBC profile] visit next week. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/31/remarks-president-trump-et-al-signing-trade-executive-orders">urged</a> [remarks], "[w]e're going to investigate all trade abuses, and, based on those findings, we will take necessary and lawful action to end those many abuses." The order will review those nations with a trade surplus with the US, including China, with a $347 billion surplus last year, followed by Japan ($69 billion surplus), Germany ($65 billion), Mexico ($63 billion), Ireland ($36 billion) and Vietnam ($32 billion). This order appears to be a part of Trump's campaign promises to bring manufacturing back to the US, an interest that returns to the top of his to-do list following the Trump administrations <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-healthcare-bill-withdrawn-from-congress-due-to-lack-of-votes.php">failure to replace</a> [JURIST report] Obamacare last week. </p>

<p>Trump's administration has been fraught with controversy in its infancy. Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate held its <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-holds-first-hearing-on-russia-involvement-in-election.php">first hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Russian involvement in the 2016 election. Last week the FBI director <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Also this week, former US Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-nsc-advisor-michael-flynn-requests-immunity-in-exchange-for-testimony.php">requested immunity</a> [JURIST report] in exchange for his potential testimony on Russian interference in the election, according to a letter from his attorney, Robert Kelner. A few days before a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the state of Hawaii's request to convert the temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking Trump's travel ban, granted earlier this month, into a preliminary injunction. The TRO in question blocked Trump's second travel ban, his first having been <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-denies-rehearing-of-trumps-original-immigration-order.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] by federal courts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56470#.WOA0jvkrI2x">expressed his discontent</a> [UN news centre] with Israel's <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/israel-approves-first-new-west-bank-settlement-in-20-years.php">latest decision</a> [JURIST report] to build settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and repeated his previous calls for a two-state solution to resolve the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In particular, a spokesman for Guterres said the UN official "condemns all unilateral actions that, like the present one, threaten peace and undermine the two-state solution." This condemnation follows in line with recent international ire for Israel's actions in building settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. A recent proposal to resolve the issue noted the Israeli settlements are at odds with international law and are generally in conflict with lasting peace in the region.</p>

<p>While Israel and Palestine have a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">troubled past</a> [HRW backgrounder], the issue of settlements in the West Bank have escalated tensions in the last decade. In November Israel's Ministerial Committee for Legislation <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/israel-legislative-committee-approves-bill-legalizing-west-bank-outposts.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] the Formalization Bill to legalize the West Bank outposts. In March 2016 the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-office-concerned-about-extra-judicial-execution-in-west-bank.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the office is concerned about the apparent extra-judicial execution of a Palestinian man in the West Bank. In January of that same year Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-urges-businesses-to-cease-operations-in-israel-settlements.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] businesses to cease operations in Israel settlements. In August 2015 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/08/un-officials-denounce-west-bank-arson-attack-that-killed-palestinian-child.php">both sides of the conflict</a> [JURIST report] to reconcile and move towards peace after an attack occurred in the West Bank village of Duma, where Jewish extremists allegedly set fire to a Palestinian home while a family slept inside. Last April HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/04/13/ripe-abuse/palestinian-child-labor-israeli-agricultural-settlements-west-bank">alleged</a> [HRW report] that Israeli settlement farmers in the occupied West Bank are using Palestinian child laborers in dangerous conditions in violation of international laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legislation which would have prohibited "sanctuary cities" in the state and banned abortions where a heartbeat is detectable failed to meet the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/iowa/articles/2017-03-31/sanctuary-cities-ban-among-bills-dead-at-iowa-legislature">necessary procedural deadline</a> [U.S.News report] in the <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/">Iowa Legislature</a> [official website] Friday. First, the sanctuary city legislation would have required counties, cities, and public colleges to enforce federal immigration law. Despite the legislation, no current Iowa cities identify as sanctuary cities. Second, the abortion legislation would have required several things, including banning all abortions where a heartbeat could be detected, requiring 72-hour wait period for receiving an abortion, and creating further legal action against doctors in violation of the law. Despite this second bill not receiving enough support, Iowa Republicans are currently focused on new legislation which would ban almost all abortions around 20-weeks of pregnancy.</p>

<p>Abortion restrictions remain a much contested issue in the US. In March the Texas Senate approved bills this week that would <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/texas-senate-passes-two-anti-abortion-bills.php">prevent</a> [JURIST report] doctors from encouraging abortions to avoid lawsuits from birth defects and to require doctors to ensure a fetus is deceased before performing certain procedures. In February the Pennsylvania Senate <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would ban abortions past 20 weeks. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a bill into law in January <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/01/arkansas-governor-signs-law-banning-second-trimester-abortion-procedure.php">banning the dilation and evacuation abortion method</a> [JURIST report]. In October a federal judge blocked a Mississippi law that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/10/federal-court-blocks-mississippi-law-disqualifying-medicaid-benefits-for-healthcare-providers-provid.php">disqualified</a> [JURIST report] Medicaid benefits for non-therapeutic abortions. Also in October the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/10/oklahoma-top-court-strikes-down-law-restricting-abortion-access.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law adding new licensing and inspection rules for facilities that perform abortions is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Egypt Court of Urgent Matters on Sunday struck down a ruling by the Egypt High Administrative Court regarding the transfer of two uninhabited Red Sea islands from Egypt to Saudi Arabia. The Egyptian government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-saudi-islands-idUSKBN1740CJ">transferred the two islands</a> [reuters report], Tiran and Sanafir, to Saudi Arabia in April 2016, based on the belief that they had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. Sunday's decision will let the transfer move forward, but the decision is still subject to appeal and parliamentary approval. The decision is controversial, as critics hold that the Court of Urgent Matters is a lower court and <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egyptian-court-rules-favour-red-sea-islands-transfer-saudi-1797293386">does not have jurisdiction</a> [news report] to overrule decisions made by the High Administrative Court. The Court of Urgent Matters is seen by some as a tool the Egyptian parliament is using to either stall or push the deal through, despite the deal being struck down the High Administrative Court. The transfer of the islands has also been controversial, as critics have accused the Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi of giving the islands to Saudi Arabia in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39471671">exchange for financial support</a> [BBC report] for al-Sisi and the current Egyptian government. </p>

<p>The relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt has been getting closer since President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi took power in Egypt. In 2015 Egypt and Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-saudi-arabia-sign-joint-security-agreement.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to improve stability and safety in the region. A year later, in 2016, the agreement to transfer the two islands in question was made between the two countries. In June 2016 the transfer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-court-invalidates-transfer-of-islands-to-saudi-arabia.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] by a lower court in Cairo. In January 2017 the High Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/egypt-court-halts-transfer-of-red-sea-islands-to-saudi-arabia.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the lower court's decision, thereby halting the transfer of the islands to Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Tackling%20discrimination.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF] on discrimination and how it is handled in British prisons was published on Sunday, showing that only 1 out of 100 complaints of discrimination by prison guards are won by the prisoner. The report, which was written by the two rights organizations <a href="http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/">Prison Reform Trust</a> [website] and <a href="http://www.thezmt.org/">Zahid Mubarak Trust</a> [website], concludes that the system for handling complaints for discrimination is neither fair nor impartial, and does not have the confidence of prisoners. As opposed to the 1% success rate in cases accusing guards of discrimination, prison staff was successful in 76% percent of cases when accusing a prisoner of discrimination. The report attributes the lack of focus on avoiding discrimination to fewer officers in the prison and increasing violence. The report also finds that the burden of proof is too high on the prisoner, resulting in cases often being dismissed even though the prisoner did present some evidence of discrimination. The report is the first study of British prisons since the use of the discrimination incident reporting form (DIRF) started five years ago. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/01/prison-racial-religious-discrimination-complaints-report">DIRF method was instituted</a> [Guardian report] after a report criticized the system following the death of Zahid Mubarek, who was killed by his racist cellmate. </p>

<p>The treatment of prisoners has been widely criticized around the world. In March a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/report-thailand-prisons-failing-to-meet-international-standards.php">report</a> [JURIST report] detailed how prisons in Thailand did not live up to international standards. In January a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/record-number-of-prison-deaths-in-england-and-wales-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in England and Wales showed that overcrowding and a cut in funding and staffing had led to a record number of prison deaths in 2016. In September 2012 a <a href="/hotline/2012/09/katherine-todrys-invisible-prisoners.php">report</a> [JURIST commentary] criticized the treatment of prisoners in Malawi and other African countries, claiming that many prisoners had been in prison for years without being in front of a judge. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> [official website] officials said Afghan repatriation is set to continue on Monday with <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/cuts-cash-incentive-afghan-refugees-pakistan-170402061355610.html">reduced cash incentives</a> [Aljazeera report] for Afghan refugees to leave Pakistan. The cash incentive, which was initially $400, was cut in half to $200 in order to facilitate voluntary Afghan repatriation. Despite these cuts many refugees are continuing to register for repatriation. The current efforts to deport Afghan refugees is an effort that, according to the Pakistani government, is designed for national security. According to various human rights organizations, the number of police abuses and extortion efforts against Afghan refugees has increased following this initiative. Currently, Pakistan is home to approximately 1.3 million registered Afghan refugees and 1 million unregistered Afghan refugees.</p>

<p>The rights of refugee and migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. In January the Slovenian parliament passed amendments to the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-slovenia-strips-refugees-of-protections.php">Aliens Act</a> [JURIST report] to enact emergency measures to deny refugees entry into the country and to expel those whom did not have their asylum claims properly assessed. Also in January US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/17-state-ags-denounce-trump-immigration-order.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an executive order restricting access to the US for refugees and visa holders from seven countries. The order also indefinitely suspends the entry into the US of Syrian refugees. The order further suspended admission of refugees from any country for 120 days while the administration is reviewing the visa program and limited the number of possible refugees for 2017 to 50,000. In November experts questioned humanitarian conditions at Grecian migrant camps when a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/2-asylum-seekers-killed-in-fire-at-greece-migrant-camp.php">66-year-old woman and six-year-old boy died</a> [JURIST report] in a camp fire. In April 2016 several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also in April 2016 Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the first deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was "riddled with an array of irregularities." In March 2016 former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments. That same month, an independent UN human rights expert encouraged EU leaders to remain <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">steadfast</a> [JURIST report] in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday a federal judge <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/343736839/Memorandum-Opinion-and-Order#download&from_embed">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] President Donald Trump's [official website] free speech defense in response to his alleged inciting of violence among protesters during his presidential campaign. The current lawsuit against Trump alleges the then-presidential candidate attempted to incite violence among his supporters by saying "get 'em out of here" in response to protesters at his Kentucky rally. At the rally two women and a man were supposedly shoved and punched by several members in attendance at the rally following his statements. The judge specifically held that there was sufficient evidentiary support that the injuries were a "direct and proximate result" of Trump's comments. Two people who allegedly forced the three protesters out were also named in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's election campaign faced serious concerns over eliciting violence against those opposed to his cause. In November state democrats <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/11/voter-intimidation-injunction-pennsylvania-230901">raised voter intimidation suits in six states</a> [Politico report], yet only a federal judge in Ohio granted the requested injunction before being <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-appeals-court-stays-order-blocking-voter-intimidation-ativities-in-ohio.php">rejected on appeal</a>[JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judge William R. Marchant of the <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/richmond/home.html">13th Judicial Circuit Court of Virginia</a> [official website] in Richmond <a href="/paperchase/3-31-17%20Vesilind%20Opinion%20and%20Order.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the state on Friday in a lawsuit challenging the redistricting of 11 legislative districts. <a href="http://www.onevirginia2021.org/">OneVirginia2021</a>[advocate website], a non-profit organization that advocates for "fair redistricting" in the state, brought the suit accusing Republican legislators of gerrymandering when drawing the districts during the 2011 Virginia General Assembly. Virginia House Speaker <a href="http://www.williamjhowell.org/news/">Bill Howell</a> [official website] praised the court's decision, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/circuit-judge-tosses-virginia-gerrymandering-case-says-districts-debatable/2017/03/31/21b6fc40-1646-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term=.965961fd8974">saying</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] "Virginia has a fair and open redistricting process that involves multiple hearings and extensive input from the public." <a href="http://durrettecrump.com/attorney-profiles/durrette-wyatt-b-jr/">Wyatt B Durrette</a> [professional profile], the attorney for OneVirginia2021, has indicated they will appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Voting rights continue to be a pressing issue. Last month seven convicted felons on filed <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-ex-felons-file-class-action-suit-over-voting-rights-laws.php">suit alleging</a> [JURIST report] Florida's process of restoring voting rights to felons is unconstitutionally arbitrary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A local <a href="https://www.justiz.bayern.de/gericht/lg/m1/">Munich Court</a> [official website, in German] denied Friday a motion by <a href="http://www-origin.vw.com">Volkswagen</a> (VW) [official website] to bar evidence seized during searches of a law firm working for the company. Volkswagen filed its complaint last week in an attempt to prevent German prosecutors from analyzing material confiscated during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-investigation-germany.html">March 15 raid</a> [<em>NYT</em> report ] on <a href="http://www.jonesday.com">Jones Day</a> [corporate website], the law firm conducting an internal investigation for VW into emissions test cheating at the company. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-court-idUSKBN1750RF">concluded</a> [Reuters report] that the raids were lawful and the evidence would thus be available to prosecutors. The court's decision will now be reviewed by the Munich District Court. </p>

<p>The VW scandal began in September 2015 when it was leaked that VW had intentionally circumvented emissions tests through installing technology to determine when emissions testing would take place and alter the cars emissions during inspections. It was found that the practice took place for at least six years. In February VW <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">agreed to plead guilty and pay billions of dollars</a> [JURIST report] to correct their 3.0 liter diesel engine vehicles. VW <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-for-diesel-emissions-scandal.php">pled guilty</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month per the agreement. In December the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/EU-to-take-action-against-7-member-states-over-VW-emissions-scandal.php">EU decided to take action </a>[JURIST report] against seven member states over the emissions scandal. A US judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-approves-volkswagen-settlement-in-emissions-scandal.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $14.7 billion settlement in October between VW and the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the state of California and car owners who filed a class action lawsuit over the company's emissions scandal. In September the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] VW and its local subsidiary for misleading customers. In July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US Environmental Protection Agency, California officials and consumers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/SRIPeoplesIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/VictoriaTauliCorpuz.aspx">Victoria Tauli-Corpuz</a> [official profile], said Monday she was <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21473&LangID=E">appalled</a> [press release] by the living conditions of Aboriginal Australians following her week-long visit to Australia. According to the report, many Aboriginal people live in "town camps" without access to basic sanitation. Tauli-Corpuz said: <blockquote>As I have travelled across the country, I have found the prevalence of racism against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples deeply disturbing. This manifests itself in different ways, ranging from public stereotyped portrayals of them as violent criminals, welfare profiteers and poor parents and to discrimination in the administration of justice.</blockquote> She was particularly concerned with the number of Aboriginal children imprisoned for petty crimes. Tali-Corpuz stated that while Aboriginal people make up 3 percent of the Australian population, they account for 27 percent of the prison population and 95 percent of the juvenile prison population. "The focus urgently needs to move away from detention and punishment towards rehabilitation," she said.  </p>

<p>Australia's treatment of Aboriginal people has drawn criticism from the international community.  Last month, another UN rapporteur said that Australia's policies to prevent violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">do not benefit</a> [JURIST report] Aboriginal women. In December the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-australians-to-end-all-forms-of-racial-discrimination.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Australia to end all forms of racial discrimination, including against indigenous Australians. Last July Amnesty International said Australia must <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-australia-must-address-abuse-of-child-prisoners.php">address</a> [JURIST report] abuse of child prisoners.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bh/AboutBahrain/Goverment/HMtheKing/tabid/137/language/en-US/Default.aspx">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain</a> [official profile] ratified a constitutional amendment Monday that would allow for military trials of civilians suspected of terrorism in the country. The <a href="http://www.adhrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Explanatory-Note-to-Martial-Courts-Constitutional-Amendment.pdf">amendment</a> [explanatory note, PDF] modifies the text of <a href="http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/mideast/BH/bahrain-constitution-of-february-14-in-english/at_download/file">Article 105(b) of the Kingdom of Bahrain's Constitution</a> [text, PDF] to read: <blockquote>The Law governs the military judiciary and defines its jurisdictions for Bahrain Defense Force, the National Guard and the Public Security Forces.</blockquote> The Bahraini government says the amendment is necessary in light of the spreading of terrorism in the area. They further argue that the amendment will secure the nations "independence, sovereignty, and security" by expediting legal investigations and convictions. Rights group Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/bahrain-disastrous-move-towards-patently-unfair-military-trials-of-civilians/">criticized the move</a> [press release], saying the law was vaguely worded and could be abused.</p>

<p>Bahrain's human rights record has been closely scrutinized in recent months. In September <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/bahrains-human-rights-record-criticized-by-32-countries.php">32 nations joined</a> [JURIST report] a statement to the UN urging Bahrain to protect freedom of peaceful assembly and speech, and to investigate reports of torture used on prisoners. In April a human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-bahrain-government-reforms-have-failed-to-end-rights-violations.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Bahrain's post-2011 reforms had failed to put a stop to human rights violations including illegal detentions and torture. And last February the Bahrain Ministry of the Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">started</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation against a political opposition group for allegedly illegal content posted on social media. The Bahraini parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the amendment in March.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Advocacy group <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] on Sunday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/02/sisi-trump-meeting-shows-mutual-contempt-rights">criticized</a> [press release] US President Donald Trump's plan to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, saying the move effectively endorses the country's poor recent human rights record. Al-Sisi overthrew the democratically elected Mohamed Morsay in July 2013 and oversaw opposition protests that left 1150 people dead. The group says that Under al-Sisi's presidency, tens of thousands of Egyptians have been arrested and security forces have committed human rights abuses including torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. According to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-margon">Sarah Margon</a> [professional profile], Washington director at Human Rights Watch, "inviting al-Sisi for an official visit to Washington as tens of thousands of Egyptians rot in jail and when torture is again the order of the day is a strange way to build a stable strategic relationship."</p>

<p>Egypt has been under the international spotlight lately for its human rights abuses, particularly, it's treatment of journalists. In February, <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-sg-welcomes-egypt-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the decision by Egyptian authorities to release on bail two Al Jazeera journalists awaiting retrial on terror charges. The men were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egyptian-authorities-detain-al-jazeera-journalists.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2013 along with fellow Al Jazeera journalist and Australian national Peter Greste. In March Greste was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/jurist-political-conflict-in-egypt.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from the Cairo detention facility and deported, under a law allowing the deportation of foreign nationals to their home countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anti-terrorism laws that were passed by Senegal's <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.sn/">National Assembly</a> [official website] in October, are "draconian" and could "restrict freedom of expression and roll back the rule of law in Senegal," according to a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AFR4960062017ENGLISH.PDF">report</a> [text, PDF] released Monday by <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI)  [advocacy website]. The laws in question were passed as part of the government's efforts to deal with terrorism in the region, including Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Niger, Nigeria and Mali. Recognizing the country's need to deal with terrorism, AI says that Senegalese officials could have enacted legislation that dealt with the problem and also protected its citizens' human rights. AI claims the vagueness of the laws are likely to be problematic, as violations such as "insults" and affronts to "morality" could be loosely interpreted in a way that suppress dissident opinions. Other provisions of the new laws criticized by AI include those designed to prevent "defamation of the President of the Republic," "the dissemination of false news," and acts likely to "cause serious political unrest." The report explained that: <blockquote>These laws also contain provisions that threaten the right to a fair trial and create conditions conducive to the use of torture and ill-treatment, in particular against people accused of acts of terror, by extending the period of police custody to up to 12 days and not explicitly establishing that the right of access to a lawyer applies as soon as a person is deprived of their liberty and also includes that lawyer&#8217;s presence during all interrogations.</blockquote> AI has called on the Senegalese government to reverse the laws, and offered recommendations for reversions that would comply with their obligations to international human rights laws. </p>

<p>Numerous humanitarian crises have arisen as countries in Africa try to deal with the threat of terrorism and other causes of civil unrest. Last week, UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-human-rights-investigators-killed-in-the-drc.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the remains of two human rights investigators were found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last month a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-protection-of-civilians-amid-mali-crisis.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help protect civilians in the northern and central regions of Mali amid growing violence and crime sprees. In January, Gambian lawmakers ended <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/gambia-lawmakers-end-state-of-emergency.php">a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and revoked the extension of power for Yahya Jammeh, who lost in the last election. A UN human rights expert in February <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-cameroon-to-restore-internet-to-english-speaking-population.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Cameroonian government to restore Internet access to the country's English-speaking populations. In his statement, Special Rapporteur David Kaye called the delay in restoring Internet access, which had been cut-off since January 17, "an appalling violation of their right to freedom of expression." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Venezuela's Supreme Court of Justice reversed a prior ruling to take over the National Assembly on Sunday. The court effectively <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the legislature in its decision last Wednesday. The Supreme Court and Venezuela's President <a href="http://www.nicolasmaduro.org.ve/biografia/#.WOKTzmTyu8U">Nicolas Maduro</a> [official profile, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1721P8">support</a> [Reuters report] the Socialist Party, while the opposition party leads the legislature.  Protests broke out after the original decision on Wednesday, with protesters accusing the Socialist Party of creating a "dictatorship." The international community also voiced opposition. A special state security committee persuaded the court to reverse their decision.  </p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December 2015 election. Last November the National Assembly postponed a symbolic trial of President Nicolas Maduro in an effort <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/venezuela-national-assembly-suspends-trial-against-president.php">ease political tension</a> [JURIST report] in the nation. In October the National Assembly voted to open <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">criminal impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there is a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. In June government officials asked the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/venezuela-officials-ask-top-court-to-block-referendum-to-remove-president.php">deny a referendum</a> [JURIST report] to remove Maduro proposed by opposition leaders. In April Venezuela's opposition-led parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new referendum rules. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The top prosecutor at the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC)[official website] released a <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=170331-otp-stat">statement</a> [text] Friday alleging that recent acts of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could amount to war crimes. According to <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp/who-s-who/pages/fatou-bensouda.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile], the prosecutor, there have been reports of violent clashes between local militia and Congolese forces, particularly in the Kasai provinces. The reports detail large numbers of killings of both civilians and non-civilians. If the reports are true, the killings could be prosecuted as they fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. Jurisdiction for the Conglese killings would be granted to the ICC under the principle of complementarity derived from the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] which confers on states primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting alleged violent acts within their domains. In a stern warning to the DRC, the prosecutor stated "I further urge the government to resolutely implement and follow-up on the measures announced so that justice is done, and to take the appropriate steps to prevent the subsequent commission of such acts."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13283212">DRC</a> [BBC profile] has seen ongoing violence for the past several decades, which has led to growing international concern. In March seven army officials were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/congo-soldiers-arrested-for-alleged-role-in-february-massacre.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes. Last month Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-calls-on-drc-to-investigate-alleged-killings-by-soldiers.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the DRC to investigate the killing of alleged militia which was recorded in a released video. Earlier in February the UN human rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-human-rights-commissioner-urges-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-to-halt-violence-against-civilia.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the DRC to end violence against civilians. Also in February the UN human rights office <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-office-condemns-civilian-deaths-in-congo.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that at least 101 people were killed by Congolese soldiers. Last October violent protests <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/drc-elections-pushed-back-to-2018.php">erupted</a> [JURIST report] after the electoral commission announced that the next presidential election, originally scheduled for November 2016, would be pushed back to 2018. The commission stated that it needed more time to prepare supplies and voter registration lists. In the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/drc-elections-pushed-back-to-2018.php">beginning of 2016</a> [JURIST report] former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon urged African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to "cling to power."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/55">voted to endorse</a> [nomination record] Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court 11-9, setting up a confirmation vote before the full Senate later this week.  Committee Chairman Senator Chuck Grassley <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04-03-17%20Grassley%20Statement.pdf">stated</a> [text, PDF] that "Judge Gorsuch is eminently qualified. He&#8217;s a mainstream judge who&#8217;s earned the universal respect of his colleagues on the bench and in the bar. He applies the law as we in Congress write it.&#8221; However, Judge Gorsuch did not receive a single vote from a Democrat on the committee.  Democratic Senators are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN1750CM">expected to fillibuster Judge Gorsuch's appointment</a> [Reuters report] by preventing a super majority.  It is unclear whether majority Republicans will attempt to push Judge Gorsuch's nomination through with the "nuclear option" where they would change the policy to only require a simple majority for a Supreme Court nomination.  Many Democrats have appeared to protest Gorsuch's nomination after former President Obama's later-term appointment of Chief Judge Marrick Garland was prevented by the Republican majority.  A vote on Gorsuch's nomination is expected to occur this Friday.</p>

<p>Supreme Court appointments have been a <a href="/forum/2012/10/william-ross-scotus-election.php">highly politicized issue</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the past year, since the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. Trump <a href="/forum/2017/02/William-Ross-gorsuch-senate-consideration.php">nominated Gorsuch</a> [JURIST report] in January to fill the late Justice Scalia's Supreme Court seat. Some have argued that Gorsuch's nomination should be contested and blocked after the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nomination of Judge Merrick Garland</a> by former president Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/merrick-garland-supreme-court-nomination-expires.php">expired in January without a vote</a> [JURIST reports]. Others argue that <a href="/forum/2017/02/William-Ross-gorsuch-senate-consideration.php">judicial appointments deserve to be treated in a non-partisan manner</a> [JURIST op-ed]. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-judge-dismisses-attempt-to-force-vote-on-supreme-court-nominee-merrick-garland.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November attempted to force a vote on former nominee Garland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/OralArgRecordings/16/16-60477_4-3-2017.MP3">oral arguments</a> [audio, MP3] Monday over a Mississippi law dealing with religious objections to same-sex marriage.  The Mississippi law would let merchants and government employees <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/mississippi-lgbt-law-being-argued-federal-appeals-court">cite religious belief in denying services</a> [CNS News report] to same-sex couples.  The law started as <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2016/pdf/history/HB/HB1523.xml">House Bill 1523</a> [text] and was passed and signed by the Mississippi government. A federal judge blocked the law before it could take effect in July 2016.  The Mississippi Democratic Attorney General declined to appeal the ruling that blocked the law from taking effect, therefore private attorneys are handling the governor's appeal.  Those opposed to the legislation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/04/03/us/ap-us-religious-objections-mississippi-the-latest.html">state</a> [NYT report] that it is unconstitutional in light of Supreme Court precedent and unlawfully endorses specific religions.  Those for the bill argue that the law protects people from governmental discrimination against their religious beliefs.</p>

<p>District Judge Reeves had initially <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-declines-to-block-mississippi-religious-freedom-law.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to block the bill in it's entirety and chose instead to hear challenges relating to the bill. Mississippi's governor signed this bill into law last AprilApril, just days after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners. In November 2015the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that same-sex divorce is <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/mississippi-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-divorce.php">legal</a> [JURIST report] within the state. In a 5-4 decision, the high court granted the divorce order citing to the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [JURIST report] as the main legal authority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/web/house-of-the-national-assembly"> Hungarian National Assembly </a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://budapestbeacon.com/public-policy/fidesz-kdnp-passes-lex-ceu/45551"> passed a law </a> [Budapest Beacon report] in a fast-track process which would require foreign universities to have campuses in Hungary and their home countries.This bill <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/29/521948051/hungarian-legislation-threatens-american-university-in-budapest"> threatens to push out </a> [NPR report] <a href="https://www.ceu.edu/"> Central European University </a> (CEU) [official website], which is a private institution in Hungary funded by <a href="https://www.georgesoros.com/"> George Soros </a> [personal website] and is the only foreign university in Hungary that does not also have a campus in its home country. Under this legislation, CEU will have to open a campus in the United States by February 15, 2018 if it wishes to remain open. Proponents of the passed law insist that it was not made to target CEU and claim that it was designed generally to address the administrative shortcomings of foreign universities. This bill has been met with significant protest both within Hungary and internationally.</p>

<p>There have been concerns in the past over Prime Minister Orban's government attacking democracy and human rights. Most recently, on March 7, Hungarian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-detention-of-asylum-seekers.php"> passed </a> [JURIST report] legislation which prevented those seeking asylum from moving about the country or leaving until their claims have been investigated. In November 2016, the Hungarian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/hungary-parliament-rejects-bill-to-block-settlement-of-refugees.php"> rejected an amendment </a> [JURIST report] proposed by Prime Minister Orban which sought to block the settlement of refugees in Hungary. Earlier in November, International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)<a href="/paperchase/2016/11/rights-group-urges-eu-to-address-hungarys-attack-on-human-rights.php"> urged</a> [JURIST report] the EU to better address Hungary's "sustained attack" on human rights and democracy since Prime Minister Viktor Orbán took office in 2010. At the beginning of Orbán's term, Hungary adopted a new constitution called the <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/e/02/00000/The%20New%20Fundamental%20Law%20of%20Hungary.pdf">Fundamental Law</a> [text, pdf], which has been criticized for neglecting international human rights standards and fast-tracking political procedures in a manner that jeopardizes the country's separation of powers.The FIDH's accusations echo <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php"> similar statements </a> [JURIST report] made by Human Rights Watch (HRW) in 2015 against the EU for refusing to take action to address Hungary's laws and practices regarding human rights. In 2013 the Hungarian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hungary-to-propose-further-constitutional-amendments.php"> enacted constitutional amendments </a> [JURIST report] after receiving criticism over its 2012 amendments. HRW and other human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hungary-constitution-changes-do-not-go-far-enough-hrw.php"> criticized </a> [JURIST report] the changes as "largely cosmetic," specifying a lack of resolve over issues surrounding human rights protections in the country.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3535148-Consentdecreebaltimore.html">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] on Monday, ordering the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [DOJ, official website] to undertake a comprehensive review of all police reform activities issued during the Obama administration. During the Obama administration and in light of societal issues with police brutality, the DOJ required many state and local law enforcement agencies to reform their police conduct policies. The stated goal of such orders was to prevent misuse of force and unwarranted incidents of brutality. Sessions's memo orders the DOJ to review these orders and assist the agencies in promoting, "a peaceful and lawful society, where the civil rights of all persons are protected." Agencies are to adhere to several principles listed to promote these goals, including public safety, officer safety, officer morale, and collaboration among the federal, state, local agencies. Sessions said the principle backing the memo is that "the misdeeds of individual bad actors should not impugn or undermine the legitimate and honorable work that law enforcement officers and agencies perform in keeping American communities safe." This principle reflects Sessions's disagreement with the orders imposed on agencies under the Obama administration. The memo concludes with a statement to ensure that any Department activity resulting from the order does not, "delay or impede any pending criminal or national security investigation." </p>

<p>This memo follows Sessions's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-government-should-stop-spending-resources-on-lawsuits-against-local-police.php">March statement</a> [JURIST report] supporting local law enforcement agencies against government lawsuits. The lawsuits were arising from police conduct similar to that criticized under the Obama administration during this past year. In January <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/baltimore-reaches-agreement-with-doj-on-reforming-police-department.php">Baltimore reached an agreement</a> with the DOJ on police reform after a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-baltimore-police-department-engages-in-discriminatory-practices.php">finding</a> [JURIST reports] in August by the DOJ that the police force had violated First and Fourth Amendment rights. In November Cleveland <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/cleveland-submits-revised-use-of-force-policy-to-federal-judge.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] a revised use-of-force policy to a federal judge after a DOJ investigation <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/doj-investigation-into-cleveland-police-finds-pattern-of-excessive-force.php">found</a> [JURIST report] the department was using excessive force. In May Louisiana's governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] an amended hate crimes bill including police, EMS and firefighters in the protected class after instances where police were terrorized and attacked in response to numerous police shootings.<br />

		<title>California Senate approves bill to prohibit state police from enforcing immigration laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://senate.ca.gov/">California State Senate</a> [official website] overwhelmingly passed a <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54">bill</a> [text] on Monday that would expand protections for undocumented immigrants by prohibiting state or local law enforcement from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be barred from working inside county jails and from receiving notifications when a prisoner is released from custody, unless the prisoner has a violent felony record and has been previously deported. The bill states: <br />
<blockquote>"Existing law provides that when there is reason to believe that a person arrested for a violation of specified controlled substance provisions may not be a citizen of the United States, the arresting agency shall notify the appropriate agency of the United States having charge of deportation matters. This bill would repeal those provisions."</blockquote> <a href="http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/">Kevin de León</a> [official website], the leader of the State Senate, said in a <a href="http://sd24.senate.ca.gov/news/2017-04-03-california-senate-leader-statement-senate-passage-california-values-act-sb-54">statement</a> [text] that "[o]ur communities will become more - not less - dangerous if local police are enlisted to enforce immigration laws."</p>

<p>Local legislation curtailing immigration enforcement is a rapidly growing trend across the country. Cities enacting these types of laws and policies have been recently called <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">"sanctuary cities"</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Many of these policies are in response to the executive orders issued in January and March by President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-releases-immigration-enforcement-measures.php">informing</a> [JURIST report] immigration enforcement measures. Lawmakers in California have also advanced two separate types of bills to impede President Trump's immigration policies: <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB6">Senate Bill No. 6</a> [official text] and <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB31">Senate Bill No. 31</a> [official text]. Senate Bill 6 would provide $12 million to pay lawyers for immigrants facing deportation, and Senate Bill 31 would bar state officials from sharing data in the event that the federal government created a Muslim registry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040317zor_e2p3.pdf"> granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in two cases on Monday. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-499.htm">Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-499-cert-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] focuses on a corporate liability issue. The plaintiffs in the case are victims of terrorist attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. They allege that the bank and its offices in New York should be held liable for knowingly financing terrorism. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the bank cannot be held liable.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-6795.htm">Ayestas v. Davis</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-6795-cert-petition.pdf">cert. peition</a>, PDF] the Court has limited the grant of certiorari to consider the conditions under which a defendant has a right to federal funding for an appeal. The case focuses on Ayestas' appeal to the court that his appeals were wrongfully denied by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website]. The lower court ruled that under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3599">18 U.S.C. § 3599(f)</a> [text] the defendant must prove that the funds requested by defendant are reasonably necessary and that he has a substantial need. Ayestas claims that the substantial need standard is too high for a defendant to prove and creates a "logical circularity" as they must prove they could prevail without the full knowledge of the facts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [court website] (ECJ) on Tuesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d5d7d39ca2b85c4824aa12d02fb79b02c2.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyLaxn0?text=&docid=189542&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=407920">upheld</a> [text] a visa ban on an Iranian student seeking to study in Germany. Sahar Fahimian applied to study sensitive security topics at a University in Germany, but was subsequently denied the visa by the German government, citing various security issues that could be used once the degree was obtained. The court decided that it was up to national authorities to decide if the visa ban was justified by security concerns. The decision allows countries to refuse visas, but requires them to state the reason for the denial. The ECJ added that, "the German court will have to ascertain whether the decision to refuse the student a visa is based on duly justified grounds and a sufficiently solid factual basis". The German court will now have to decide if the state had valid reason to deny Fahimian the visa. Fahimian has already obtained a masters degree from an EU institution and was attempting to pursue a Doctoral degree focusing on security of mobile systems. </p>

<p>Issuing visas for foreign nationals is not something new to international diplomacy, yet in recent times deciding stricter means for issuing visas has become a more common trend. In the United States, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] has continually attempted to implement a temporary ban on nations in which the government believes impose a risk to the security of the country. JURIST Guest Columnist Jonathan Hafetz examines the <a href="/forum/2017/03/jonathan-hafetz-trump-travel.php">latest travel ban</a> [JURIST Op-ed] issued by the government, focusing on the underlying issue of being based around religion. In March the EU top court ordered that members <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-nations-do-not-have-to-issue-humanitarian-visas.php">do not have to issue</a> [JURIST report] humanitarian visas, which challenged the belief in Europe that protection should be given to those fleeing war zones. Also in March, the Israeli Knesset <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/israel-knesset-passes-legislation-limiting-entry-visas-and-residency-rights.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] limiting entry visas to anyone from countries who call for boycotts against the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court </a>[official website] on Tuesday unanimously decided in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-9260_8nj9.pdf">Dean v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF] that trial courts could consider mandatory minimums when imposing sentences for other underlying offenses. In <u>Dean</u>, the appellant had been convicted of several robbery and firearm charges and two additional charges of " possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">18 U. S. C. §924</a>," which carried mandatory minimums totalling 30 years. At sentencing, Dean asked that the judge consider those mandatory minimums when calculating an appropriate sentence. This was because punishment for the other charges was to be imposed &#8220;in addition to the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime,&#8221; the judge, however, interpreted the statute to mean that additional sentences would have to be calculated independent of any mandatory minimums and Dean appealed.</p>

<p>The debate over the constitutionality of mandatory minimums has been on-going. Last year the Maryland Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/maryland-senate-approves-landmark-criminal-justice-reform-bill.php">unanimously approved a landmark criminal justice bill </a>[JURIST report], known as the Justice Reinvestment Act, which would significantly change how non-violent drug offenders are sentenced, shifting focus from prison to treatment. The changes in the sentencing structure would allow the state to save money on prison costs and allow those serving mandatory minimums to appeal their sentences. In 2015 the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/obama-urges-criminal-justice-reforms-to-reduce-sentences-for-nonviolent-drug-offenders.php">voted to move forward on the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 </a>[JURIST report] , which would cut back on mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders. Several  police chiefs were concerned about reducing sentences, including Chief Will Johnson of Arlington, Texas, who noted that the government has been hesitant to assist with drug and mental health treatments as alternatives to incarceration. Following the introduction of the bill, US President Barack Obama argued for overhauling the nation's sentencing laws  in front of top law enforcement officials at the 122nd Annual International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference and Exposition. The president argued that placing large numbers of nonviolent drug offenders in prison was neither fair nor an effective way of combating crime, stating that "it is possible for us to come up with strategies that effectively reduce the damage of the drug trade without relying solely on incarceration." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> on Monday held in<u> <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1248_7mi8.pdf">McLane v. U.S. Equal Employment<br />
Opportunity Commission</a></u> (EEOC) [opinion, PDF] that " A district court&#8217;s decision whether to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not de novo." The Court relied on two factors, one considering the "longstanding practice of the courts of appeals[']" review process of administrative subpoenas filed by the EEOC and  secondly, "basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review." Weighing both, the court found that the appropriate standard was an abuse of discretion standard and vacated and remanded the lower judgment.</p>

<p>Petitioner<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-cross-border-shooting.php"> argued</a> [JURIST report] that the matter should be subject to discretionary review as the EEOC's investigative authority was limited by the relevance of the charge and not plenary. The petitioner further asserted that it is traditional and common among the appellate courts to grant deferential review for subpoenas and search warrants. Finally, petitioner argued that in these matters, due to the fact and context-intensive nature of the dispute, the district court is in the best position to decide the matter and therefore deserve discretionary review. Respondent in return argued that because the court of appeals found legal error in the district court's decision, its <em>de novo</em> review was consistent in subpoena enforcement actions. Respondent also argued that this is not an appropriate matter for the court as both parties agreed to <u>de novo</u> standard of review before the panel and the Ninth Circuit commonly applies such review. Furthermore, respondent argued that the Supreme Court should simply affirm the court of appeals decision instead of remanding the matter back to a lower court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French foreign minister <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/the-minister-and-the-ministers-of-state/jean-marc-ayrault/">Jean-Marc Ayrault</a> [official profile] <a href="https://twitter.com/jeanmarcayrault/status/849218185220026369">condemned</a> [Twitter post, in French] a suspected chemical attack in Syria and <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/syria/events/article/chemical-attack-in-syria-statement-by-jean-marc-ayrault-minister-of-foreign">called an emergency meeting</a> [statement] of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">United Nations Security Council</a> [official website] to address the issue. The <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/en/">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> (SOHR) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=64104">reported</a> [SOHR report] that an attack took place on a hospital in in Idlib region of Syria, killing 58-including 11 children, involving the use of chemical weapons. It is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-france-idUSKBN17619J">suspected</a> [<em>Reuters</em> report] that the Syrian government ordered the attack on the rebel-held province. Ayrault stated, "France has, since the start of the conflict, done its utmost to ensure that the international community sheds full light on the use of chemical weapons in Syria, identifies the perpetrators and draws the necessary conclusions in order to put an end to it."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In February the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-syria-systematically-exterminating-detainees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government is systematically exterminating detainees. In November Human Rights Watch released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php">hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity. In October France opened a torture <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/france-opens-torture-inquiry-into-syria-government-under-assad.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of the Syrian government under Assad in detention facilities. Additionally, Amnesty International released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-us-allies-in-syria-committing-war-crimes.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in October detailing the possibility of war crimes in Syria. The AI report criticized the Syrian government by stating that "they have maintained unlawful sieges, restricted humanitarian assistance deliveries, deliberately attacked civilians, and carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, arbitrary detentions, abductions and enforced disappearances."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkihaley?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Nikki Haley</a> [official Twitter] stated to reporters on Monday that the US will continue to take action to sanction terrorists through the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website], despite other countries utilizing their veto power. Haley did not name China, but her comments come in the midst of India's <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-on-terror-sanctions-veto-will-not-preclude-us-from-acting/articleshow/58006604.cms">ongoing efforts</a> to sanction Masood Azhar despite China's <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-blocked-us-move-to-get-masood-azhar-banned-by-un/articleshow/57029498.cms">repeated vetoes</a> [<em>Times of India</em> reports]. Azhar is the head of the Jaish-e-Mohammad, which is a jihadist group in Kashmir. Haley became the UN Ambassador after President Donald Trump's inauguration, and the US <a href="https://usun.state.gov/highlights/7738">assumes the role</a> [press release] of President of the Security Council for the month of April per a rotating schedule.</p>

<p>Strategic voting and use of the veto power of the P5 nations on the Security Council has been utilized frequently in recent years. In December the Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-security-council-passes-resolution-against-settlements-us-does-not-veto-against-pressure-from-tru.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution which establishes that Israeli settlements in Palestine have no legal validity, but the US notably abstained from the vote. In October the Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/russia-vetoes-security-council-resolution-on-syria.php">failed to adopt</a> [JURIST report] two measures to immediately cease airstrikes and military bombardment missions in Syria due to Russia's veto. In July of 2015  Russia <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/russia-vetoes-un-plane-attack-tribunal.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a UN Security Council resolution that would have created a new tribunal to prosecute those involved in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in the Ukraine in July 2014. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Donald Trump on Monday signed a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/34">bill</a> [S.J.Res.34, materials] officially <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/03/president-donald-j-trump-signs-hjres-69-hjres-83-hr-1228-sjres-34-law">repealing internet privacy regulations</a> [press release] set by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term. A pending FCC rule, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/02/2016-28006/protecting-the-privacy-of-customers-of-broadband-and-other-telecommunications-services">Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services</a> [text], would have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-trump-idUSKBN1752PR">required</a> [Reuters report] internet providers to seek consumer consent before sharing and selling their private information.</p>

<p>Last month, Republicans seeking to invalidate the rule had the current bill considered before the <a href="https://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official websites] and <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-house-votes-to-repeal-internet-privacy-rules.php">received approval</a> [JURIST report] despite the lack of Democratic support. Recently, 46 Democratic Senators argued against the bill in the name of protecting Americans' privacy. FCC Republicans, including Chairman <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai">Ajit Pai</a> [official profile], have praised the bill, stating that the old regulations actually favored internet companies by allowing websites to acquire more data than internet providers normally would. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazil's top court, the <a href="http://www.tse.jus.br/">Supreme Electoral Tribunal</a> (TSE) [official website, in Portuguese], on Tuesday suspended the trial of President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36070366">Michel Temer</a> [BBC backgrounder] who is accused of receiving illegal donations during his 2014 campaign. Following former president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dilma-Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff's</a> [Britannica profile] removal from office, her lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">presented evidence</a> [JURIST report] in November that Temer received a US $295,351 deposit after the same amount was donated by construction firm <a href="http://www.andradegutierrez.com/">Andrade Gutierrez</a> to the <a href="http://pmdb.org.br/">Brazilian Democratic Movement Party</a> [official websites, in Portuguese]. Temer's legal team has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-brazil-corruption-temer-idUKKBN1761J6?il=0">denied</a> [Reuters report] such allegations. Currently, the TSE will not issue a verdict until May at the earliest. Until then, the TSE will hear additional witnesses and arguments from Brazil's political parties. </p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigation and trials. Last month, Brazil's top prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brazil-prosecutor-requests-83-new-investigations-into-petrobras-scandal.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the TSE to open 83 more investigations into politicians in connection to the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=petrobras&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Petrobras scandal </a> [JURIST news archive]. More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the scandal, and charges have been filed against some of Brazil's most powerful politicians, <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">including</a> [JURIST report] former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Although not directly related to Petrobras, in August the Brazil Senate <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">voted to convict</a> [JURIST op-ed] Rousseff on allegations that she used improper accounting to cover-up a growing budget deficit and illegal loans from state-owned banks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of <a href="https://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senators</a> [official site] on Tuesday<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-paul-polis-and-farenthold-bill-requires-warrants-to-search-americans-digital-devices-at-the-border"> introduced</a> [press release] a bipartisan <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=0FC61A3A-122B-4A0C-9AED-B68C3349AA61&download=1"> bill</a> [official summary, PDF] to require government agents to get a warrant when searching electronic devices of US citizens at the border. The  <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/?id=9CDE0A37-24DD-4D05-B199-C7E160CAA088&download=1">Protecting Data at the Border Act</a> [text, PDF] seeks to allow citizens to deny a request of border agents to search their electronic devices without being denied entry or exit at the border except for in emergency situations. The bill requires either a warrant or probable cause to search or seize a device. <blockquote>A Governmental entity may not seize any electronic  equipment belonging to or in the possession of a United States person at the border unless there is probable cause to believe that the electronic equipment contains information that is relevant to an allegation that the United  States person has committed a felony.</blockquote> Furthermore the bill requires data collection of the number of times agents access digital data, request access to data, or attempt so access data of citizens as well as create a record of the number of non-citizens for the same. The Senate must approve the measure before it moves to the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House</a>[official site]. </p>

<p>The bill comes on the heels of recent issues impacting digital data and privacy.  The US Congress <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-house-votes-to-repeal-internet-privacy-rules.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] last week to repeal Internet privacy regulations, preventing the Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services  rule from entering into force. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy , Joseph Cannataci, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-condemns-modern-day-surveillance-laws.php">presented a report</a> [JURIST report]  to the Human Rights Council in early March condemning modern-day surveillance legislation and expressing grave concerns regarding the threat to privacy rights in the digital age. Facebook  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/facebook-to-settle-in-class-action-privacy-suit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a class-action lawsuit levied against aslo in March for its prior practice of scanning private messages to aid in ads. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court of Missouri <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=111493">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday a parole revocation was improper because the court failed to consider reasons why an indigent defendant failed to pay court cost. The case dealt with a man named William Fleming who was unable to repay $4,236.50 in three years as required by the court in conjunction with his probation. After missing numerous payments, the lower court revoked his probation even though his probation officer requested an alternative plan without costs. Fleming argued it was a violation of his due process rights to revoke his bond for failing to pay when he complied with the terms of his probation except for repaying the court costs. The Missouri Supreme Court noted found <blockquote>The sentencing court violated Mr. Fleming&#8217;s due process and equal protection rights when it improperly revoked his probation for failure to pay court costs without first inquiring as to the reasons for his failure to pay, making findings as to whether he willfully refused to pay or failed to make bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to pay, and considering the conditions he has already satisfied or other alternative measures of punishment. Therefore, Mr. Fleming is ordered discharged from his sentence of imprisonment and subsequent parole and restored to his status as a probationer.</blockquote> The lower court has 60 days to investigate and initiate a new revocation hearing or Fleming is off probation.</p>

<p>The issue of finances as a factor for revocation or imprisonment is a contested issue. The Maryland Court of Appeals<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/maryland-top-court-defendants-cannot-be-held-before-trial-if-unable-to-afford-bail.php"> adopted a rule</a> [JURIST report]  in February ending the practice of holding criminal defendants in jail before trial when they cannot afford bail. Last June A lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/lawsuit-accuses-louisiana-judge-of-running-debtors-prison.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana judge of running a modern-day debtors' prison for sentencing people to jail when they could not afford fees.  Last March The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)  <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/aclu-settles-debtors-prison-lawsuit-with-biloxi.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the city of Biloxi, Mississippi,  in a lawsuit alleging that the detention of defendants unable to pay fines for misdemeanor charges exhibited deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights. Also last March The US Department of Justice (DOJ)  <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] state court systems to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] ruled Tuesday that LGBT employees are <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/legal-docs/downloads/hively_in_20170404_opinion.pdf">protected from workplace discrimination</a> [opinion, PDF] under <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</a> [text]. The plaintiff in the case was Kimberly Hively, who <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/1fe7c55acba44b4094d0de338db9b8be/court-civil-rights-law-covers-lgbt-workplace-bias">claims</a> [AP report] that she was not hired by Ivy Tech Community College because of her sexual orientation. The judges found that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a form of sex discrimination barred under the act. The decision explains that:<br />
<blockquote>Viewed through the lens of the gender non-conformity line of cases, Hively represents the ultimate case of failure to conform to the female stereotype (at least as understood in a place such as modern America, which views heterosexuality as the norm and other forms of sexuality as exceptional): she is not heterosexual.... Hively&#8217;s claim is no different from the claims brought by women who were rejected for jobs in traditionally male workplaces, such as fire departments, construction, and policing. The employers in those cases were policing the boundaries of what jobs or behaviors they found acceptable for a woman (or in some cases, for a man). </blockquote> This is the first time that a federal appeals court has made this legal finding and it comes just a few weeks after a court in Atlanta made the opposite ruling. </p>

<p>Throughout the US, the rights of LGBT persons remain a highly controversial issue. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/fifth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-religious-versus-lgbt-rights.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on Monday over a Mississippi law dealing with religious objections to same-sex marriage and would permit merchants to deny services to same-sex couples. Last month, Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/utah-governor-signs-bill-repealing-part-of-law-that-barred-advocacy-of-homosexuality.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] amendments to SB 196, repealing language that barred "advocacy of homosexuality" in Utah public schools. In February the Arkansas Supreme Court on <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-citys-lgbt-protections.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Fayetteville city ordinance broadening nondiscrimination laws to include sexual orientation or gender identity was invalid under a state statute that prohibited cities from adopting or enforcing ordinances prohibiting discrimination beyond that barred by state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's Indigenous Affairs Minister <a href="https://ministers.dpmc.gov.au/scullion">Nigel Scullion</a> [Official website] on Tuesday rejected a <a href="http://unsr.vtaulicorpuz.org/site/index.php/en/statements/181-end-statement-australia">call</a> [press release] from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples <a href="http://unsr.vtaulicorpuz.org/site/">Victoria Tauli-Corpuz</a> [official website] to create specific targets to improve the treatment of Aboriginal peoples. Tauli-Corpuz visited Australia between March 20 and April 3. She noted that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders represent 3% of the country's population, but 27% of the country's prison population. She also noted that 95% of the children who are incarcerated at the Cleveland Youth Detention Centre were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Australia has previously started the Closing the Gap strategy which is meant to close gaps between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to that of the general Australian population in the areas of health, education, employment, and others. Tauli-Corpuz recommends that targets on justice be included in this Closing the Gap strategy. Scullion has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-05/nigel-scullion-rejects-un-call-for-indigenous-justice-target/8419570">rejected</a> [ABC News Report] the idea of setting targets on justice, stating that &#8220;[t]argets are appropriate in some circumstances in some jurisdictions and not in others.&#8221; Scullion also stated that the government does not poses the appropriate "levers" to control the incarceration rates of these groups.</p>

<p>Australia's treatment of Aboriginal people has drawn criticism from the international community. Tauli-Corpuz's report criticized several areas of treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-reports-on-appalling-living-conditions-of-aboriginal-australians.php">calling</a> [JURIST report] their treatment 'appalling.' Last month, another UN rapporteur said that Australia's policies to prevent violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">do not benefit</a> [JURIST report] Aboriginal women. In December the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-australians-to-end-all-forms-of-racial-discrimination.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Australia to end all forms of racial discrimination, including against indigenous Australians. Last July Amnesty International said Australia must <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-australia-must-address-abuse-of-child-prisoners.php">address</a> [JURIST report] abuse of child prisoners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UK high court on Wednesday stayed the extradition of a British man, Rosslee Charles, to Turkey given concerns over his safety. Charles, a gay man, was convicted of homosexual rape in Turkey in 2006. Before the trial, Charles had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/apr/05/briton-rosslee-charles-escapes-turkey-extradition-court-hears-prison-torture">held for six months</a> [Guardian report] in a Turkish prison. During that time he was assaulted by guards and fellow prisoners who beat him while being called derogatory names. According to written submissions to the court, he was also "forcibly converted to Islam and beaten when he made mistakes in the Arabic text that he was forced to read out loud. Charles was allowed to return to the UK before the trial due to fears for his safety. A lower court had agreed to his extradition on the Turkish government's assurance that Charles would serve his seven-year sentence in a wing designated for LGBT prisoners. The high court allowed Charles' application to deny extradition on the grounds that, despite the assurance, the special unit was "wholly unworkable." Due to mass arrests following a failed coup in Turkey there was also fear that the lack of staff would deny Charles the required monitoring for his own safety. </p>

<p>Since the failed coup in Turkey in July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. Turkish Labor Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu said that authorities have dismissed more than 90,000 public servants for alleged connections to the <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/turkey-dismisses-more-than-90000-public-servants-in-post-coup-purge.php">coup</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March around 330 individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">put on trial </a>[JURIST report] for alleged involvement in the attempted coup. In February Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to "change course and to display the responsibility and tolerance expected in a democratic society." The commissioner's document comes amid increased scrutiny of Turkey's treatment of journalists and other members of Turkish society, allegedly leading to the repression of free speech and self-censorship.  In January a judge for the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-court-orders-turkey-to-release-judge.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of Turkish judge Aydin Sefa Akay who was detained in July. In November Turkey significantly restricted the activities of NGOs like human rights organizations and children's groups and <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested opposition party leaders</a> [JURIST reports] alleging they were connected to terror organizations. In October Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-turkish-emergency-decrees-permitting-government-sanctioned-torture.php">warned </a>[JURIST report] that the emergency decrees put in place after the failed coup, had resulted in serious human rights violations. In July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-turkish-government-attacking-press-freedom-in-coup-aftermath.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Turkey for attacking the freedom of the press by issuing arrest warrants for 42 journalists.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/portal/">state of Massachusetts</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ma-appellatecourts.org/display_docket.php?dno=SJC-12276">requested</a> [case docket] the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] find that state authorities lack jurisdiction to detain illegal immigrants.  This <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/massachusetts-immigration-idUSL2N1HC21Q">request</a> [Reuters report] comes after the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency requested courts and law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants in custody for up to 48 hours after their case was resolved.  The state of Massachusetts in turn has argued that detaining someone after their case is resolved amounts to a new arrest without sufficient authority.  Massachusetts has also argued that state law does not give law enforcement the basis to arrests people based upon deportation proceedings.</p>

<p>Local legislation curtailing immigration enforcement is a rapidly growing trend across the country. Cities enacting these types of laws and policies have been recently called "<a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">sanctuary cities</a>" [JURIST op-ed]. Many of these policies are in response to the executive orders issued in January and March by President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-releases-immigration-enforcement-measures.php">informing</a> [JURIST report] immigration enforcement measures. Lawmakers in California have also advanced two separate types of bills to impede President Trump's immigration policies: <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB6">Senate Bill No. 6</a> [official text] and <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB31">Senate Bill No. 31</a> [official text]. Senate Bill 6 would provide $12 million to pay lawyers for immigrants facing deportation, and Senate Bill 31 would bar state officials from sharing data in the event that the federal government created a Muslim registry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Security Council conducted emergency talks on Wednesday regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that killed numerous civilians. According to <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sgsm18484.doc.htm">statement </a> [press release] made by UN Secretary-General António Guterres Tuesday the UN is not currently in a position to independently verify if chemical weapons were used. The <a href="https://www.opcw.org/">Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> (OPCW) [official website] has <a href="https://www.opcw.org/news/article/opcw-press-release-on-allegations-of-chemical-weapons-use-in-southern-idlib-syria/">started gathering information</a> [press release] to confirm if chemical weapons were used. The Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, which works to investigate human rights abuses in Syria since 2011, has said it <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21481&LangID=E">supports </a> [press release] OPCW's fact-finding mission. According Gueterres, the use of chemical weapons constitutes a threat to international peace and security and it such weapons were used its a serious violation of international law.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria </a>[JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact, particularly for the war torn region of Aleppo. In Feburary, according to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">HRW</a> [advocacy site], the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted </a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel controlled portions of Aleppo. The same month, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">more than 13,000 prisoners were hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at Saydnaya prison. In December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] accused Syrian pro-government forces of going door to door and <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-systematic-killing-of-civilians-in-aleppo.php">systematically killing civilians</a> [JURIST report] in at least four Aleppo neighborhoods. The Russian/Syrian coalition committed war crimes in Aleppo during September and October, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/hrw-russia-and-syria-has-commited-war-crimes-in-aleppo.php">said </a>[JURIST report] in early December. Earlier that month UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/united-nations-ask-for-the-security-council-to-help-citizens-in-eastern-aleppo.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] the international community to unite with the UN Security Council to protect civilians in the eastern Aleppo region. US Central Command <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/us-concludes-syria-airstrikes-not-in-violation-of-international-law.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] in November that airstrikes carried out by the US-led coalition near Dayr az Zawr, Syria, in September did not violate international law. Also in November a group of German lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/germany-lawyers-file-suit-against-syria-president-for-war-crimes-in-aleppo.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the filing of charges against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, alleging that he committed war crimes in Aleppo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/">New York Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2017/Apr17/16opn17-Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that law-enforcement can seize private <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Facebook-HQ-166793820034304/">Facebook</a> [corporate website] account information.  The court <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/04/04/state-court-rules-police-can-seize-your-facebook-activity/">ruled</a> [NY Post report] that Facebook could not contest the warrants and therefore the court could not decide the matter.  The court found that only users themselves have the right to challenge warrants in criminal proceedings.  However, while being forced to comply with search warrants seeking access to private accounts, Facebook cannot warn users about the disclosure.  The case is a result of the <a href="http://manhattanda.org/">Manhattan DA</a> [official website] seeking search warrants in 2013 for the accounts of people in connection with a disability-benefits fraud case.  Due to the gag order, the court has stated the only remedy for Facebook users is to sue for invasion of privacy after the fact.  Facebook has kept open the possibility of taking the case to the US Supreme Court arguing that the case addresses unresolved issues about online privacy.  </p>

<p>Governments around the world have re-examined their data privacy laws in the wake of a myriad of data leaks, including the <a href="/feature/2013/07/edward-snowden.php">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST backgrounder] leaks. National governments around the world have <a href="/hotline/2017/01/Courtney-Bowman-data-localization.php">attempted</a> [JURIST op-ed] to gain control over data transferred within their borders. In March the US House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/us-house-approves-update-of-e-mail-privacy-laws.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a measure that would update US privacy laws in regards to e-mails and cloud storage. In October 2015 the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US was not sufficiently protected. In June 2015 a court in The Hague <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/dutch-court-holds-data-retention-law-violates-privacy.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Dutch law that allowed the government to retain telephone and Internet data of Dutch citizens for up to 12 months in an effort to combat terrorism and organized crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cabinet of German Chancellor <a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/DE/Startseite/startseite_node.html">Angela Merkel</a> [official website, in German] approved draft legislation on Wednesday that would impose fines on social media websites for failing to delete users' entries that violate German hate speech laws. The <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/german-justice-minister-calls-for-hefty-fines-to-combat-online-hate-speech/a-38300446">fines</a> [DW report] could reportedly be as high as 50 million Euros ($53 million). The law would make the websites responsible for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-fakenews-idUSKBN16L14G">removing</a> [Reuters report] the illegal content and making regular reports to the German government on complaints filed. It also seeks to make it easier for social media users to report offensive conduct. Critics of the law argue that it could limit freedom of expression and suppress speech on the Internet. The legislation will next be submitted to the lower house of parliament, where the bill is expected to be approved.</p>

<p>Internationally, a governmental balance between freedom of expression and eliminating the dangers of hate speech is still a significant problem. Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein marked the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-chief-urges-international-community-to-target-hate-speech.php">emphasizing</a> [JURIST report] the importance of curtailing hate speech. He urged states to adopt new legislation "expressly prohibiting racist hate speech, including the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, and threats or incitement to violence." In March the German Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/german-top-court-refuses-to-ban-neo-nazi-group.php">rejected efforts</a> [JURIST report] to ban the far-right ultranationalist political party National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), finding the group does not pose a sufficient threat to the German government. Last year, the Dutch district court of Haarlem <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/netherlands-court-finds-right-wing-mp-geert-wilders-guilty-of-hate-speech.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch right wing political party, Party for Freedom, was guilty of hate speech. The incident in question happened in March 2014, during a political rally where Wilders promised to reduce the number of Morrocans in the Netherlands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iceland's <a href="http://www.althingi.is/english">Parliament</a> [official website] presented a <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/pdf/146/s/0570.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday that would require all public and private companies that employ more than 25 people to prove they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/05/iceland-equal-pay-women-men-law">provide</a> [AFP report] equal pay for employees. If a company is unable to prove employees are paid equally through an auditing system, the company could receive fines. The legislation would apply to discrimination based on gender, race, national origin, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation and gender identity. While Iceland ranked first in the World Economic Forum's 2015 <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/report-highlights/">global gender performance</a> [report], this bill aims to eliminate the 7% wage gap that exists in the country and would be the first of its kind in world history. The bill will now be <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39501616">subject</a> [BBC Report] to a series of debates, and if it passes, it will take effect in January 2018.</p>

<p>The <a href="/forum/2014/05/dana-purvis-equal-pay.php">gender pay gap</a> is an issue that is being addressed across the globe. In 2014, the California legislature found a 16-cent wage gap between men's and women's pay and a wage gap of 44 cents between Latina women and white men. In October of 2015, the California Governor <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/california-adopts-fair-pay-act.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0351-0400/sb_358_bill_20151006_chaptered.pdf">Fair Pay Act</a> [official text] aimed at closing the wage gap between male and female employees. In March of 2015, the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">House of Lords</a> [official website] debated a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/parliament-considering-changes-to-a-law-that-require-large-firms-to-reveal-equal-pay.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] passed through <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">Parliament</a> [official website] that would require certain businesses to reveal whether there are differences in the pay of male and female employees. In contemplation of International Women's Day on March 8, 2015, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat">Eurostat</a> [official website], the statistical office of the European Union (EU), <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6729998/3-05032015-AP-EN.pdf">revealed</a> [press release] that women, on average, earned 16 percent less than men in the EU, and that the UK has the sixth-largest gender pay gap within the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] has issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3535403-Lasnik-Order.html">preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF] to block Seattle's first-in-the-nation law that will allow drivers for taxis, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> [official websites] to unionize. The law, passed in 2015, allows drivers who are considered independent contractors to unionize and collectively bargain for benefits such as healthcare. The law was challenged by two separate suits, one brought by a small group of drivers from each company, the other by the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> [official website]. The Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/judge-puts-blocks-for-now-seattle-law-allowing-uber-and-lyft-drivers-to-unionize/">asserts</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] that under federal law, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), contractors are not permitted to unionize. Excluding from unionization under the NLRA are public-sector workers, agriculture workers, domestic workers, supervisors and independent contractors. The first three are permitted to unionize under various state laws. City attorneys argue that independent contractors are more akin to the first three than supervisors and the city has the authority to permit them to unionize. The Chamber contends that while drivers have been permitted to set uniform rates to deter under-charing, they have never been able to collectively bargain. Should the city law be upheld, the business models for Lyft and Uber would "likely be disrupted in fundamental and irreparable ways." The presiding judge stressed that the "Order should not be read as a harbinger of what the ultimate decision in this case will be" when all motions have been fully considered.</p>

<p>With the rapid growth of companies like Lyft and Uber, ride-sharing services have been among the most <a href="/feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. In March a judge for the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-approves-class-action-settlement-with-lyft-drivers.php">approved a $27 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit between Lyft and its drivers. The suit challenged Lyft's characterization of the drivers as independent contractors. In December the European wing of Uber was <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in Denmark on charges of assisting drivers in their violation of taxi laws, although Copenhagen prosecutor Vibeke Thorkil-Jensen stated that this is just a test case seeking judicial assessment of Uber's involvement in the illegal acts of two of its drivers. Last April Uber <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/uber-reaches-settlement-with-drivers-in-labor-dispute.php">settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by 385,000 drivers in California and Massachusetts regarding their status as independent contractors. In several states, ride-sharing companies have met significant legal opposition, frequently led by competitors such as the taxi industry. <a href="/feature/2015/11/future-of-ride-sharing.php">Other unresolved questions</a> [JURIST backgrounder] surrounding this new business model continue to prompt debate among lawmakers.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56496#.WOUnXjsrJeW">voiced deep regret</a> [press release] regarding US decision to cut financial support for the UN population agency. According to Guterres, the decision is based on an inaccurate depiction of the nature and importance of the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/">UN Population Fund</a> (UNFPA) [official website]. Guterres says the funding cut could have devastating effects on the health of vulnerable women, female children, and their families. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] cut funding back in March after allegations that the UNFPA supports, or participates in the management of, a program in China of "coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization." The UNFPA <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/press/statement-unfpa-us-decision-withhold-funding">denies these allegations </a> [press release] and states it works to promote human rights.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to be a controversial issue in the US. In February the US House of Representatives recently <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST commentary] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. That same month the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the Mandatory Delay Law, which requires that a woman wait for 24 hours after receiving counseling from a physician before she can have an abortion. Also in February the <a href="http://www.pasen.gov/">Pennsylvania Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [Official website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/05/ukraine-new-law-targets-anti-corruption-activists-journalists">condemned</a> [press release] on Wednesday a new Ukrainian <a href="http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1975-19/">anti-corruption law</a> [text, in Ukrainian] that requires activists and journalists who report on government corruption to file public declarations of their personal assets. The law was passed by the Ukrainian Parliament on March 23 and signed by President Petro Poroshenko on March 27. An amendment had been introduced to exempt independent groups and journalists, but that amendment was not included in the final law. Failure by activists to declare their personal assets is punishable by up to two years in prison. HRW has stated that the new law will have a "chilling effect on activists and journalists." President Poroshenko has stated that he will create a working group to amend the law to to exclude activists, but this is expected to take some time. </p>

<p>Ukraine has undergone significant criticisms of its human rights in recent years. A UN report <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-report-details-suffering-of-ukraine-citizens.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in December of several human rights violations against civilians near the "contact line" between the Ukrainian government and armed groups. Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July Amnesty International and Human Rights released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in the Ukraine have <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">subjected citizens to</a> [JURIST report] "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. In June the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] released a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa12/5942/2017/en/">report</a> [official report] Wednesday criticizing the role two companies are playing in a refugee "processing" system <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/spanish-corporate-giant-ferrovial-makes-millions-from-australias-torture-of-refugees-on-nauru/">Australia is carrying out</a> [press release] on the Pacific island of Nauru. AI says that for multiple years, Australia has operated an offshore processing site on Nauru where refugees and asylum seekers are isolated in remote locations and subjected to cruel and degrading conditions and are often forbidden from leaving the island even when granted refugee status. Lucy Graham, AI's Researcher on Business and Human Rights, stated that: <br />
<blockquote>The Australian government has created an island of despair for refugees and people seeking asylum on Nauru, but an island of profit for companies making millions of dollars from a system so deliberately and inherently cruel and abusive it amounts to torture. By knowingly enabling the continuation of this system, which is specifically designed to cause suffering and deter people from traveling to Australia by boat to seek asylum, Broadspectrum and Ferrovial are unequivocally complicit in this abuse.</blockquote></p>

<p>The rights of refugees has been of international concern and Australia has particularly been under fire for its treatment of refugees. In February a petition was filed in the International Criminal Court by a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/icc-petition-accuses-australia-of-violating-refugee-human-rights.php">coalition of legal experts</a> [JURIST report] claiming the offshore island detention constitutes a human rights violation. Last October, AI accused Australia of using the island of Nauru as an <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/amnesty-australia-using-naura-as-open-air-prison.php">"open-air prison"</a> [JURIST report] to prevent immigration of asylum seekers. In August <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-announces-plans-to-close-detention-center-on-manus-island.php">Australia announced</a> [JURIST report] that Australia and Papua New Guinea intend on closing the controversial Manus Island detention center. That same month AI and Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-ignoring-inhumane-treatment-of-refugees-to-deter-others-report.php">issued reports</a> [JURIST report] stating that Australia is ignoring inhumane treatment of detainees in Nauru. Papua New Guinea officials claimed last May that <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">refugees are not being detained</a> [JURIST report] on Manus Island, as they are given access to mainland Australia. The statement by officials followed a ruling by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court that the Australian off-shore detention facility was illegal, in <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">direct opposition to a ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the Australian Supreme Court earlier this year that the off-shore detention was legal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Donald Trump on Tuesday <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2017-07064.pdf">removed</a> [executive order] Chief Political Strategist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37971742">Steve Bannon</a> [BBC backgrounder] from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc">National Security Council</a> (NSC). Bannon was a controversial pick for the council, and according to the administration, was only placed on the council to help Trump control then-national security adviser <a href="http://www.michaeltflynn.com/">Michael Flynn</a> [official website]. With Flynn <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/flynn-resignation-ltr.pdf">resigning</a> [text] in February, the administration says Bannon is no longer need on the NSC. Instead, Bannon will continue to advise Trump, while National Security Adviser <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39033934">H.R. McMaster</a> [BBC backgrounder] will take control of both the NSC and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-advisory-council">Homeland Security Council</a> [official website]. Homeland Security Adviser <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/us/politics/thomas-bossert-national-security-trump.html?_r=0">Tom Bossert</a> [NYT backgrounder] will now be under McMaster's command as well. </p>

<p>Trump's presidency has faced a good deal of controversy. Earlier this week, Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-repeals-fcc-internet-privacy-rules-requiring-consumer-consent.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] officially repealing internet privacy regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term. A pending FCC rule, Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services, would have required internet providers to seek consumer consent before sharing and selling their private information. The week before, advocacy group Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-trump-meeting-with-egypt-president-ignores-rights-abuses.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Trump's plan to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, saying the move effectively endorses the country's poor recent human rights record. That same day, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rejects-president-trumps-free-speech-defense-to-rally-violence.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Trump's free speech defense in response to his alleged inciting of violence among protesters during his presidential campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) spokesman <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/improving-border-security-and-public-safety">announced</a> [materials] Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration was no longer planning to separate women and children at the US' southern border as a means of deterring immigration. Speaking to a <a href="https://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> [official website] panel, Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/person/john-f-kelly">John Kelly</a> [official website] stated that it was no longer within the Trump administration's plans to separate families. Speaking anonymously, a DHS official <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-kelly-idUSKBN1771VW">attributed</a> [Reuters report] the change in procedure to declining numbers of women attempting to travel to the US with their children. </p>

<p>Trump's travel bans have engendered significant legal controversy leading to nationwide litigation. Last week, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the state of Hawaii's request to convert the temporary restraining order blocking President Trump's travel ban earlier this month into a preliminary injunction. Earlier that week, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-expedites-review-of-trump-travel-ban.php">ordered an expedited schedule</a> [JURIST report] for the appeal of a lower court ruling blocking the Trump travel ban. Two weeks ago a Washington federal judge who ruled against Trump's first travel ban <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-federal-judge-declines-to-reinstate-injunction-on-trumps-amended-travel-ban.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to extend the injunction on the revised ban. That same week, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-denies-rehearing-of-trumps-original-immigration-order.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a rehearing on Trump's first ban noting that the issue had become moot because the DOJ had withdrawn its appeal on the first ban. The DOJ had <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/doj-requests-hold-on-immigration-order-appeal.php">requested a hold</a> on the appeal proceedings in February but <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-withdraws-appeal-on-previous-immigration-order.php">later withdrew</a> [JURIST reports] it after Trump signed his revised ban.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website], an environmental law advocacy group <a href="/paperchase/Earthjustice%20EPA%20case%20-%20Motion%20for%20Further%20Relief%204-5-17.pdf">filed a motion</a> [PDF] on Wednesday, on behalf of two other environmental groups asking a three-judge panel of the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to order the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] to ban chlorpyrifos - a pesticide widely used for various fruits, vegetables, and wheat grown in the US. The suit comes a week after <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epas-administrator">EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt</a> [official profile] signed an order denying a petition to ban the chemical, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-pruitt-denies-petition-ban-widely-used-pesticide-0">saying </a> [press release] it was necessary to "provide regulatory certainty to the thousands of American farms that rely on chlorpyrifos, while still protecting human health and the environment." The <a href="http://www.panna.org/">Pesticide Action Network</a> (PAN) and <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> (NRDC) [advocacy websites] both argue that the EPA has <a href="http://www.panna.org/press-release/groups-appeal-epa-refusal-ban-major-pesticide-linked-brain-damage-children">ignored research conducted by EPA's own scientists</a> [press release] indicating that chlorpyrifos is harmful to children and farm workers and has been found in unsafe quantities near schools in agricultural areas.</p>

<p>Many environmental other groups have expressed serious concerns over Pruitt's appointment as the new head of the EPA. In February, Pruitt <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/epa-chief-promises-aggressive-rollback-of-obama-regulations.php">vowed </a> [JURIST report] to cut back EPA regulations, saying the agency's Clean Power Plan, Waters of the US rule, and the US Methane rule will all be targets under the Trump administration. Pruitt's nomination for head of the EPA was met with consternation from Democrats, who cited Pruitt's numerous lawsuits against the EPA while he was the Oklahoma Attorney General. Days before his confirmation by the Senate, Pruitt was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/oklahoma-judge-orders-epa-head-to-release-e-mails.php">ordered </a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge to release thousands of emails between the Oklahoma AG office and various fossil fuel companies. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">South Africa Constitutional Court</a> [official website] dismissed the <a href="https://www.environment.gov.za/">Department of Environmental Affairs's</a> (SADEA) [official website] appeal to maintain the moratorium on domestic trade of rhino horn on Wednesday. The moratorium was issued in 2009 under <a href="http://www.gov.za/sites/www.gov.za/files/a10-04.pdf">section 57(2) of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004</a> [text, PDF], which was enacted to protect species and ecosystems in danger. The High Courts of South Africa's Gauteng Division set aside the moratorium in November 2015, which made domestic trade of rhino horn legal again. SADEA's 2015 appeal was dismissed because the Constitutional Court said it lacked "reasonable prospects of success." South Africa's Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa <a href="https://www.environment.gov.za/mediarelease/molewa_notes_constitutionalcourtdecision">issued a statement</a> [text] explaining the restrictions that will remain on rhino horn trade: </p>

<blockquote>In terms of NEMBA a permit is required to among others possess, transport and trade in rhino horns and any derivatives or products of horn. The judgment does not mean that persons are allowed to trade (including selling, donating, or in any way acquiring or disposing of rhino horn) without a permit issued by the relevant provincial conservation department.</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the national restrictions, Rhino horn trade remains illegal internationally, in accordance with the <a href="https://www.cites.org/">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) [official website]. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/threats_to_rhino/poaching_for_rhino_horn">Rhino horn</a> [Save the Rhino backgrounder] is commonly used as medicine in many Asian countries but can also be used to display one's wealth. South Africa is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wildlife-rhinos-safrica-idUSKBN1771VP">home to the majority of the world's rhinos</a> [Reuters report], making rhino horn trade an appealing market to South African poachers. Concerns over the welfare of wildlife and the environment has been mounting in the past several years. In December a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/114/3/528.abstract">scientific study</a> [abstract] published in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> [official website] found that <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/conservation-group-cheetah-populations-and-habitats-are-shrinking.php">cheetah populations</a> throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia are declining as habitats are encroached by various human actors. In November the Indonesia Central Jakarta District Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/indonesia-court-rejects-attempt-to-protect-tropical-forests.php">rejected a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by Acehnese community leaders to protect the Leuser tropical forest from exploitation by mining companies despite conservation groups protests that the forest is home to four endangered species of orangutans, rhinos, elephants and tigers. In October a US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-appeals-court-rules-climate-change-sufficient-evidence-to-list-seals-as-threatened.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that climate change was sufficient evidence to list bearded seals in Alaska as 'threatened' under the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/endangered/esa-library/pdf/ESAall.pdf">Endangered Species Act of 1973</a> [PDF] due to the risk of future loss of habitat. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/">Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0155-judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that parents who remove their children from school during the term may be subject to prosecution. Jon Platt was facing this prosecution after a 7 day trip in 2015 in which he removed his daughter to vacation in Florida. The court was examining if this was a violation of The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/56/section/444">Education Act of 1996 </a> [materials] which looks to ensure that parents make their children regularly attend school. Platt had been subject to a  £120 fine, which he subsequently refused to pay. The court held that having no penalty for truancy is "not an approach to rule-keeping which any educational system can be expected to find acceptable". In a response to try and drive down delinquency rates, the Court sets the precedent that fines are acceptable for any parents whose children miss school.  </p>

<p>Educating youth has been a been a significant government function for many years, yet it is continuously changing throughout the world. JURIST Guest Columnist Erika Wilson examines a new Kentucky law that <a href="/forum/2017/03/Erika-Wilson-Charter-School.php">introduces charter schools</a> [JURIST op-ed] to the Commonwealth for the first time. In March the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that school districts <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-rules-school-districts-must-individualize-education-for-disabled-students.php">must individualize</a> [JURIST report] education for disabled students. This decision afforded protections to a class of students who states were in certain cases ignoring. In March the Supreme Court of Kansas ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/kansas-top-court-rules-state-failed-to-ensure-adequate-education-funding.php">state had failed</a> [JURIST report] ensure sufficient funding for public schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Democrats in the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website]  filibustered the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Nominations.htm">nomination</a> [Senate materials] of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] potential appointee <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-neil-gorsuch/">Neil Gorsuch</a> [SCOTUSblog profile] on Thursday. Republicans countered by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html?_r=0">changing Senate procedure</a> [NYT article] to secure a vote on the nomination. The procedure change, known as the so-called "nuclear option," will allow the Senate to end the debate and force a vote on the nomination with a simple majority. The original procedure required 60 votes.  Out of the 100 seats, Republicans hold 52. This requirement of only a simple majority has the means to change the impartiality of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court nomination has been subject to tumultuous debate since the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016. Earlier this week the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/senate-judiciary-committee-approves-neil-gorsuch.php">voted to endorse</a> [JURIST report] Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court 11-9. Also this week the Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-adds-corporate-liability-appeal-funding-cases-to-docket.php">granted certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in two cases, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-499.htm">Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-499-cert-petition.pdf">cert. peition</a>, PDF] and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-6795.htm">Ayestas v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> (ACCC) [official website] filed suit against <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-takes-action-against-apple-over-alleged-misleading-consumer-guarantee-representations">alleging</a> [press release] that the company made "false, misleading, or deceptive representations" to consumers. The allegations stem from an investigation into reports of devices being disabled after downloading an operating system update. The ACCC claims that the company denied specific devices, which had been previously repaired by third parties, a free remedy. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." The ACCC said it found that Apple had a practice of refusing usual services to devices repaired by third parties. </p>

<p>Apple has been part of numerous recent, high-profile legal proceedings. Last month a Beijing IP Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/chinese-court-rules-for-apple-in-patent-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus did not infringe on patents held by the Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services Co., a Chinese manufacturer which is now "defunct." Earlier that month a Federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/appeals-court-reverses-533m-patent-verdict-against-apple.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a Texas District Court decision awarding Smartflash LLC a $533 million patent verdict against the company. In January the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-vacates-damages-determination-in-samsung-apple-dispute.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its damages determination in the longstanding patent lawsuit between Samsung and Apple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Iowa House approved a <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&ba=SF471">bill</a> [text] Thursday that implements the most strict restrictions on abortion the state has ever had. The bill prohibits all abortions after 20 weeks into the pregnancy and enacts a 72 hour waiting period before any woman can get an abortion. The <a href="http://iowapublicradio.org/post/abortion-ban-approved-after-emotionally-charged-debate#stream/0">debate</a> [IPR report] over the bill extended for over 6 hours. House Republicans were seeking to pass a series of bills that would have banned all abortions, or one that would ban abortions after a heartbeat was detected. The bill does not provide any exceptions, not even for cases that involve health risks or were consummated by incest or rape. This bill will have to be reconciled with <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ga=87&ba=SF%20471">Senate File 471</a> [materials] so then it can be moved towards becoming law. </p>

<p>This bill will join numerous others throughout the United States that attempt to place restrictions on the ability to have abortions. These policies are currently being implemented at all levels of government throughout the country. In March the US Senate passed a joint resolution to allow states to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-votes-to-allow-states-to-withhold-funds-from-abortion-providers.php">prevent federal grant</a> [JURIST report] money from going to abortion providers. In Oklahoma the House of Representatives<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortions-because-of-genetic-abnormalities.php"> approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] which would prohibit abortions because of Down's Syndrome or genetic abnormalities of the child. One portion of the Iowa bill, which imposes a mandatory waiting period, has been struck down by courts in other states. In February the Supreme Court of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">blocked a law</a> [JURIST report] which enforced a mandatory waiting period for abortions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Republic chairman of the Intelligence Committee <a href="http://nunes.house.gov/">Devin Nunes</a> [official profile] <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=775">announced </a> [press release] Thursday that he would temporarily step aside on committee's investigation into possible Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election.The <a href="http://ethics.house.gov/">House Ethics Committee</a> [official website] announced it will be investigating the congressman for disclosing unauthorized classified information which the congressman denies. Nunes will continue working on other cases and has handed responsibility for the Russian investigation over to Representative <a href="https://conaway.house.gov/">Mike Conaway</a> [official profile]. "I will continue to fulfill all my responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims."</p>

<p>Allegations of Russian connections to the Trump administration have come to the forefront of news as President Trump has taken office. In March the U.S. Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-holds-first-hearing-on-russia-involvement-in-election.php">held</a> [JURIST report] its first hearing on Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The same month the FBI director<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php"> confirmed</a> [JURIST report] investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Earlier this month US Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from probes into Russian interference after it was reveal that he had met with Russian <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">officials </a>[JURIST reports] during the campaign. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Osaka, Japan on Wednesday became <a href="http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/contents/wdu020/english/">the first city</a> [official website] in the country to recognize same-sex couples as foster parents. The city government officially certified two men as foster parents of a teenage boy who has been <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/06/national/social-issues/osaka-becomes-first-japanese-city-recognize-sex-couple-foster-parents/#.WOaAxYjyu00">under their care since February</a> [Japan Times report]. The couple first consulted the Osaka City child consultation center in the fall of 2015 about <a href="https://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/osaka-1st-city-in-japan-to-recognize-same-sex-couple-as-foster-parents">adopting the said teenager</a> [Japan Today report]. Following that, they attended lectures, training, and reviews, as well as screenings by the city's social welfare panel and was certified to take charge of a child under 18 on December 22, 2016. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry commented that there was no precedent of this event before. Japan has no legal provision excluding same-sex couples from being foster parents.  </p>

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be a hotly debated issue, both in the US and abroad.  Last December, a legislative committee in the Taiwan Parliament approved a bill that would amend the Taiwan Civil Code to<a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/12/taiwan-parliament-passes-marriage-equality-bill.php"> allow same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. The Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee approved a change in the Code from "male and female parties" into "two parties," which would allow homosexual couples to be legally wed. In September tens of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/09/thousands-march-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-in-mexico.php">thousands of people marched</a> [JURIST report] in Mexico in protest of same-sex marriage, a controversial topic in the country further exacerbated by a proposal from embattled President Enrique Peña Nieto to recognize same-sex marriage. Last March 2015, a Tokyo district assembly became the first municipality in Japan to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/tokyo-district-recognizes-same-sex-partnerships.php">recognize same-sex partnerships</a> [JURIST report]. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/index.php">Russian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] began hearings on Wednesday on a <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170316/278018407.html">request</a> [RAPSI report] to outlaw the Jehovah's Witnesses religious group. The <a href="http://government.ru/en/department/99/events/">Russian Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Russian] has named the group on a list of extremist organizations. The ministry argues that Jehovah's Witnesses' common practice of passing out pamphlets incites hatred against other groups and violates anti-extremist legislation. On Wednesday the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20170405/278171927.html">dismissed</a> [RAPSI report] a countersuit filed by Jehovah's Witnesses against the ministry seeking to declare its actions unlawful and to recognize the members of the organization as victims of political oppression. Three UN human rights experts have <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21479&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN report] Russia to stop the lawsuit, calling it a threat "to individual freedom in general in the Russian Federation."</p>

<p>Russia's human rights and religious freedom record has been the subject of widespread international criticism. In February the Russian Supreme Court annulled the 2.5 year prison sentence of Ildar Dadin, who was the first person to be convicted under a relatively <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-highest-court-releases-political-activist.php">new anti-protest law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in February the European Court of Human Rights ordered Russia to pay more than 63,000 euros <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">for arresting Alexander Navalny multiple times</a> [JURIST report] between March 2012 and February 2014. The court held that Russia repeatedly and unjustifiably violated Navalny's right to freedom of peaceful assembly under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-sanctions-five-russian-officials-for-human-rights-abuses.php">sanctioned</a> [JURIST report] five Russian officials for human rights abuses in association with the death of a lawyer in prison. The Russian Foreign Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/russia-announces-intentions-to-leave-icc.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that Russia would leave the International Criminal Court (ICC), expressing disdain over the ICC's investigation into potential human rights abuses by Russian forces in South Ossetia in 2008. In May 2015 Russian President Vladmir Putin <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/russia-president-signs-restrictive-law-against-undesirable-ngos.php">signed a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows for foreign "undesirable" NGOs or firms to be sanctioned and banned from operating in the country, drawing criticism from human rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://about.twitter.com/company">Twitter, Inc.</a> [corporate website] filed a <a href="/documents/courts/Twitter_v_DHS-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the US government challenging an order to release the identity of the user operating an <a href="https://twitter.com/ALT_uscis">anti-Trump Twitter account</a> (@ALT_uscis) [Twitter profile]. This account describes itself as "immigration resistance" and is openly critical of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">US Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] and the Trump administration, and it is claimed to be operated by employees of the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizen and Immigration Service</a> [official websites] within DHS. In the complaint Twitter asserted, "The rights of free speech afforded Twitter's users and Twitter itself under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution include a right to disseminate such anonymous or pseudonymous political speech." Twitter requests that the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] declare the government's request unlawful under both Twitter's and the user's First Amendment rights. </p>

<p>The use of communication surveillance continues to be a security rights issue in many countries. In January Twitter <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/fbi-request-for-twitter-account-data-may-have-been-legal-overstep.php">released</a> [JURIST report] two warrantless surveillance orders from the Bederal Bureau of Investigation requesting user data that may have overstepped legal guidelines. In January the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/european-commission-proposes-stricter-rules-for-electronic-communication.php">proposed rules</a> [JURIST report] to bolster electronic communications as well as to "create new possibilities to process communication data and reinforce trust and security." The European Court of Justice (ECJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/according-to-the-european-court.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in December that "[g]eneral and indiscriminate retention" of e-mails and other electronic communications by governments is illegal, in a decision that many believe could create an opportunity for challenges to the UK's Investigatory Powers Bill. A federal judge in November <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/judge-rejects-nypd-settlement-of-muslim-surveillance-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the New York Police Department's proposed settlement of a lawsuit accusing the department of improperly surveying the Muslim community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/17a0079p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a preliminary injunction against Ohio's lethal injection process.  The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ohio-execution-idUSKBN17824R">ruled</a> [Reuters, PDF] that the only question before them was whether the lower court abused its discretion in allowing the injunction, which the court of appeals held it did not.  This case is a result of Ohio planning on using a new, three-drug process that have previously caused problems in executions in Ohio and Arizona.  Ohio had halted all executions in 2014 after Dennis McGuire's execution took 25 minutes, where witnesses <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/01/state_executes_murderer_dennis.html">claim</a> [cleveland.com report] he gasped and convulsed for 15 minutes.  The District Court ruled that the three-drug protocol adopted using a paralytic agent and potassium chloride was "completely inconsistent" with the state's position in a previous ruling.  This decision prevents Ohio from executing three death-row inmates due to their inability to use the drugs in their new protocol.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Last week the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/tennessee-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's lethal injection protocols in a unanimous opinion.  In February the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. Also that month a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-delaying-ohio-exeuctions.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction that delays executions in Ohio. In January Judge Michael Merz <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. Also in January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In December a report by the Death Penalty Information Center found that the use of capital punishment in the US is at a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">20-year low</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawyer for the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> said Thursday that the department has "grave concerns" over the <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/sites/mdd/files/ConsentDecree.pdf">Baltimore Police Reform consent decree</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/baltimore-reaches-agreement-with-doj-on-reforming-police-department.php">negotiated</a> [JURIST report] under former President Obama. This took place during a <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/sites/mdd/files/OrderSolicitingComment.pdf">hearing</a> [order, PDF] intended to allow the public to share their thoughts on the settlement.  The <a href="http://law.baltimorecity.gov/">city solicitor</a> [official website] and several Baltimore residents asked the judge to approve the agreement negotiated by the previous administration.  Attorney General Sessions has spoken against backlash and towards law enforcement stating that it hurts the fight against crime.  This comes after Attorney General Sessions issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3535148-Consentdecreebaltimore.html">memo</a> [text, PDF] earlier this week ordering the Justice Department to undertake a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/attorney-general-orders-review-of-police-reform-activities.php">comprehensive review of all police reform activities</a> [JURIST report] issued during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>The consent decree comes after a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-baltimore-police-department-engages-in-discriminatory-practices.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] in August by the DOJ that the BPD had violated the First and Fourth Amendments, as well as other federal anti-discrimination laws with its policing practices. Reform measures are being implemented in police departments across the country primarily as a consequence of increasing reports of excessive force, racial profiling and officer-involved shootings. In July Baltimore's state attorney <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/charges-dropped-against-remaining-officers-in-freddie-gray-case.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against six officers charged with various crimes stemming from the death of Baltimore resident Freddie Gray while he was in police custody. Gray's death started widespread protests in Baltimore and around the nation. In August 2015 Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/maryland-ag-introduces-guidelines-to-limit-profiling-by-police.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to issue new guidelines significantly limiting the use of racial profiling in policing as an effort to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/personnel-appointments/2017-02-14/mr-jean-pierre-lacroix-france-under-secretary-general">Jean-Pierre Lacroix</a> [official profile] described the security situation in Mali as "alarming" <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sc12779.doc.htm">during his first briefing</a> [materials] on Thursday. While acknowledging the progress resulting since the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/Agreement%20on%20Peace%20and%20Reconciliation%20in%20Mali.pdf">Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali</a> [text, PDF] was signed, Lacroix stated that Mali requires continued support from the international community, including potential changes to UN operations in the country, to overcome increased terrorism. Lacroix specifically pointed to the finding that terrorist groups have been integrating under a new alliance created under the Al-Qaeda banner while IS from Iraq and the Levant have also been gaining ground in Mali. Representatives from many countries voiced similar concerns about Mali and agreed with Lacroix that a sanctions regime targeting drug trafficking or those hindering the implementation of the peace agreement could be a viable option in improving the security situation. But Russia's representative warned that stability in Mali cannot be achieved without first resolving the situation in Libya, pointing out that radicals started appearing in Mali only after the destabilization of neighboring Libya. </p>

<p>Last month the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-protection-of-civilians-amid-mali-crisis.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help protect civilians in the northern and central regions of the country amid growing violence and crime sprees. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17582909">Mali crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] began in 2012 after a military coup was stage. The five primary Islamist rebel groups involved in the crisis are Ansar Dine, Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao), al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Signed-in-Blood Battalion and the Islamic Movement for Azawad (IMA). Mujao quickly captured the northern region of Mali, an area known for its drug production. This prompted a French military offensive in January of 2013 to drive the militants out of the region. Another rebel group, known as the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), lent their support to French troops in 2013 and declared the northern region of the country the independent nation of Azawad. The rebel groups <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/malian-rivals-sign-peace-deal-150620173301883.html">signed a peace treaty</a> [Al Jazeera report] with the Malian government in June 2015.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung head Lee Jae-yong on Friday <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170407000675"> denied </a> [<em>Korea Herald</em> report] the bribery charges brought against him in his first court appearance before the <a href="http://seoul.scourt.go.kr/main/new/Main.work"> Seoul Central District Court </a> [official website, in Korean]. Lee was arrested in February and is accused of giving $38.2 million to an adivsor of ousted South korean President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20787271"> Park Geun-hye </a>[BBC backgrounder]. In return for the alleged bribe, prosecutors argue that Park eased regulations, revised relevant corporate laws, and pressured a state agency to back a merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. The merger was supposed to ease the transition of the Samsung leadership from Lee Kun-hee to Lee Jae-yong. Samsung is the largest chaebol (family-run enterprise) in South Korea, and the outcome of Lee's trial <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/08/samsung-trial-begins-as-other-chaebols-watch.html">could have an effect </a> [CNBC report] on the leaders of other chaebols in the country who have been accused of similar crimes.</p>

<p>Lee's trial comes after the impeachment and arrest of former President Park. Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-south-korea-president-arrested.php"> recently arrested </a> [JURIST report] on March 31st on charges of bribery, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking government secrets. Earlier in March, South Korea's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/high-court-upholds-impeachment-of-south-korean-president.php"> upheld </a> [JURIST report] parliament's decision to impeach Park over a scandal related to government bribes paid by Samsung, which are the subject of Lee's current trial. South Korean lawmakers <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-to-impeach-president-park-geun-hye.php"> voted </a> [JURIST report] 234-56 to impeach Park in December. In February, Lee was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/samsung-head-arrested-for-corruption-scandal-involving-south-korea-president.php"> arrested </a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery and undue influence in connection with the scandal. Five Samsung executives <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/samsung-executives-deny-bribery-charges.php"> denied the charges </a>  [JURIST report] of bribery, embezzlement and corruption that were leveled against them in connection with Park. Earlier in February South Korea's special prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/south-korea-indicts-former-culture-minister-top-aide-for-abuse-of-power.php"> indicted </a> [JURIST report] former culture minister Yoon-sun Choo and former presidential chief of staff Ki-choon Kim on charges of coercion, abuse of power and perjury connected to creation of a blacklist of opposition artists critical to Park. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] There are still persistent levels of unethical business conduct around the world as there has been great political change and increased economic uncertainty, stated <a href="http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/assurance/fraud-investigation---dispute-services">Ernst & Young's Fraud Investigation & Dispute Services</a> [corporate website] in their <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_-_EMEIA_Fraud_Survey_2017/$FILE/ey-emeia-fraud-survey-2017.pdf">2017 Fraud Survey</a> [text, PDF] released on Thursday. The survey focuses on Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa. Nearly 1 in 5 respondents would be prepared to act unethically if it would benefit them and 2 in 5 believe their colleagues would also do so. The report states that the current world events line up with the feeling of discontent that comes from the results of the survey this year. "Businesses are operating in an increasingly uncertain world driven by a period of rapid political, regulatory, and economic change. This environment has created new risks for companies as they seek to meet ambitious revenue targets."</p>

<p>There has been an effort to crack down on fraud and unethical business behavior in recent months. In March the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-supreme-court-rejects-jpmorgan-executives-wrongful-identification-claim.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] on Wednesday that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  did not misidentify former JPMorgan official Achilles Macris in its penalty notice in connection with the "London Whale" Scandal. The same month the EU <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-moldova-needs-to-improve-judiciary-and-business-environment.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Moldova needs to do more to encourage an independent judiciary and investigate bank fraud. In February China said it would begin <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/china-promises-to-punish-those-involved-in-illegal-financing-activities.php">imposing harsh punishments </a>[JURIST report] on those involved with illegal financing activities, with a particular focus on underground banking and the stock market, following a string of scandals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cuba <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21488&LangID=E">agreed </a> [press release] on Thursday to a visit from UN Special Rapporteur Maria Grazia Giammarinaro to assess the human trafficking situation in the country. This visit will be the first in ten years by an independent expert of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. According to Giammarinaro, her visit is "an opportunity to meet relevant authorities and key people and groups, to determine the progress made and the challenges Cuba faces in addressing trafficking for sexual and labour exploitation." Her goal in visiting Cuba is to promote prevention of trafficking and to encourage effective measures to protect human rights of trafficking victims. A press conference will take place on April 14 to share her preliminary observations and an official report will be given in June 2018.</p>

<p>Cuba has isolated itself for external interference for a long period. In January, former US President Barack Obama e<a href="/paperchase/2017/01/obama-ends-longstanding-cuban-immigration-policy.php">nded the "wet-foot, dry foot" policy</a> [JURIST report], which automatically allowed Cuban migrants to stay in the US. The Cuban government stated this repeal was an important step in advancing relations between the two countries. Former US President took other steps to stabilize relations with Cuba such as extending <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-secretary-general-extends-condolences-after-fidel-castros-death.php">condolences </a>after Castro's death, <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/us-resumes-diplomatic-relations-with-cuba.php">resuming </a>diplomatic relations, and <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/us-drops-cuba-from-terrorism-list.php">dropping </a> [JURIST reports] it from the national terrorism list. In 2016, former President-elect, now President, Trump <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-secretary-general-extends-condolences-after-fidel-castros-death.php">assured </a> [JURIST report] his administration will &#8220;do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.&#8221; </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <correction num=1>Thai</correction> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38126928">King Maha Vajiralongkorn</a> [BBC profile] signed <a href="http://www.parliament.go.th/ewtcommittee/ewt/draftconstitution2/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=429&filename=index"> a military-backed constitution</a> [PDF, in Thai]  into law on Thursday. The new constitution installs an electoral system for selecting the 500 members of Thailand's parliament. In this system, the Thai people will vote for one of 350 candidates. Those votes are than added together to determine which political parties will gain the remaining 150 seats. The system was adopted in the hopes that it would increase the number of seats held by medium-size parties and prevent government take over by historically large and powerful parties. The constitution also creates an un-elected upper house of parliament comprised of 250 seats. These seats will be filled at the discretion of Thailand's military. The constitution also grants Vajiralongkorn the power to appoint his own regent for when he is out of the country or in times of political crisis. The constitution has been met with numerous <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-south-attacks-idUSKBN17908H">protests</a> [Reuters report] in southern Thailand. </p>

<p>The new constitution comes after <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15641745">a decade of political turbulence</a> [BBC backgrounder] in Thailand. Following the 2006 coup, the Thai people approved a new constitution. By 2008, a democratic general election returned Thailand to civilian rule. However, by September of that year, mass public unrest broke out around the country and the recently elected Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej was forced out of office by Thailand's Constitutional Court. General unrest continued in the country until 2014 when the military staged another coup. The country remained under martial law until 2016, and, in 2016, voters approved the current constitution in a referendum vote. Although the new constitution is in place, election dates have not yet been determined. The constitution is Thailand's 20th since 1932.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><correction num=1>[JURIST]</correction>  The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-compensates-victims-state-sponsored-terrorism">press release</a> [official press release] on Thursday that it paid victims over $800 million from the <a href="http://www.usvsst.com/">U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund</a> [official website].  The money has compensated the survivors and families of victims of the Iranian hostage crisis, the Kenyan bombings, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and other international terrorist events.  Those compensated number in the thousands.  Congress established the fund last May with the money seized from individuals convicted of money laundering and related financial crimes.  In the next few weeks, the amount of money issued in compensation is expected to rise over a billion.  The Justice Department issued the press release in honor of <a href="https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw/">National Crime Victims' Rights Week</a> [official website].  </p>

<p>The criminal justice system has to continually grapple with the rights of victims versus the rights of defendants.  In November voters in several states <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/voters-in-several-states-approve-protections-for-crime-victims.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill offering crime victims similar protections to those accused or convicted of crimes.  In 2014 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/supreme-court-limits-restitution-for-child-porn-victim.php">limited</a> [JURIST report] the amount of restitution that victims of child pornography could receive.  Also in 2014 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-rules-two-california-laws-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a California law extending the time between parole hearings for crimes already committed was unconstitutional.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of the <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/">Ohio Legislature</a> [official website] on Thursday introduced <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-status?id=GA132-SB-128">Senate Bill 128</a> [text, PDF] which would give nuclear power plants in the state credits they could sell because they don't create air pollution. The program is set to last eight periods, that are each two years long. In order to qualify for the credits, it must be shown that if the plant closed, fine particulate levels, carbon dioxide emissions, and carbon monoxide levels would be negatively impacted. The bill also requires that the employment at facilities that receive the credits remain similar to the levels of those that were constructed before 1990.</p>

<p>Ohio is one of several states who have been considering or introducing legislation to give nuclear power plants Zero-Emission Credits (ZECs) as a method of giving nuclear power plants credit for their carbon free electricity generation. Connecticut's legislature is currently considering <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&bill_num=SB-106">SB 106</a> [Text and status] which would grant ZECs to the nuclear power plants in that state. New Jersey's legislature is currently considering bill <a href="https://legiscan.com/NJ/text/S3061/2016">S-3061</a> [Text] which would require a study to be conducted to consider the feasibility of enacting ZECs. Illinois's governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/illinois-governor-signs-sweeping-energy-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill in December that granted ZECs to some of the nuclear power plants in that state.  In August New York Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-establishment-clean-energy-standard-mandates-50-percent-renewables">announced</a> [press release] the establishment of the Clean Energy Standard. The standard provides assistance to upstate New York nuclear power plants to prevent their closure while also requiring that 50 percent of New York's electricity will come from renewable energy by 2030. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prosecutors at the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] in The Hague, Netherlands called on judges to hold South Africa accountable for failing to arrest Sudanese <a href="http://sudan.gov.sd/index.php/en">President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir</a> [government website] when he visited the country in 2015. Two arrest <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2009_01514.PDF">warrants</a> [text, PDF; <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2010_04826.PDF">second warrant</a>, PDF] have been issued for Al-Bashir involving <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/darfur/albashir/pages/alleged-crimes.aspx">numerous charges</a> [materials] including "crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of genocide." Dire Tladi, a law professor and legal representative for South Africa, <a href="http://councilandcourt.org/files/2012/11/Tladi-AU-and-ICC.pdf">said</a> [article, PDF] that arresting Al-Bashir would be "inconsistent with the pursuit of peace" in Sudan. He further states the country's position that they are not obligated by international law or the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] to arrest a "non-state-party" such as Al-Bashir, A South African <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/num_act/iotrsoticca2002699.pdf">law grants immunity</a>  [text, PDF] to sitting heads of state who visit the country, according Tladi. This grant of immunity contradicts provisions in the Rome Statute, and the ICC must hold South African officials responsible to carry out the councils "most basic function," according to ICC prosecutor <a href="http://www.theadvocacyclub.com/?q=node/16">Julian Nicholls</a> [official profile]. </p>

<p>There has been significant criticism of the Sudanese government and the conflict in the Darfur region . Since 2003 the region has faced civil unrest from conflict between the government and rebel groups. In February, UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan Aristide Nononsi <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-sudan-government-to-protect-civilians-in-darfur.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the Sudanese government to protect civilian rights in Darfur. In January the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and international sanctions Idriss Jazairy <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-praises-us-decision-to-lift-sanctions-on-sudan.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] former US president Barack Obama's recent decision to lift all US sanctions on Sudan. In September Amnesty International reported that the Sudanese government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/ai-sudan-government-used-chemical-weapons-against-civilians.php">used</a> [JURIST report] chemical weapons on civilians in a region of Darfur between January and September 9 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neil M. Gorsuch has been <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00111">confirmed in a 54-45 vote</a> [materials] by the Senate as the 113th justice of the US Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/judges/judge-neil-m-gorsuch">judge</a> [official profile] on the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [government website] in Colorado before becoming President Donald Trump's <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-nominates-neil-gorsuch-to-supreme-court.php">nominee</a> [JURIST report] to fill the seat left vacant following the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-justice-antonin-scalia-has-died.php">death of Antonin Scalia</a>. Gorsuch <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_04-07-17">will be sworn in</a> [press release] at a private ceremony in the Justice's Conference Room of the Supreme Court at 9 a.m. on Monday. A public Oath Ceremony will take place at the White House later in the day. The vote to confirm Gorsuch was nearly split along party lines. Ultimately, three Democrats voted for Gorsuch: <a href="http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/">Joe Manchin</a>, <a href="https://www.donnelly.senate.gov/">Joe Donnelly</a>, and <a href="https://www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/">Heidi Heitkamp</a> [official websites]. Georgia Republican <a href="https://www.isakson.senate.gov/public/">Johnny Isakson</a> did not vote.</p>

<p>Gorsuch's confirmation caps a contentious battle between Democrats and Republicans over the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Scalia's death in February 2016, then-President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans <a href="/forum/2016/10/why-the-supreme-court-is-not-a-key-issue-in-the-presidential-election-and-why-it-should-be.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST commentary] Garland, insisting that the next president should chose the nominee. Following Trump's election to the White House and Republican retention of control over the Senate, nomination of a conservative judge appeared likely. Trump fostered intrigue over his nomination by releasing a <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-supreme-court-nominees-233115">list of 21 potential nominees</a> [<em>Politico</em> report] before ultimately selecting Gorsuch. Despite a Republican majority in the Senate, Gorsuch's confirmation was not unchallenged. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had to invoke the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html">"nuclear option"</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] to bypass a filibuster by Democrats, which reduced the number of votes needed to invoke cloture from 60 to 50. The move was necessary because the 52 Republican members of the Senate would not have the votes to defeat the filibuster without Democratic support. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan on Friday called for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] to consult Congress on potential further action following a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/06/statement-president-trump-syria">military strike</a> [WH press release] on Syria. While <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/327827-ryan-appropriate-for-trump-to-consult-congress-on-next-steps-in-syria">Ryan says</a> [The Hill report] that it was within the President's to authorize the launch, he further stated that now is the appropriate time "for the administration to consult with Congress as it considers next steps to resolve the long-running crisis in Syria." Article I, Section 8 of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">U.S. Constitution</a> [LII backgrounder] grants the Congress the power to declare war. The President <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/war_powers">derives the power to direct the military</a> [LII backgrounder] after a Congressional declaration of war from Article II, Section II, naming the President as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/syria-1/">The war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact, particularly in the war-torn region of Aleppo. In February, according to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">HRW</a> [advocacy site], the Syrian government <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo. The same month, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">more than 13,000 prisoners were hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at Saydnaya prison. Last Wednesday, The UN Security Council conducted emergency talks on Wednesday regarding an alleged chemical attack in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">Syria that killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. Following that on Thursday evening, the U.S. military attacked <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/us-military-has-launched-more-50-than-missiles-aimed-at-syria-nbc-news.html">Syria-government airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles</a> [CNBC News]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/">The United Nations Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] has expressed alarm at the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2017/4/58e792134/6000-flee-fresh-south-sudan-violence-uganda.html">deteriorating condition of South Sudan's security </a> [official report] in light of the recent attacks carried out in the the town of Pajok. UNHCR said that homes have been looted by roving militia and the elderly and disabled who could not flee from the conflict were shot dead as ongoing fighting is also reported in the districts of Magwi and Oboo, which are close to the Ugandan border. It also reported Uganda has faced an influx of 6,000 refugees form South Sudan since just earlier this week, and more than 4,000 more South Sudanese are waiting at the Ugandan border for asylum. Uganda is now the main host of the world's fastest growing refugee crisis because of the conflict roiling in South Sudan. According to Auma Lucy Yubuan, who escaped the fighting and was able to talk to UNHCR,<br />
<blockquote>The soldiers were looting, breaking doors and beating people. They would arrest you and ask you to show them where the rebels are. But when you tell them you don&#8217;t know, they beat you. They killed people. I am so happy even though I have nothing to eat and I have lost everything, my children are alive. I was so scared I didn&#8217;t know if I would see them again. The bullets were flying everywhere and you couldn&#8217;t move, you had to lie on your belly. I am very grateful I am alive.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a> has spent much of its brief history as a nation in civil war. Last month, the Chair of the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-in-south-sudan.php">UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said</a> [JURIST report] that there is a need to establish courts and bring prosecutions against those who have committed rights abuses throughout the nation's conflicts. In January the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-hundreds-raped-killed-in-south-sudan-by-military-groups-in-violent-july.php">UN Mission in South Sudan reported</a> [JURIST report] that a violent period in July 2016 left hundreds of civilians dead. In December the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-security-council-decides-against-arms-embargo-for-south-sudan.php">UN Security Council failed</a> [JURIST report] to pass an arms embargo against South Sudan. Two weeks earlier a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-south-sudan-teetering-on-brink-of-disaster.php">UN spokesperson warned</a> [JURIST report] that South Sudan "teeters on the brink of disaster." The <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-commission-ethnic-cleansing-underway-in-south-sudan.php">UN also said</a> [JURIST report] in December that ethnic cleansing was occurring in South Sudan. In September the UN announced, and South Sudan accepted, an <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/south-sudan-agrees-to-additional-un-peacekeeping-forces.php">increase in UN peacekeeping forces</a> [JURIST report] in the nation from 14,000 to 18,000 in an attempt to stop civilian killings, sexual assaults, <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-south-sudan-government-forces-committing-widespread-violations.php">and destruction of both public and private property</a> [JURIST reports]. South Sudan was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">officially recognized</a> [JURIST report] as an independent nation in July 2011.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.tunisie.gov.tn/index.php?option=com_serviceslinks&task=view&Itemid=61&id=546&profil_id=7">Tunisian Court</a> [official website] sentenced British DJ <a href="http://eartoground.co.uk/artist-profile/daxj">Dax J</a> [professional profile] to a year in prison on Thursday for public indecency and offending public morality <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/british-dj-sentenced-year-tunisian-jail-playing-muslim-call-to-prayer">after the artist played</a> [guardian report] a remix of the Muslim call to prayer in a nightclub. The nightclub was subsequently shut down and charges were filed against the club's owner and the organizer of the event where Dax J was playing - these charges were subsequently dropped and the prosecution appealed the dropped charges claiming the owner and organizer still maintain liability. Tunisia&#8217;s religious affairs ministry commented on the charges and conviction and said: "Mocking the opinions and religious principles of Tunisians is absolutely unacceptable."</p>

<p>Free speech has often come under fire throughout the world and many nations and legislations have attempted to curb it through social media monitoring and public safety legislation. In January, the Jordanian government arrested eight activists and charged them with "insulting the King" and "incitement to spread chaos to undermine the political regime of Jordan using social media." Earlier that month, <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/hrw-saudi-arabia-has-arrested-two-human-rights-advocates-this-year.php">Human Rights Watch criticized</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia for their detainment of rights advocates often through vague provisions, such as "sowing discord" and "inciting public opinion," in the nation's 2007 cybercrime law. In August of last year the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-cybersecurity-law.php">National Assembly of Pakistan approved</a> [JURIST report] the controversial Electronic Crimes Bill 2015. The law has received negative attention in the past from human rights activists for the role it could play in hindering the free speech and privacy of Pakistani citizens. Last March, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-condemns-saudi-of-5-years-for-tweets.php">Amnesty International expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the cyber-crime conviction of five-years incarceration of a journalist in Saudi Arabia for posts created under this private Twitter account; some of of the tweets exhibited support for women's rights, human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://supremecourt.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/apps-courts-epub/public/viewOpinion?docId=N00005299PUB">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF download] a lower court decision overruling the state of Nebraska's long-time ban on same sex partner foster parenting. In doing so, the court compared the ban to signs reading "'whites only' on the hiring office door." The 1995 ban was first challenged in this case in 2013, brought by three same-sex couples along with several interest groups. The trial court had <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/order_granting_plaintiffs_motion_for_sj_2015.08.05.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the parents, and the state appealed. On the state supreme court ruling, <a href="https://www.aclunebraska.org/en">ACLU of Nebraska</a> [official website] Executive Director Danielle Conrad said, "this is a victory for children and LGBT Nebraskans. There are tens of thousands of LGBT people who call the Cornhusker State home and thousands of Nebraska children in need of a foster care placement." </p>

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be a hotly debated issue, both in the US and abroad. On the same day as the Nebraska decision, the City of Osaka, Japan became the first city in the country to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/osaka-first-city-in-japan-to-recognize-same-sex-foster-parents.php">recognize same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report] as foster parents. Last December, a legislative committee in the Taiwan Parliament approved a bill that would amend the Taiwan Civil Code to <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/taiwan-parliament-passes-marriage-equality-bill.php">allow same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. The Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee approved a change in the Code from "male and female parties" into "two parties," which would allow homosexual couples to be legally wed. In September tens of thousands of people <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thousands-march-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-in-mexico.php">marched</a> [JURIST report] in Mexico in protest of same-sex marriage, a controversial topic in the country further exacerbated by a proposal from embattled President Enrique Peña Nieto to recognize same-sex marriage.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">US Department of Labor</a> (DOL) [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/07/google-pay-disparities-women-labor-department-lawsuit">accused</a> [Guardian report] <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/">Google</a> [corporate website] of engaging in compensation discrimination against female employees. As part of an ongoing investigation, DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper stated, "we found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce." Google denied the allegation, and the investigation will continue. These allegations came during a hearing in an ongoing <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20170104">lawsuit</a> [press release] <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/newsroom/newsreleases/OFCCP20162406_0.pdf">filed</a> [complaint, PDF]  by the DOL against Google in January arising out of an audit for federal law compliance review.</p>

<p>Just last month the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-google-e-mail-scanning-settlement.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a settlement in a class action lawsuit between non-Gmail users and Google based on an allegation that Google illegally scanned the e-mails of non-Gmail users in their correspondence with Gmail users for targeted advertising purposes. In January, the DOL <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/labor-department-sues-oracle-for-employment-discrimination.php">filed a lawsuit</a> JURIST report] against Oracle America, Inc. alleging the leading technology company has a systemic practice of paying Caucasian male workers more than their counterparts in the same job title. The <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/secret-service-settles-discrimination-lawsuit-with-black-agents.php">Secret Service</a> [JURIST report] has also faced employment discrimination allegations and in January agreed to a $24 million settlement with 10 black agents who accused the agency of racial discrimination in a 2000 federal lawsuit</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the United States' missile launch in Syria earlier this week in response to a chemical weapons attack, United Nations (UN) <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary-General Antonio Guterres</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2017-04-07/secretary-generals-statement-syria">called for restraint</a> [statement] in handling the situation in Syria. Calling the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons "abhorrent," Guterres emphasized the need for accountability but said <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56524#.WOkgrdLys2w">any resolution must be done within existing international law</a> [UN News report] so as to avoid "deepen[ing] the suffering of the Syrian people." This statement comes after the US launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat Airbase in response to the Assad regime's alleged use of chemical weapons in the Idlib region. Amidst increasing military action, the result of which is a crumbling of Syria's ceasefire agreement from December 2016, Guterres expressed his belief that there is "no other way to solve the conflict than through a political solution." Syrian military officials called the US missile launch a blatant act of aggression.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">The war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact, particularly in the war-torn region of Aleppo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Venezuelan government announced on Saturday that opposition leader <a href="https://twitter.com/hcapriles">Henrique Capriles</a> [Twitter profile] has been banned from holding office for 15 years by the Venezuelan state comptroller. The ban, which was <a href="http://www.voanews.com/a/key-venezuela-opposition-figure-barred-from-office/3801498.html">imposed</a> [VOA report] for alleged "administrative irregularities" during his time as the governor of Miranda and misuse of donations from the British and Polish embassies, would bar Capriles from opposing current President <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolasmaduro">Nicolas Maduro</a> [Twitter profile] in the upcoming presidential election. In addition to the alleged misconduct during his time as governor of Miranda, Capriles has also been accused by Venezuelan officials of inciting violence during protests against President Maduro. The ban continues a trend of targeting political dissidents in Venezuela. In response to this ban, thousands of Venezuelans <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39542181">protested</a> [BBC report] in Caracas after an already week-long protest against the government.</p>

<p>Venezuela has been in the throes of political unrest since the December 2015 election. In November the National Assembly postponed a symbolic trial of in an <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/venezuela-national-assembly-suspends-trial-against-president.php">effort to ease political tension in the nation</a> [JURIST report]. In October the National Assembly voted to open <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">criminal impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">Assembly also declared</a> [JURIST report] that there is a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. In June government officials asked the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/venezuela-officials-ask-top-court-to-block-referendum-to-remove-president.php">Supreme Court to deny a referendum</a> [JURIST report] to remove Maduro proposed by opposition leaders. In April Venezuela's <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">opposition-led parliament approved</a> [JURIST report] new referendum rules. In March the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that the Venezuelan national assembly may not review the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/nikki-haley-20939217">Nikki Haley</a> [profile] told CNN in an interview set to air Sunday that removing <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad </a> [Al Jazeera profile] from power in Syria is one of the top priorities of Donald Trump's administration. Haley said that it was hard to see a peaceful and stable Syria with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/09/middleeast/syria-missile-strike-chemical-attack-aftermath/">Assad as president</a> [CNN report], based on his action and the current situation in Syria. The sentiment was supported by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who on Sunday said in an <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-09/syria-regime-change-trump-administration-priority-un-haley-says/8428976">interview with ABC news</a> [ABC report], that once the threat of ISIS had been reduced, the US would focus on stabilizing the situation in Syria. The comments from the Trump administration signal a new course in the foreign policy regarding Syria. A week ago, Haley and Tillerson said that the US was not working towards unseating Assad, and that such a decision should be up to the Syrian people. The change in direction comes in response to reports that Assad used chemical weapons against civilians, which President Trump said had crossed a line with him. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">The war in Syria </a>[JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact, particularly in the war-torn region of Aleppo. In February, according to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">carried out</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ss.one.un.org/resident-coordinator">Eugene Owusu</a> [profile], the top United Nations humanitarian official in South Sudan, <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/SS_170408_PressRelease_HC_calls_on_parties_to_halt_attacks.pdf">called on the government and opposition</a> [report, PDF] of South Sudan on Saturday, to ensure the protection of civilians and aid workers in the country. The plea comes after a week that saw both armed opposition forces and state security officials detain and beat up aid workers. Reports also suggested the government forces had attacked a town, killing several dozen people, forcing more than 6,000 people to flee to Uganda and forcing others to hide in the bushes around the town. Owusu called the actions "reprehensible and unacceptable" and called on both sides to stop targeting innocent parties immediately. The <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs </a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56528#.WOo1RmdFfIW">estimates that</a> [UN report] more than 3.5 million people have been forced out of their homes, 1.7 million of which have fled to the neighbouring countries. At the moment, an estimated average of 2,000 refugees from South Sudan is arriving in Uganda every day, the majority of which are children. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan </a>[JURIST feature], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">officially recognized</a> [JURIST report] as an independent nation in July 2011, has spent much of its brief history as a nation in civil war. On Friday, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us">United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a> [official website] expressed alarm at the deteriorating condition of South Sudan's security, as both governmental and opposition forces have been attacking civilians. In March, the Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-in-south-sudan.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that there is a need to establish courts and bring prosecutions against those who have committed rights abuses throughout the nation's conflicts. In December, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-security-council-decides-against-arms-embargo-for-south-sudan.php">voted against</a> a weapons embargo on South Sudan. In September the UN announced, and South Sudan accepted, an increase in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/south-sudan-agrees-to-additional-un-peacekeeping-forces.php">UN peacekeeping forces </a>[JURIST report] in the nation from 14,000 to 18,000 in an attempt to stop civilian killings, sexual assaults, and destruction of both public and private property. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile] will not renew the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ncfs">National Commission on Forensic Science</a> (NCFS) [official website], according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956146/download">statement</a> [press release] released Monday. The NCFS is a 30-member group of scientists, academics, law enforcement officials, prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges originally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-and-national-institute-standards-and-technology-announce-launch-national">commissioned</a> [press release] in 2013 by the Department of Justice (DOJ) during President Obama's administration. The commission is set to expire April 23, and continued efforts to "advance forensic science and combat violent crime" will be handled by the Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, a committee <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/09/presidential-executive-order-task-force-crime-reduction-and-public">established</a> [press release] by executive order under President Trump. Sessions commended the efforts of the NCFS in his statement. <br />
<blockquote>As we decide how to move forward, we bear in mind that the Department is just one piece of the larger criminal justice system and that the vast majority of forensic science is practiced by state and local forensic laboratories and is used by state and local prosecutors. We applaud the professionalism of the National Commission on Forensic Science and look forward to building on the contributions it has made in this crucial field.</blockquote>The DOJ will seek public comment through the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/">Federal Register</a> [government website] on how it should move forward with forensic science issues. The deadline to comment is scheduled for June 9. </p>

<p>Trump has been very proactive signing executive orders at the start of his term as president, with many orders targeting crime. In February Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-new-executive-orders-targeting-drugs-and-crime-reduction.php">signed</a> three executive orders aimed at targeting drug cartels, and creating the Task Force to reduce crime and stopping crimes against law enforcement.  In January, the president signed an <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-to-cut-federal-regulations.php">order</a> [JURIST report] aimed at reducing the number of federal regulations. Also in his first weeks of office Trump signed orders <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-withdrawing-from-trans-pacific-partnership.php">withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-order-blocking-us-funding-to-foreign-ngos-that-provide-or-promote-abortions.php">preventing foreign non-governmental organizations supporting abortions from receiving US funding</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/donald-trump-issues-executive-orders-on-immigration.php">withholding federal funding</a> [JURIST reports] for so-called "sanctuary cities."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Numerous African and international nongovernmental organizations <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/10/zambia-support-international-criminal-court">urged</a> [HRW report] Zambia to reaffirm its membership in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Monday. The calls come in response to the <a href="https://www.au.int">African Union's</a> (AU) [official website] decision to adopt an <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/african-union-leaders-back-leaving-icc.php">"ICC withdrawal strategy"</a> [JURIST report] back in February.  Zambia, as  a member  of the <a href="http://www.sadc.int">Southern Africa Development Community</a> (SADC) [official website], was a vocal party during the weeks of negotiations which lead to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] and was one of the first nations to sign and later ratify the document. If Zambia is to reaffirm its membership, it would join 14 other African nations who have reaffirmed their membership after the AU's announcement. </p>

<p>The African Union and the ICC have had a tumultuous relationship over the course of the past year. In July an advisory board to the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/au-advisory-board-accuses-icc-of-bias-against-african-nations.php">African Union accused ICC of narrowly focusing</a> [JURIST report] its investigations on African government leaders since its inception in 2002. The <a href="http://pages.au.int/ecosocc">Economic Social and Cultural Council </a>(ECOSOCC) recommended that AU members should quit the ICC should lawmakers follow through with a proposed amendment allowing the prosecution and arrest of African heads of state. Opponents of the recommendation have voiced concerns that quitting the ICC would increase the risk of human rights violations. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] also stated that giving African leaders immunity would <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/11/16/icc-defend-core-principles">defeat the purpose of the ICC's creation</a> [press release]. Later in February, Gambia <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/gambia-president-country-will-remain-in-icc.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would remain in the ICC. Also in February a South African court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/south-africa-court-denies-governments-bid-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">struck down a proposal to leave the ICC</a> resulting in the South African government's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/south-africa-cancels-withdrawal-from-icc.php">decision to cancel</a> [JURIST reports] its withdrawal in March. Following the AU's announcement, many countries, including Botswana, Burkina Faso, Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Lesotho, Mali, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Tunisia have affirmed their membership to the ICC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The attacks <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/09/523170444/church-explosion-in-egypt-leaves-at-least-21-dead-dozens-injured">killed at least 44 people</a> [NPR report] and injured 100 others after suicide bombers in two different cities tried to enter the churches while services were underway. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">The Islamic State</a> [BBC backgrounder] claimed responsibility for both attacks. In a televised address, President el-Sisi <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39548645">announced</a> [BBC report] his intention to declare a state of emergency for the next three months during which more soldiers will be deployed to protect public buildings, police will be ale to arrest civilians without laying charges, authorities will be able to search homes without warrants, large gatherings will be banned, and there will be tighter censorship. The new measures must be approved by the Egyptian parliament before being implemented.</p>

<p>The threat to Christians in the Middle East has heightened in past years as radical extremists have increasingly targeted attacks on this religious group. In February 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the beheading of Coptic Christians in Libya by IS, characterizing the acts as "vile crime[s] targeting people on the basis of their religion." The Egyptian Christians were abducted in two separate incidents, and a released video showed members of IS beheading the captives on a beach in Libya. Earlier that month, Egypt's state-run <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/index.php/en/">National Council for Human Rights</a> (NCHR) [official website] publicly condemned recent violent attacks against the nation's Coptic Christians. Islamist extremists are believed to be behind <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/meast/egypt-church-attacks/index.html">attacks</a> [CNN report] such as the burning of churches and property owned by Christians, along with the displacement of Christian citizens. Coptic Christians comprise roughly 10 percent of the country's 85 million people and more than 275 people were killed and 2,000 injured in the course of the attacks. These citizens have become a scapegoat for the ousting of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Egyptian ex-president Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile], and recent attacks are widely seen as retaliation from Morsi supporters, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">the Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The anti-corruption group <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/">Global Witness</a> (GW) [advocacy website]<br />
 <a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/oil-gas-and-mining/shell-knew/">said</a> [press release] Monday that recently leaked emails reveal that <a href="http://www.shell.com/">Shell</a> [corporate website] knowingly briber Nigerian officials so the company could access a Nigerian offshore oilfield. GW alleges Shell and its Italian business parter Eni paid $1.1 billion to the Nigerian government, knowing that the money would go to former oil Minister Dan Etete for personal use instead of to the Nigerian people.  Etete was previously convicted of money laundering.  The emails also implicated Nigerian then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12192152">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] in receiving a part of the funds.  GW referred to the bribery as "one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of the oil sector."  Shell has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eni-nigeria-idUSKBN17C12L">denied</a> [Reuters report] any illegal conduct.  </p>

<p>In January a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/uk-court-nigeria-citizens-cannot-sue-shell-for-oil-spill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Nigerian citizens could not sue Shell in the UK for an oil spill.  In December 2015 a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/dutch-court-nigeria-farmers-can-sue-shell-in-netherlands.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Nigerian citizens could sue in the Netherlands for the spill.  In November the same year Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-royal-dutch-shell-failed-to-clean-nigeria-oil-spill-sites.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Shell had failed to clean the oil spill sites.  In November 2014 Amnesty <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/amnesty-shell-made-false-claims-about-impact-of-oil-spills.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Shell had made false claims about the impact of a Nigerian oil spill.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Pakistani military court on Monday sentenced <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav-the-hindu-explains/article17907888.ece">Kulbushan Jadhav</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> backgrounder], an Indian naval officer who was detained in Pakistan for the past year, to death. The court <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amnesty-international-on-kulbushan-jadhav-pakistan-military-court-violates-international-standards/articleshow/58113616.cms">handed down</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] the death sentence after finding Jadhav guilty of espionage and sabotage. The sentence was subsequently approved by Pakistan's army chief <a href="https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-chiefs&dept=coas">General Qamar Javed Bajwa</a> [official profile]. The Indian government has responded by saying that the execution of Jadhav would amount to the "premeditated murder" of an Indian national by the Pakistani government. Jadhav was tried under the controversial <a href="http://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw1-apaUY2Fqa-ap%2BYaQ%3D%3D-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj">Pakistan Army Act</a> [text] and <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/en/law/Offences/3.pdf">Official Secrets Act</a> [text, PDF], which have been criticized for providing very little transparency into military courts.</p>

<p>Pakistan's nine military courts were established in January of last year after Taliban militants attacked children in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30505448">Peshawar school massacre</a> [BBC archive; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/h/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-savage-extremism-of-taliban-insurgents.php">report</a>], killing 134 students and 19 adults. Military power was subsequently expanded, giving military courts jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism despite the country's civilian government. Critics argue that the new procedures defer too much power to the military. Allegations of torture and judicial abuse were widespread during the reign of previous Pakistani military courts. However, many Pakistanis support the military courts due to the crumbling civilian system. Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December 2014 in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] that month, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, in March of last year the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row are <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">minors</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-neil-gorsuch/">Judge Neil Gorsuch</a> [SCOTUSblog profile] was <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/pressreleases/pr_04-07-17">sworn in</a> [press release] Monday, becoming the 113th person to serve on the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Gorsuch's confirmation will return the court to a balance of four conservatives, four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy as the swing vote. In accepting the post, Gorsuch <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/neil-gorsuch-sworn-supreme-court-justice/story?id=46699857">stated</a> [ABC report], "To my new colleagues and the staff of the Supreme Court, thank you for the very warm welcome. I look forward to many happy years together." Kennedy administered the oath of office to Gorsuch using the family Bible while his wife and two daughters watched. Gorsuch was a judge on the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] in Denver. He graduated from Harvard Law and holds a PhD from Oxford, where he was a Marshall scholar.</p>

<p>Gorsuch's confirmation ends a contentious battle between Democrats and Republicans over the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Scalia's death in February 2016, then-President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans <a href="/forum/2016/10/why-the-supreme-court-is-not-a-key-issue-in-the-presidential-election-and-why-it-should-be.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST commentary] Garland, insisting that the next president should chose the nominee. Following Trump's election to the White House and Republican retention of control over the Senate, the nomination of a conservative judge appeared likely. Trump fostered intrigue over his nomination by releasing a list of <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-supreme-court-nominees-233115">21 potential nominees</a> [Politico report] before ultimately selecting Gorsuch. Despite a Republican majority in the Senate, Gorsuch's confirmation was not unchallenged. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had to invoke the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html">"nuclear option"</a> [NYT report] to bypass a filibuster by Democrats, which reduced the number of votes needed to invoke cloture from 60 to 50. The move was necessary because the 52 Republican members of the Senate would not have the votes to defeat the filibuster without Democratic support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York became the first state to offer free college tuition to residents on Monday when governor Andrew Cuomo approved the <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/Reports/WAM/20170313/2017_budget_summary.pdf">2018 State Budget</a> [text, PDF]. The budget, unanimously <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s2001/amendment/original">passed</a> [materials] by the Senate, invests $163 million in the <a href="https://www.ny.gov/programs/tuition-free-degree-program-excelsior-scholarship">Excelsior Scholarship</a> [government website] program, making tuition free for middle class and low-income students attending 2 and 4-year <a href="https://www.suny.edu/">SUNY</a> and <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/">CUNY</a> [official websites] colleges. Cuomo said he hopes other states will adopt similar programs. <blockquote>By making college at our world-class public universities tuition-free, we have established a national model for access to higher education, and achieved another New York first.</blockquote>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. In September, the Kentucky Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kentucky-top-court-rules-governor-cannot-cut-state-university-budgets.php">ruled</a> that Governor Matt Bevin did not have the authority to unilaterally cut the budget for state universities. In 2015 the Supreme Court of Washington <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. In August 2015 the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill </a>[JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-court-upholds-regulations-on-loans-at-for-profit-college-loans.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July of 2015 in favor of tight regulations pointed at the for-profit college industry. The court ruled that the Education Department has the right to demand that schools show that their graduates are financially dependent enough to repay their student loans. In August 2014 a judge for a Travis County Civil Court in Texas <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/texas-judge-rules-education-budget-cuts-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Texas legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty to provide for Texas public schools because the school finance system is structured, operated, and funded so that it cannot provide a constitutionally reasonable education for all Texas schoolchildren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)</a> [official website] said in a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2017/4/58eb7e454/unhcr-urges-suspension-transfers-asylum-seekers-hungary-under-dublin.html">press release</a> [text] on Monday that all transfers of asylum-seekers from other EU states to Hungary should be suspended under the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R0604">Dublin Regulation</a> [text].  The Dublin Regulation is how the EU determines which state should review an asylum-seeker's application.  High Commissioner <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/the-high-commissioner.html">Filippo Grandi</a> [official profile] said<blockquote>Given the worsening situation of asylum-seekers in Hungary, I urge States to suspend any Dublin transfer of asylum-seekers to this country until the Hungarian authorities bring their practices and policies in line with European and international law.</blockquote> Some of these policies include detaining asylum-seekers, including children, in "shipping containers" at the Hungarian border. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations have emerged as significant humanitarian issues around the world, including the European Union, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations.  In March UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-experts-disapprove-of-eu-migrant-return-procedure.php">disapproved</a> [JURIST report] of the EU migrant return procedure. In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-expresses-concern-over-hungarys-proposed-migration-amendments.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over a proposed Hungary migration amendment.  Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/austria-threatens-lawsuit-against-hungary-over-migrant-acceptance.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in September that Austria will take Hungary to the International Court of Justice if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alabama Governor Robert Bentley on Monday afternoon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z38yid5-eK0">resigned</a> [statement, video] from his office after impeachment proceedings were initiated against him by lawmakers that morning. Bentley was under investigation for misuse of state resources to pursue and cover up an affair with one of his former staff members, Rebekah Caldwell. Bentley has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alabama-governor-idUSKBN17A0UI">pleaded guilty</a> [Reuters report] to two misdemeanor charges, failing to file a major campaign finance report and converting campaign money for personal use. Leading up to the impeachment proceedings, the <a href="http://ethics.alabama.gov/"> Alabama Ethics Commission </a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://ethics.alabama.gov/docs/bentley/Bentley_Press_Release_April_2017.pdf"> press release </a> [text, PDF] revealing that they had probable cause to believe that Bentley had violated the <a href="http://ethics.alabama.gov/docs/2016_DRAFT_CODFICATION_Restated_AL_Ethics_Act_2016_Revisions(8-1-2016).pdf"> Alabama Ethics Act </a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2013/title-17/chapter-5"> Fair Campaign Practices Act </a> [text]. Later in that same week, the<a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/ISD/HseCommittee.aspx?OID_ORGANIZATION=1795&COMMITTEE=Judiciary"> Alabama House Judiciary Committee </a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oanow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/c1/9c10fc22-1bd5-11e7-8d6d-53cbf2068460/58e7fef1935de.pdf.pdf"> report </a> [text, PDF] from their impeachment investigation of Bentley, finding that he had directed law enforcement to advance his personal interests and subjected career law enforcement officers to tasks intended to protect his reputation.</p>

<p>Bentley's impeachment and resignation is the latest governmental ethics problem for Alabama. In October, Alabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/alabama-top-justice-suspended-over-gay-marriage-order.php"> suspended </a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/judiciary/judiciary.cfm"> Court of the Judiciary </a> [official website] for violating judicial ethics by ordering state probate judges to ignore a federal court order requiring them to grant marriage licenses to homosexual couples. Justice Roy Moore was initially <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-chief-justice-facing-suspension-over-same-sex-marriage-order.php"> suspended </a> [JURIST report] in May after being charged with violating ethical rules. The Judicial Inquiry Commission (JIC) <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/311766160/Roy-Moore-COJ-Complaint"> accused </a> [complaint, PDF] Moore of failing to act impartially and refusing to follow the law when he <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/294755454/Administrative-order"> ordered </a> [text, PDF] probate judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php"> not to issue same-sex marriage licenses </a> [JURIST report] as their issuance ran contrary to Alabama law. The commission stated that Moore is bound by the Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution and has violated the law. Soon after being suspended, Moore filed suit in federal court challenging the JIC's rule that any judge under investigation must be suspended. In August, the court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/08/alabama-supreme-court-justices-suit-against-judicial-inquiry-commission-dismissed.php"> dismissed </a> [JURIST report] Moore's complaint, finding that it was not the federal court's place to intervene in issues of state constitutional law.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Several US advocacy groups filed a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10024259/2017.04.10-WH-Visitor-Logs-FOIA-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday to obtain visitor logs for who has met with President Trump at the White House, the Mar-a-Lago Florida resort and Trump Tower in New York. <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a>, <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/">National Security Archive</a> [advocacy websites] and the Knight First Amendment Institute initiated the suit in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. These plaintiffs previously requested the logs under the <a href="https://www.foia.gov/about.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [government backgrounder], but have sued because their requests have gone unanswered by the Secret Service. &#8220;This is a case about the public&#8217;s right to know who wields influence over the most powerful office in our government,&#8221; <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/crew-others-sue-white-house-visitor-logs/">stated</a> [press release] Knight&#8217;s Alex Abdo.  &#8220;In our view, the Freedom of Information Act requires the government to make this information available to the public.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Trump administration has faced repeated lawsuits under the FOIA in recent months. Last month the Knight First Amendment Institute <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/first-amendment-attorneys-sue-trump-over-data-obtained-in-border-crossings.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against the Trump administration seeking release of data under the FOIA on how often US citizens and others had electronic devices searched at border crossings. In January a journalist and a graduate student at MIT <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/lawsuit-seeks-information-on-ag-nominee-jeff-sessions.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against eight federal agencies for records on attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, alleging the agencies improperly refused to process their FOIA requests and denied them rights to appeal. Also in January the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/aclu-seeks-trump-records-in-connection-with-potential-conflicts-of-interests.php">filed a request</a> [JURIST report] under the FOIA for "records pertaining to financial and other ethical conflicts of interest in connection with the presidential transition of President-Elect Donald J. Trump."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearings began in Spain on Monday regarding potential war crimes committed by President Bashar al-Assad's regime in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-14703995">Syria</a> [BBC backgrounder].  The case is a <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article143696914.html">result</a> [AP report] of a Spanish national's brother being abducted and tortured in Damascus before being executed in 2013. The family claims that the brother was not part of an opposition group and just a truck driver making a delivery. The family was able to identify the body after a forensic photographer smuggled the photos out of Syria. The photographer may testify in the case next month. The investigation involved nine of Assad's closest aides but not Assad himself due to his immunity. Spain is the first to hold a criminal investigation of potential war crimes into Syria, as Russia has blocked referral of the Assad regime to the International Criminal Court.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a significant impact, particularly in the region of Aleppo. On Wednesday, The UN Security Council met for emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. In February, according to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">carried out</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hungary's president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17382823">Janos Ader</a> [BBC profile] on Monday signed legislation requiring foreign universities in Hungary to also have campuses their home country. This is an issue for schools like <a href="https://www.ceu.edu/">Central European University</a> (CEU) [university website], which has a campus in Hungary but nowhere else, even though it states that the university has a dual US-Hungary identity. The school, financed by the Hungarian-born campaigner for "open society" George Soros, may have to move out of the country. The legislation is criticized for allegedly <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2017/04/hungary-prez-signs-law-that-may-oust-soros-college/">targeting foreign universities</a> [Reuters report] in Hungary as a part of <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister">Prime Minister Viktor Orban's</a> [official website] campaign pledge to protect national interests against "foreign meddling in Hungarian affairs."  Opponents of the legislation say that the government is forcing out important education centers in Hungary. The government has argued that it is not forcing out or closing down any schools bur rather ensuring that all schools are governed by the same set of rules without privileges. </p>

<p>The Hungarian National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hungary-passes-law-banning-foreign-school.php">passed the law</a> [JURIST report] early this month. The legislation requires that CEU open a campus in the US by February 15, 2018 to remain in Hungary. There have been concerns in the past over Prime Minister Orban's views on nationalism. At the beginning of Orbán's term, Hungary adopted a new constitution called the <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/e/02/00000/The%20New%20Fundamental%20Law%20of%20Hungary.pdf">Fundamental Law</a> [text, pdf], which has been criticized for neglecting international human rights standards and fast-tracking political procedures in a manner that jeopardizes the country's separation of powers. Furthermore, there has been concern over the administration's human rights views with the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/rights-group-urges-eu-to-address-hungarys-attack-on-human-rights.php">International Federation for Human Rights</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php">Human Rights Watch</a> [JURIST reports] addressing Hungary's laws and practices regarding human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-actions-dismantle-kelihos-botnet-0">announced </a> [press release] that it had effectively disrupted the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956506/download">Kelihos botnet</a> [complaint, PDF], a network of thousands of virus ridden computers used to glean personal information and login credentials by distributing malicious software through spam emails. <blockquote>Once infected by Kelihos, compromised computers within the botnet are used by the Defendant to generate huge volumes of unsolicited "spam" emails that advertise counterfeit drugs, pump-and-dump stock schemes, work-at-home scams, and other frauds. Kelihos is also used to generate phishing emails, harvest user credentials, and to download additional malware onto victim computers, including ransomware and banking Trojans.</blockquote>A DOJ spokesman said the agency will continue "combatting cybercrime, no matter the size or sophistication of the scheme, and punish those who are engaged in such crimes."</p>

<p>Last week Peter Yuryevich Levashov, long thought to be the creator of the Kelihos botnet, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-botnet-idUSKBN17C2B4">arrested </a> [Reuters report] in Spain on charges purportedly related to US claims that Russia interfered with the November 2016 US election. Two weeks ago the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-holds-first-hearing-on-russia-involvement-in-election.php">held hearings</a> [JURIST report] on seeking to determine the level of Russian involvement in the election, one week after the director of the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed </a> [JURIST report] it had begun investigating Russian interference. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-charges-russian-officers-for-hacking-email-accounts.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] indictments for four Russian hackers in March related to an email hacking incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Judge Nelva G. Ramos <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-txsd-2_13-cv-00193/pdf/USCOURTS-txsd-2_13-cv-00193-11.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that a controversial Texas <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB14">voter ID law</a> [materials] was passed in part with discriminatory intent. The plaintiffs <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-texas-idUSKBN17D059">argued</a> [Reuters report] that the law burdened minority voters who are more likely to not carry identification. They say such a burden was intended by Texas Republicans to suppress voters who tend to favor Democrats. While the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] held that there was sufficient evidence to prove discriminatory intent, the court nevertheless remanded the case to reexamine such evidence. Ramos found that the drafters implemented unduly strict terms with an awareness of the law's likely disproportionate impact. Ramos further stated that the law's strict terms do not justify Texas's stated purpose-to combat voter fraud. While the ruling may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/us/federal-judge-strikes-down-texas-voter-id-law.html">effectively strike down the law</a> [NYT report], Texas officials have suggested the state's plan to file an appeal.  </p>

<p>Since being signed into law in 2011 by former governor Rick Perry, the law has been a contentious issue for the Texas legislature, citizens and judiciary. In February the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice </a>(DOJ) [official website] introduced a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/doj-reverses-position-in-texas-voter-id-law-claim.php">withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the case, and abruptly reversed its original stance that the bill was created with discriminatory intent. In January the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">declined to hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] involving the law. In September a federal judge ordered Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-judge-orders-texas-to-revise-voter-id-education-materials.php">revise its voter ID materials</a> [JURIST report], as it had been found to not comply with an order to relax the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cfr.org/international-organizations-and-alliances/group-seven-g7/p32957">Group of Seven</a> (G7) [backgrounder] nations failed to reach an agreement on whether to impose new sanctions on Russia and Syria, Italian foreign minister Angelino Alfano announced Tuesday. Before the two-day meeting of the G7 ministers, British Foreign Secretary <a href="http://www.boris-johnson.com/">Boris Johnson</a> [official website] had stated that he <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39565700">wanted to impose</a> [BBC report] new sanctions in the wake of the alleged chemical weapons attack. The G7 met to solidify a unified approach to the Syrian situation before US Secretary of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/267393.htm">Rex Tillerson</a> [official profile] visits Moscow next week. However, the G7 meeting reached no such unified plan.</p>

<p>Last week, the UN Security Council conducted emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. The next evening, the US military <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/us-military-has-launched-more-50-than-missiles-aimed-at-syria-nbc-news.html">attacked</a> [CNBC report] a Syria-government airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles. Following the US missile launch, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-sg-restraint-necessary-to-avoid-escalation-in-syria.php">restraint</a> [JURIST report] in handling the situation in Syria. Also last week, US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/speaker-calls-on-trump-to-consult-congress-following-syria-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] President Donald Trump to consult Congress on potential further action following a military strike on Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Legislators in Maryland on Monday withdrew a <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb0835&stab=01&pid=billpage&tab=subject3&ys=2017RS">bill</a> [SB 835, PDF] proposing to make Maryland a so-called "sanctuary state." The purpose of the bill was to "prohibiting a specified government agent from taking specified actions for immigration enforcement purposes." The bill would have prevented law enforcement from "stopping, arresting, searching, or detaining an individual for purposes of investigating a suspected immigration violation or inquiring about specified matters" and would have required a specific model of conduct to be developed and implemented for such procedures. The bill had been<a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/10/maryland-sanctuary-state-bill-pulled/"> threatened</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] with a veto from the governor and harshly criticized by the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Immigration has been a key focus for Trump since his inauguration. Last month the city of Seattle <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/seattle-sues-trump-over-sanctuary-cities-executive-order.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] against President Donald Trump's administration, arguing that their designation as a "sanctuary city" should not prevent them from receiving federal funds, as required by<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united"> Executive Order 13768</a> [text]. US Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-threatens-to-cut-funding-sanctuary-cities-that-refuse-to-enforce-immigration-laws.php">reiterated </a>[JURIST report] that "sanctuary cities" may soon see federal funds from the Department of Justice cut off. In January, seven days after his inauguration, Trump <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13769.php">issued an executive order </a>[JURIST text] which limited migration from seven Muslim-majority countries, among other changes. That order was repeatedly challenged, causing Trump to craft a new order of slightly smaller scope. The new order <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php">was challenged</a> [JURIST report] two weeks ago by five states claiming that the revised order will still "cause severe and immediate harms."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Jeff Sessions </a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-announces-department-justice-s-renewed-commitment-criminal">announced</a> [press release] his office has mandated immigration enforcement as a priority. In order to limit the number of undocumented immigrants in the country, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> [official website] sent a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/956841/download">memo</a> [text, PDF] to all federal prosecutors instructing them to prosecute harboring and reentry cases as felonies instead of misdemeanors for repeat offenders. Furthermore, the order requires the designation of border security coordinators to ensure enforcement and track the amount of cases prosecuted. The memo also instructs felony charges for those who enter into a marriage to prevent deportation.<blockquote>It is a high priority of the Department of Justice to establish lawfulness in our immigration system. While dramatic progress has been made at the border in recent months,much remains to be done. It is critical that our work focus on criminal cases that will further reduce illegality. Consistent and vigorous enforcement of key laws will disrupt organizations and deter unlawful conduct. I ask that you increase your efforts in this area making the following immigration offenses higher priorities.</blockquote>Sessions also announced a plan to hire over 175 immigration judges to  combat the backlog in immigration courts. </p>

<p>The focus on immigration policies continues to be a growing legal issue.  JURIST Guest Columnist Ali Khan <a href="/forum/2017/04/deportation-as-a-crime-against-humanity.php">discussed</a> [JURIST backgrounder]  the potential deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US as a crime against humanity. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesman <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/dhs-ends-plan-to-separate-women-and-children-at-us-border.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration was no longer planning to separate women and children at the US' southern border as a means of deterring immigration. The state of Massachusetts] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/massachusetts-challenges-states-role-in-immigration-detention.php">requested </a> [JURIST report] the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court  find that state authorities lack jurisdiction to detain illegal immigrants. The California State Senate  overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/california-passes-bill-to-prohibit-state-police-from-enforcing-immigration-laws.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] on last Monday that would expand protections for undocumented immigrants by prohibiting state or local law enforcement from using resources to investigate, detain, report or arrest people for immigration violations</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://hunconcourt.hu/az-alkotmanybirosag-szervezete">Constitutional Court of Hungary</a> [official website] repealed a village ban on the construction of mosques as well as headscarves like burkas and chadors worn by Muslim women on Wednesday. The village of Asotthalom, located on the Serbian boarder, implemented implemented the law in November. The village also outlawed muezzins, men who call Muslims to prayer from the minaret of a mosque. In its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/04/12/world/europe/ap-eu-hungary-mosque-ban.html">ruling</a> [AP report] the court said the bans were aimed to limit freedoms of religion and speech. Village leaders said the ordinance was linked to the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union's</a> [official website] plan to resettle asylum-seekers and to maintain the villages "community and traditions." Prior to Hungary building walls along their boarders with Serbia and Croatia, the village of Asotthalom was used as an entry point to Western Europe for refugees. </p>

<p>Full-coverage veils have been the recent subject of legislation and adjudication in Europe. In February Bavaria <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/bavaria-approves-partial-ban-on-full-face-veil.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on full-face veils in certain public spaces. Later that month the <a href="http://www.msb.gov.tr/">Turkish Ministry of Defense</a> [official website, in Turkish] announced that female soldiers will be allowed to wear headscarves along with their uniforms. In December German Chancellor Angela Merkel on <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/germany-chancellor-endorses-partial-ban-on-full-face-veils.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] a partial ban on burqas and niqabs, saying that "the full facial veil is inappropriate and should be banned wherever is legally possible." Also in December the Netherlands legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/Netherlands-legislature-votes-in-favor-of-partial-burka-ban.php">voted in favor </a>[JURIST report] of a partial burka ban. However, in July the EU's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/eu-court-backs-french-woman-dismissed-for-wearing-head-scarf.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a French woman who was fired for wearing a head scarf.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/death-sentences-and-executions-2016?page=show">released</a> [press release] its annual <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/death_penalty_2016_report_embargoed.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on global use of the death penalty Tuesday, saying China continues to use the punishment more than any other country. The group says the exact number of executions committed in China in 2016 cannot be known for certain because China labels information related to executions as a state secret. AI estimates that the total number of executions in China were in the thousands for 2016. Iran is second in the world, committing at least 567 executions in 2016. Not including data from China, there were at least 1,032 executions throughout the world in 2016, which is over 600 executions less than 2015. The number of people sentenced to death in 2016, however, was 3,117, which is an increase of more than 1,000 compared to 2015. The United States fell out of the top five list for the first time since 2006. A total of 20 executions occurred in the US in 2016, nine of which occurred in Georgia and seven occurred in Texas. Thirty-two people were given death sentences in 2016 in the US, resulting in a total of 2,832 people being on death row in the country.</p>

<p>The use of the <a href="/forum/2017/03/Valena-Beety-death-penalty.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST op-ed] within the United States has been a highly contested punishment. In March, Florida <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a law which required a unanimous recommendation from the jury in order to impose a death sentence.  Earlier in March, the <a href="https://courts.arkansas.gov/courts/supreme-court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-supreme-court-allows-planned-executions-to-go-forward.php">order</a> [JURIST report] stating there is no stay in place preventing the execution of eight inmates schedule for next month. In February the Mississippi house approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. Also in February a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio refused to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-delaying-ohio-exeuctions.php">lift</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction that delays executions in Ohio. In January Judge Michael Merz <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. Also in January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Hawaii, in a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's travel ban, <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-5fd3-da80-afdf-dfff1b5d0002">requested</a> [motion, PDF] on Tuesday that the entire <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] sit for review of the case. Hawaii is requesting the <em>en banc</em> hearing for the appeal, arguing that this is a "question of exceptional importance." The state also referred to a similar case on the immigration executive orders which is currently pending in the Fourth Circuit. That court granted an <em>en banc</em> hearing on Monday. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear an appeal of its ruling on May 15. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.doj.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced late last month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/justice-department-appeals-court-injunction-on-travel-ban.php">file an appeal</a> after a Hawaii judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">granted</a> [JURIST reports] the state's request to convert the temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban into a preliminary injunction. The court ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-expedites-review-of-trump-travel-ban.php">expedited schedule</a> [JURIST report] for the appeal of a lower court ruling blocking the Trump travel ban. In March a Washington federal judge who ruled against Trump's first travel ban <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-federal-judge-declines-to-reinstate-injunction-on-trumps-amended-travel-ban.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to extend the injunction on the revised ban. The DOJ had requested a hold on the appeal proceedings for the first ban in February but later <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-federal-judge-declines-to-reinstate-injunction-on-trumps-amended-travel-ban.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] it after Trump signed his revised ban.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Union vice president <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/timmermans_en">Frans Timmermans</a> [official profile] announced on Wednesday that a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-966_en.htm">legal assessment</a> [press release] will be launched "as soon as possible" regarding Hungary's recently enacted Higher Education Law. Opponents argue the law is meant to close the Central European University (CEU), and may violate European Union free movement of services and freedom of establishment requirements. A spokesman for the Hungarian government has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/eu-launches-probe-in-hungarian-education-law/2017/04/12/f6ea276e-1f6c-11e7-bb59-a74ccaf1d02f_story.html?utm_term=.d0f3454f571b">stated</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] that the investigation is in retaliation for Hungary's anti-migrant positions. The CEU was founded by George Soros, who Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has previously accused of trying to "illegitimately influence his government." Timmermans said next steps regarding legal concerns with the law will be considered at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Hungary has been the target of several investigations in recent years. The International Federation for Human Rights had <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/rights-group-urges-eu-to-address-hungarys-attack-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the EU in November to better address Hungary's sustained attack on human rights. In February 2015, Human Rights Watch had <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the EU for not taking action against Hungary's laws and practices relating to human rights. In 2013 the Hungarian government enacted constitutional <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hungary-to-propose-further-constitutional-amendments.php">amendments</a> [JURIST report] after receiving criticism over its 2012 amendments. The amendments contained new rules on the recognition of religious groups, as well as modifications to the bans on political advertisements on commercial television and radio stations. The changes allowed political campaign advertisements on commercial TV and radio, but broadcasters would not be allowed to charge for them. Political parties were also be given equal air time. The Hungarian Justice Minister stated that the amendments were proposed as the result of pressure due to the harsh criticism Hungary received. HRW and other human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hungary-constitution-changes-do-not-go-far-enough-hrw.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the changes as "largely cosmetic," highlighting a lack of resolve over issues surrounding weakened human rights protections in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/04/11/not-it-justice/how-californias-pretrial-detention-and-bail-system-unfairly">report</a> [text] on Tuesday saying California's bail system pressures the poor into pleading guilty in order to be released from jail. The group said tens of thousands of Californians have been held for days to months <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/11/us-california-bail-system-penalizes-poor">without a conviction</a> [press release]. It also said California's median bail rates are five times that of the rest of the country and many incur debt in order to pay the bondman's fee. HRW called on California to change its pretrial detention system to one that only impose bail on those who pose a serious threat to society. The system should favor "release and assesses the risk of danger in an individualized, contextual way."</p>

<p>The issue of finances as a factor for revocation or imprisonment is a contested issue. Earlier this month the Supreme Court of Missouri <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/missouri-supreme-court-rules-parolees-ability-to-pay-court-costs-must-be-considered.php">ruled</a> [JURSIT report] that a parolee's ability to pay court costs should be considered. The Maryland Court of Appeals <a href="paperchase/2017/02/maryland-top-court-defendants-cannot-be-held-before-trial-if-unable-to-afford-bail.php">adopted a rule</a> [JURIST report] in February ending the practice of holding criminal defendants in jail before trial when they cannot afford bail. Last June A lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/lawsuit-accuses-louisiana-judge-of-running-debtors-prison.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana judge of running a modern-day debtors' prison for sentencing people to jail when they could not afford fees. Last March The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/aclu-settles-debtors-prison-lawsuit-with-biloxi.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, in a lawsuit alleging that the detention of defendants unable to pay fines for misdemeanor charges exhibited deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights. Also last March The US Department of Justice (DOJ) u<a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">rged</a> [JURIST report] state court systems to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The list of those <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-probes-idUSKBN17D2KB">under investigation</a> [Reuters report] consists of high-ranking officials in key political positions. Citizens in Brazil have erupted in protest due to the alleged political corruption conspiracy. The investigation threatens President <a href="http://www2.planalto.gov.br/vice-presidencia/vice-presidente/biografia-antiga/bio-en">Michel Temer</a> [official profile] efforts to pass reforms directing at strengthen investor confidence and rebuilding the economy. According to Senator<a href="http://www.thedialogue.org/experts/jorge-viana/"> Jorge Viana</a [official profile], who himself is under investigation, the investigation will cause "the political crisis [to] deepen and [will] risk an institutional paralysis because the entire Brazilian political system is under question."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK Court of Appeal <a href="https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/news/noel-conway-appeal-assisted-dying/">ruled</a> [advocacy press release] on Wednesday that terminally ill Noel Conway can proceed with challenge of the country's law against assisted dying. Noel Conway, a retired college lecturer, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 and is not expected to live more than 12 months. In March, a panel of High Court judges rejected his motion to change a blanket ban on providing a person assistance to die. Conway <a href="https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/news/noel-conway-seeks-change-law/">argues </a> [press release] that the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/9-10/60">Suicide Act 1961</a> [text] is incompatible with <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/7">Article 8 </a> [text] of the Human Rights Act, which dictates respect for private law, and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/12">Article 14</a> [text] of the Human Rights Act, which provides protection from discrimination. <a href="http://www.carenotkilling.org.uk/">Care Not Killing Alliance</a> [official website], an organization that opposes assisted "suicide" or euthanasia, stated that <a href="http://www.carenotkilling.org.uk/news/why-no-to-assisted-suicide/">changing the law</a> would <a href="www.carenotkilling.org.uk/press-releases/judicial-review-denied/">pressure </a> [press releases] vulnerable people to end their lives out of fear of being emotional and financially burdensome. His case will now proceed to the High Court for decision on the legality of the law.</p>

<p>The right to die is a contentious issue worldwide. In January French lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/france-parliament-approves-bill-allowing-sedation-for-terminally-ill-patients.php">approved </a>[JURIST report] a bill that will allow physicians to keep terminally ill patients sedated until death, opting not to extend the bill to cover physician-assisted suicide. In December the Court of Appeals of Quebec <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/quebec-top-court-upholds-physician-assisted-death-law.php">overturned </a>[JURIST report] a lower court injunction and ruled that Quebec's physician-assisted death law is not in conflict with any elements of the Quebec Criminal Code. In November German lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/germany-lawmakers-approve-assisted-suicide-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing assisted suicide for "altruistic motives" but banning the practice in cases where it is being conducted on a "business" basis. The month before California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-governor-signs-right-to-die-bill-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that provides terminally ill patients the right to die. Last May a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/dutch-court-clears-man-who-assisted-in-dying-mothers-suicide.php">cleared </a>[JURIST report] a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother in committing suicide. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of detainees at the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detention-facility/tacoma-northwest-detention-center">Northwest Detention Center</a> (NWDC) [official website] in Tacoma, Washington <a href="http://www.nwdcresistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/April10HungerStrikePressRelease.pdf">began a hunger strike on Monday</a> [NWDC Resistance press release]. According to <a href="http://www.nwdcresistance.org/">NWDC Resistance</a> [advocacy website], an advocacy group for undocumented immigrants, prior to the beginning of the hunger strike a demand letter was circulated through the facility that <a href="http://www.nwdcresistance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Transcript-of-April-10-hunger-striker-letter.pdf">included demands</a> [text, PDF] for more expedited hearings, improved quality of food, improved access to medical care, and lowering of exorbitant commissary prices. The facility has been the object of protests and hunger strikes before. In 2014 a hunger strike involving more than 1,000 people started at the NWDC and spread to other facilities throughout the US for more than 55 days.  </p>

<p>Immigration, deportation, and the detention of immigrants has been a matter of national controversy for years and has been a particular focus of US President Donald Trump. The issue has culminated in <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-denies-rehearing-of-trumps-original-immigration-order.php">lawsuits challenging</a> [JURIST report] Trump's controversial executive orders affecting migrants. Last month, the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) released a report finding that a significant portion of federal law enforcement resources were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-report-federal-law-enforcement-resources-concentrated-on-immigration-arrests.php">directed to immigration-related offenses</a> [JURIST report]. The analysis showed that half of all federal arrests in 2014 were related to immigration, with 61 percent of them occurring in five districts along US-Mexico border. In January, seven days after his inauguration, Trump issued an immigration-related executive order, which limited migration from seven Muslim-majority countries, among other changes. A lower court order blocking enforcement of that <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds-stay-blocking-trump-immigration-order.php">order was upheld</a> [JURIST report] in February by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. An amended executive order, issued in early March, was also blocked by district courts in <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-in-hawaii-maryland-temporarily-block-trumps-travel-ban.php">Hawaii and Maryland</a> [JURIST report]. Additional challenges to the revised policy are pending, including one brought by <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php">Washington and joined</a> [JURIST report] by California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon. These policies have been criticized as part of a larger overhaul of the country's approach to immigration undertaken by the new administration, <a href="/forum/2017/02/trumps-immigration-order-signals-sharp-departure-from-other-post-wwii-presidents.php">largely departing</a> [JURIST op-ed] from the policies of other post-WWII presidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zambian opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema was arrested Wednesday on treason charges for allegedly obstructing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14112922">President Edgar Lungu's</a> [BBC profile] motorcade.  <a href="http://www.zambiapolice.gov.zm/">Police</a> [official website] raided Hichilema's house and questioned him after he blocked the president's motorcade on Saturday.  Hichilema has been <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/upnd-leader-hakainde-hichilema-charged-treason-170412173802546.html">defeated in two previous presidential elections</a> [Aljazeera report] and claims that the last election was rigged.  The police have stated Hichilema disobeyed police orders thereby putting the president <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN17E1C3-OZATP?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">in danger</a> [Reuters report].  Hichilema has been charged with a non-bailable offense but the <a href="http://www.hrc.org.zm/">Zambian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website] has stated that it hopes Hichilema will be treated fairly and brought before the court of law without unreasonable delay.</p>

<p>Zambia's presidency has been surrounded by controversy in recent years. In September the Zambia <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/zambia-high-court-rejects-attempt-to-stop-presidential-inauguration.php">Supreme Court denied an application by UPND</a> to stop the inauguration of Lungu after <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/zambia-presidential-candidate-accuses-incumbent-of-electoral-fraud.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2013 Zambian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zambia-authorities-arrest-former-president.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former president Rupiah Banda on allegations that he misappropriated over USD $11 million during his three-year tenure in office. Zambia's Supreme Court in 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/zambia-high-court-acquits-ex-presidents-wife-on-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Regina Chiluba, the wife of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba, of charges that she accepted stolen property during the years of her husband's administration. Prior to his wife's acquittal, former president Chiluba was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/zambia-ex-president-acquitted-of.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 of charges of stealing money from the country's treasury while in office from 1991-2001. He was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/former-zambia-president-to-stand-trial.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the corruption charges in February 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/16-1137P-01A.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that the Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe has exercised sufficient governmental power to meet the requirements of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29">Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</a> (IGRA) [text], which would make their settlement lands subject to federal instead of state laws. Massachusetts <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2017/04/11/appeals-court-reverses-ruling-blocking-tribes-marthas-vineyard-casino-bid">argued</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] that 500 acres of land on Martha's Vineyard belonging to the tribe were prohibited from engaging in gambling. A lower court ruled that the tribe was subject to state and local gambling bans because it did not exercise sufficient governmental power to be covered by the IGRA. The appellate decision overturns that lower court ruling, opening the door for the Aquinnah tribe to conduct limited gambling on Martha's Vineyard. </p>

<p>Tribal matters have been of increasing concern over the past year in federal courts. In March the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians has a federally <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-rules-native-american-tribe-has-federally-established-rights-in-groundwater.php">established right to groundwater</a> [JURIST report] in the Coachella Valley reservation in California. Earlier that month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-allows-dakota-access-pipeline-construction-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against Native American tribes seeking to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In January the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-acquittal-refunds-tribal-immunity.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe bars individual-capacity damages actions tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-rules-for-native-americans-in-voting-rights-case.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of Native American tribes claiming that Nevada's voting procedure violated the Voting Rights Act by failing to have polling placed on certain Native American reservations. In September the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/obama-administration-settles-lawsuits-with-native-american-tribes.php">settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] for over $492 million accusing the government of mismanaging natural resources and other tribal assets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="www.parliament.gov.eg/">Parliament of Egypt</a> [official website] on Tuesday gave its <a href="http://www.nile.eg/%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88">unanimous approval</a> [press release] to a three-month state of emergency <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-president-announces-state-of-emergency-after-terror-attacks.php">put in place</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile]. Announced by Egypt's <a href="http://www.nile.eg/">state-run news</a> [Nile News, in Arabic], the state of emergency was instituted in response to two deadly Christian church bombings in the Egyptian cities Tanta and Alexandria. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> [BBC backgrounder] took credit for the bombings, prompting this state of emergency, explained as a means to allow the Egyptian government to respond quickly to threats. </p>

<p>The threat to Christians in the Middle East has heightened in past years as radical extremists have increasingly targeted attacks on this religious group. In February 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the beheading of Coptic Christians in Libya by IS, characterizing the acts as "vile crime[s] targeting people on the basis of their religion." The Egyptian Christians were abducted in two separate incidents, and a released video showed members of IS beheading the captives on a beach in Libya. Earlier that month, Egypt's state-run <a href="http://www.nchregypt.org/index.php/en/">National Council for Human Rights</a> (NCHR) [official website] publicly condemned recent violent attacks against the nation's Coptic Christians. Islamist extremists are believed to be behind <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/meast/egypt-church-attacks/index.html">attacks</a> [CNN report] such as the burning of churches and property owned by Christians, along with the displacement of Christian citizens. Coptic Christians comprise roughly 10 percent of the country's 85 million people and more than 275 people were killed and 2,000 injured in the course of the attacks. These citizens have become a scapegoat for the ousting of Egyptian ex-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile], and recent attacks are widely seen as retaliation from Morsi supporters, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56554#.WO7fsVPyvVo">vetoed</a> [UN press release] a <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">United Nations Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] resolution on Wednesday that would have condemned Syrian president <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">Bashar al-Assad</a>'s [official website] use of neurologic gas against the Syrian town Khan Sheikhoun on April 4. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-un-vote-idUSKBN17E2LK">gas attack</a> [Reuters report] prompted a responsive bombing by the United States against a Syrian airbase, increasing the rift between the US and Russia. Now, Russia has vetoed a resolution backed by the US, France and Britain to force al-Assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident. This was the eighth time Russia has acted in Syria's favor on the UNSC. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a significant impact, particularly in the region of Aleppo. <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/spain-court-begins-hearings-on-syria-war-crimes.php">Hearings began</a> [JURIST report] in Spain earlier this week regarding potential war crimes committed by President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. The case is a result of a Spanish national's brother being abducted and tortured in Damascus before being executed in 2013. Also earlier this week, the UNSC met for emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. In February, according to Human Rights Watch, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">carried out</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/international/borderlands_and_boundary_waters/pdfs/Center_and_Grijalva_v_Kelly_complaint_2017_04_12.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday targeting the construction of the US-Mexico border wall proposed by US President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile]. The group argues that the wall is in violation of environmental laws and urges federal agencies to conduct in-depth investigations into the environmental implications of the wall. The Center's executive director, <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/about/staff/">Kierán Suckling</a> [professional profile] <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2017/border-wall-04-12-2017.php">expressed concern</a> [press release] that the wall would "divide and destroy the incredible communities and wild landscapes along the border," including people's homes, endangered species such as jaguars and Mexican gray wolves, and protected federal lands. The Center said its ultimate goal is to require the Trump administration to undertake a comprehensive review of the social, economic and environmental costs of the border wall.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements">executive order</a> [text] signed by Trump in January, titled "Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements," directed the construction of a wall along the US-Mexican border and to increase the number of enforcement officials to remove undocumented immigrants. This <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/donald-trump-issues-executive-orders-on-immigration.php">order was one of the first</a> [JURIST report] in the Trump Administration's efforts to fulfill his controversial immigration policy. Significant concerns have been expressed concerning the construction of the wall on financial, environmental, and human rights grounds. This lawsuit is largely a response to such concerns. In February <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">US Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/secretary">Secretary John Kelly</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-releases-immigration-enforcement-measures.php">issued a memorandum</a> [JURIST report] ordering the immediate identification and allocation of sources of available funding for the construction of the border wall. In March, a front-runner for the 2018 Mexico Presidential election, <a href="http://www.amlo.org.mx/">Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mexico-presidential-hopeful-files-complaint-against-trumps-border-wall.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website] against the proposed border wall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Russian businessman<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/alisher-usmanov/"> Alisher Usmanov</a> [Forbes backgrounder] filed a slander lawsuit Wednesday against Kremlin critic <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045">Alexei Navalny</a> [BBC backgrounder] in Moscow's Lyublinksy district court, according to court documents and the court press secretary. In a <a href="http://tass.com/politics/941111">statement</a> [TASS report], court service secretary said, "Usmanov's slander lawsuit against Navalny has been indeed filed with the Lyublinsky court. The court will decide on initiating the proceedings within 5 days." The lawsuit stems from Navalny and his non-profit organization, the <a href="https://fbk.info/english/about/">Anti-Corruption Foundation</a> [official website], accusing Usmanov of bribing the Russian prime minister through the SotsGosProyekt Foundation.</p>

<p>Navalny has been a focal point of Russia's legal system and news as he is one of the<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2664720a-1ec9-11e7-b7d3-163f5a7f229c"> leading voices</a> [Financial Times report] against Putin's regime. In March Navalny was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/russian-opposition-jailed-for-resisting-police-orders-during-protest.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] at a demonstration protesting the alleged corruption of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. In February he was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-opposition-leader-convicted-and-sentenced-for-embezzlement.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for embezzlement. That same month, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Russia to pay more than €63,000 for arresting Navalny multiple times between March 2012 and February 2014. In May a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/russia-court-rejects-plea-to-imprison-opposition-activist-navalny.php">declined </a>[JURIST report] authorities' request to convert Navalny's suspended sentence into a prison term. He had been convicted of fraud and sentenced to three-and-a-half-years suspended sentence. In 2015 Navalny was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/russian-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-15-days-in-prison.php">handed</a> [JURIST report] a 15-day prison sentence for distributing leaflets attempting to publicize an "anti-crisis" demonstration. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-172660">unanimously held</a> [decision] that Russia violated European human rights laws when it raided a terrorist-held school in the Russian town of Beslan in 2004, leading to the death of more than 330 civilian hostages. More than 180 children were killed in the attack. Russia contended in the suit that it should not be blamed for the admittedly tragic results, arguing the burden of compensation should not be placed on governments that react to terrorist attacks. The court held that Russia's authorities had specific information linked to a planned attack in the area, and failed to take reasonable preventive measures to protect schools. Further, authorities <a href="/paperchase/Tagayeva%20and%20Others%20v%20Russia%20press%20release.pdf">refused to give families</a> [press release] of the victims access to important information after the tragedy. The court ordered Russia to pay nearly €3 million to the families of the victims. </p>

<p>Russia's human rights record has been troubling to international rights groups for some time. In February the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">ordered </a> [JURIST report] Russia to pay more than €63,000 to <a href="https://navalny.com/">Alexander Navalny</a> [official website], a political opposition leader, for multiple arrests that infringed his right to peaceful assembly. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-sanctions-five-russian-officials-for-human-rights-abuses.php">sanctioned </a> [JURIST report] five Russian officials for human rights abuses stemming from the suspicious death of a Russian lawyer. Russia's response to terrorism attacks has also been troubling. In June 2016 the Russian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/russia-approves-anti-terrorism-amendments.php">passed </a> [JURIST report] a series of anti-terrorism laws that severely curtail certain religious activities and create fines for those who refuse to allow law enforcement officials to read private messages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/tokyo-h/">Tokyo High Court</a> [official website] on Thursday upheld a lower court obscenity decision against a female artist over distribution of 3-D printed models of vaginas. <a href="https://3dprint.com/tag/megumi-igarashi/">Megumi Igarashi</a> [3DPrint materials] is an artist who was <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/04/13/national/crime-legal/high-court-upholds-guilty-ruling-obscenity-case-vagina-artist-megumi-igarashi/#.WO-kpFPyut8">found guilty</a> [<em>Japan Times </em>report] of distributing the models. The lower court had held that Igarushi violated article 175 of the <a href="http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?ft=2&re=02&dn=1&yo=penal+code&x=0&y=0&ky=&page=1">Japanese Penal Code</a> [materials] because the modes "realistically reproduce the shape (of female genitalia) and stimulate the viewers sexual desire". The appeals court also upheld a $3,700 fine. </p>

<p>The decision has been seen as an attempt by Japan to control the values of the Japanese culture by prohibiting distribution of what it considers illicit materials detrimental to the society. Japan is not the only country that recently has attempted to reign in citizens to conform from what they believe are societal norms. Another country in Asia, Singapore, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/09/singapore-court-jails-teen-blogger.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] a teen of "wounding religious feelings" after he pleaded guilty to posting comments on the Internet criticizing Christianity and Islam in September. In 2015 India ordered more than 800 pornographic websites to be shut down in attempt to protect the decency of the country. However this attempt has run counter to the courts decision in the country that individuals should have the right to view the images. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a> [official website] chamber of Indian parliament approved a <a href="http://164.100.47.194/Loksabha/Legislation/MainSearch.aspx?qstr=Human+Immunodeficiency+Virus+and+Acquired+Immune+Deficiency+Syndrome">bill</a> [materials] Tuesday to provide for the prevention and control of HIV and AIDS as well as to protect the human rights of affected persons. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill was initially <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/billtrack/the-human-immunodeficiency-virus-and-acquired-immune-deficiency-syndrome-prevention-and-control-bill-2014-3126/">introduced </a> [PRS report] in 2014 by the <a href="http://mohfw.gov.in/">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare</a> [official website].  The legislation includes a focus on confidentiality and consent in medical treatment and extends protections into employment, housing and educational institutions. </p>

<p>Combating HIV has been an international concern for years. In January the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-files-lawsuit-against-nyc-for-denying-job-to-hiv-positive-applicant.php">filed a lawsuit </a> [JURIST report] against New York City for revoking the offer of an emergency dispatch position because the applicant was HIV positive. In June 2016 a group of UN independent human rights experts said that human rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-aids-epidemic-driven-by-human-rights-violations.php">violations contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS</a> [JURIST report]. In May of that same year California's governor signed Senate Bill 1408 into law, allowing HIV-positive individuals to become <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/california-passes-bill-allowing-hiv-positive-donors.php">transplant donors to HIV-positive recipients</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015 President Barack Obama issued <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13703.php">executive order 13703</a> [JURIST documents] "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy," which was intended to ensure successful implementation of the the updated national AIDS/HIV strategy. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia's <a href="http://selangor.kehakiman.gov.my/">Sepang court </a> [official website, in Malay] on Thursday postponed until May proceedings against two women accused of killing <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/14/profile-kim-jong-nam-exiled-half-brother-north-korean-dictator/">Kim Jong Nam</a> [<em>Telegraph </em>profile].The <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/1231968/assassination-suspects-appear-in-malaysian-court">hearing</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] was scheduled by request of the prosecutor to determine if the women would be tried jointly and in an attempt to move the case to a higher court. The court decided to postpone proceedings until May 30 to give time to collect more documents. If convicted, the women could face face death sentences. The women have maintained their innocence, alleging that they believed they were part of a game show prank, reportedly having engaged in these said pranks days leading up to the assassination. </p>

<p>The United States and South Korean intelligence officials have concluded that the assassination was organized by North Korean agents. In March a UN expert for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-calls-for-inquiry-into-death-of-kim-jong-nam.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of Kim Jong Nam over the strange circumstances of the assassination. North Korea is well known for its history of human rights violations. North Korea has been in the constant eye of the International Community, in February there was wide <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/international-community-condemns-north-korea-missile-test.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of a North Korea missile test. In July the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/us-sanctions-north-korea-leader-for-human-rights-violations.php">imposed sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on many North Korean officials, placing them on a black list of human rights abusers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Donald Trump on Thursday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/13/president-donald-j-trump-signs-hjres-43-law">signed</a> [press release] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/19/2016-30276/compliance-with-title-x-requirements-by-project-recipients-in-selecting-subrecipients">regulation</a> [text] that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. The new <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/43/text/rds">law</a> [materials] will allow states to block such abortion providers from federal funds provided through the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/index.html">Title X Family Planning program</a> [backgrounder]. In response to the action Executive Vice President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Dawn Laguens <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/planned-parenthood-condemns-president-trumps-signing-of-bill-that-threatens-health-care-protections-for-4-million-title-x-family">stated</a> [press release], "Planned Parenthood strongly opposes President Trump&#8217;s willingness to undermine millions of women&#8217;s access to birth control through the Title X family planning program. Four million people depend on the Title X family planning program, and by signing this bill, President Trump disregards their health and well-being."</p>

<p>In March this joint resolution <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-votes-to-allow-states-to-withhold-funds-from-abortion-providers.php">was passed</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate with Vice President Pence casting a tie-breaking vote. The joint resolution <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">was passed</a> [JURIST report] by the House of Representatives in February where they voted 230-188 in favor of the bill. The House vote was viewed as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-votes-to-free-states-to-strip-money-from-planned-parenthood-1487278549">first step</a> [WSJ report] in the process of defunding Planned Parenthood. There have been other legislative attempts to reduce abortion throughout the US as well. In January, the House <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-house-approves-bill-prohibiting-use-of-federal-money-for-abortions.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions. Additionally, in January, the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/oklahoma-top-court-strikes-down-law-restricting-abortion-access.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that added new licensing and inspection rules for facilities that perform abortions. In July, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-challenge-arizona-law-affecting-abortion.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against an Arizona law that could potentially prevent low-income women from obtaining healthcare from their chosen providers. Earlier in July, a US District Judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a Florida law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Over two dozen US insurance companies associated with <a href="https://www.travelers.com/">Travelers Companies</a> [corporate website] initiated a lawsuit on Wednesday against ten defendants over the September 11 terrorist attacks, including companies affiliated with Osama bin Laden's family, Saudi banks and several charities. The companies <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-sept-idUSKBN17F2FX">filed suit</a> [Reuters report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sept11">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] and alleges that the defendants aided and abetted the attacks through activities in support of al Qaeda. The defendants include National Commercial Bank, <a href="http://www.alahli.com/en-us/Pages/RB-NCB-Home-New.aspx">Al Rajhi Bank</a>, the Mohamed Binladin Company and the <a href="http://www.themwl.org/Profile/default.aspx?l=EN">Muslim World League</a> [organization websites]. This is the latest in a series of lawsuits filed after Congress overrode former President Obama's veto, in order to remove Saudi Arabia's immunity from US citizens' lawsuits. </p>

<p>Last month more than 850 family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/familes-of-911-victims-sue-saudi-arabia.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This legal challenge only became available after congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2040">Justice Against State Sponsors of Terrorism Act</a> [materials], which provided the legal recourse to sue foreign governments over the 9/11 attacks. After the bill passed in both chambers of congress it was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/obama-vetoes-911-bill-allowing-suit-against-saudi-arabia.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in September, who argued that the bill would open US diplomats and servicemen to suit abroad. Congress <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/congress-overrides-veto-of-911-bill-allowing-suit-against-saudi-arabia.php">overrode the presidential veto</a> [JURIST report] in a bipartisan effort. The law was quickly <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/saudi-arabia-condemns-passage-of-911-bill-authorizing-civil-suits-for-damages.php">condemned by Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iowa Governor <a href="https://governor.iowa.gov/">Terry Branstad</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGE/87/HF517.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery">signed legislation</a> [text, PDF] expanding gun rights in the state.  House File 517 <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/328712-iowa-governor-signs-sweeping-expansion-of-gun-rights">gives gun owners the ability</a> [The Hill report] to defend themselves in public and preventing local governments from implementing their own rules.  The law <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170413/iowa-governor-branstad-expands-the-second-amendment-rights-of-gun-owners-across-iowa">expands</a> [NRA report] Iowa's stand your ground rules as well as individuals with concealed-carry permits to have firearms in the capitol building.  The bill also eliminates the ability of the governor or other state officials from prohibiting possession of weapons in emergency situations.  The bill also legalizes short-barreled shotguns and rifles as well raising the burden of proof in order for someone to be convicted of a gun-related crime.</p>

<p>Gun ownership and carry rights have become an increasingly prevalent issue. In March North Dakota Governor Burgum <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-constitutional-carry-handgun-bill-into-law.php">signed a "constitutional carry" handgun bill</a> [JURIST report] into law.  Earlier that week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing individuals over the age of 21 to get enhanced concealed carry permits which will allow them to carry concealed weapons at public colleges, airports, polling places, sporting events, some state offices and the state capitol. Last month, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/new-hampshire-lawmakers-approve-permitless-conceal-carry-bill.php">repeal the law</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting state citizens from carrying concealed firearms without a permit. Earlier in February the US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hjres40/BILLS-115hjres40eh.pdf">voted to repeal</a> [text, PDF] an Obama-era gun regulation that required mental health information to be shared with the national gun background check system. In December Ohio Governor John Kasich signed <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/ohio-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">Senate Bill 199</a> [JURIST report], making it legal to carry concealed weapons at daycare facilities and onto college campuses. Last September the US Court of Appeals for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appellate-court-restores-gun-rights-for-offenders-in-minor-crimes.php">Third Circuit restored</a> [JURIST report] gun ownership rights of individuals convicted of minor crimes. Earlier that month the New Jersey Second Amendment Society <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/second-amendment-group-challenging-stun-gun-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the state's Attorney General in New Jersey's district court alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en.html">Canadian government</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2017/04/canada_takes_actiontolegalizeandstrictlyregulatecannabis.html">announced a plan</a> [press release] to legal recreational use of marijuana by July 2018.  Canada is set to implement this plan into law nationwide, though the government has stated that it would leave specific details, such as commercial regulations, up to each individual province.  Proponents of the plan have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/13/canada-is-poised-to-approve-a-law-legalizing-marijuana-nationwide/?utm_term=.0cefa824ab41">stated</a> [WP report] the measure is intended to limit adolescent drug use and take advantage of the profits that the black market is currently commanding.  Marijuana legalization was a campaign promise of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has received the support of not only the ruling Liberal party, but also from some of the country's Conservative Party.  The legislation would set a minimum purchasing age of 18.  Individuals would be allowed to posses up to 30 grams for personal use as well as grow up to four marijuana plants in their household.  Accompanying legislation to the bill would also increase penalties for driving under the influence.  There are those that are skeptical of the ability for this bill to decrease underage use <a href="http://www.newsherald.com/news/20170413/canada-poised-to-approve-recreational-cannabis-for-adults">stating</a> [<em>News Herald</em> report]: "Youth already think marijuana is harmless, and now we are giving them the government's seal of approval."</p>

<p>The use of legalization of marijuana has been an important issue for many countries around the world. In February the lower house of the Dutch parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dutch-lower-house-approves-bill-allowing-cultivation-of-cannabis.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would permit the cultivation of cannabis. In January Maine's governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/maine-governor-signs-marijuana-moratorium-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium bill that delayed the legal sale of marijuana by retailers for one year, although still allowed the possession of marijuana for personal use by those 21 or older. In April Mexico's president <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mexico-president-proposes-bill-relaxing-laws-on-marijuana-use.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a bill relaxing laws on marijuana use. In December 2015 Colombia's president <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] medical marijuana. In June 2015 Canada's top court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that the only acceptable form of medical marijuana was smoking the dried plant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/"> Office of Inspector General </a> [official website] on Wednesday released an investigative <a href="https://www.doioig.gov/sites/doioig.gov/files/AllegationsofSexualMisconductandReprisalYellowstone_Public.pdf"> report </a> [text, PDF] with findings on allegations of gender discrimination and sexual harassment at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm"> Yellowstone National Park </a> [government website]. The investigation began in September 2016 after an employee alleged that a pervasive culture of gender bias against women, sexual harassment, and financial misconduct existed in Yellowstone's maintenance division from 2011 to 2015. The report found credible evidence that male supervisors created a work environment that included unwelcome and inappropriate comments and actions towards women, which was allowed to continue because of the actions (and inactions) of the supervisors. The report also found that a supervisor had allowed his employees to use his government credit card in violation of the US Department of the Interior's <a href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.opengov.ibmcloud.com/files/uploads/DOIIntegratedChargeCardProgramPolicyFinalContent.pdf"> Integrated Charge Card Policy </a> [text, PDF]. The report concluded by noting that they found no evidence of hiring discrimination by the group.</p>

<p>The struggle for equal treatment in the workplace has been an issue in the United States for a long time and still continues today. On April 7th, the U.S. Department of Labor <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/dol-accuses-google-of-systemic-gender-compensation-disparities.php"> accused </a> [JURIST report] Google of engaging in compensation discrimination against female employees. Additionally, In January, the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Oracle America, Inc. <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/01/labor-department-sues-oracle-for-employment-discrimination.php"> alleging </a> [JURIST report] that the company engaged in a systemic practice of paying their Caucasian male workers more than other employees. Furthermore, in March of 2016 five members of the US women's soccer team <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-womens-soccer-players-file-complaint-over-wage-discrimination.php"> filed </a> an equal pay complaint against the US Soccer Federation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Steps have been taken to remedy some of the equal treatment issues, specifically among women. In January, the Mayor of Philadelphia <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/philadelphia-bans-employers-from-asking-for-salary-history.php"> passed a law </a> [JURIST report] barring employers from asking applicants about their past salaries. This law was designed to decreased the wage gap between men and women. New York City and the state legislatures of New Jersey and Pennsylvania are also considering similar measures. In October of 2015, the California Governor <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/california-adopts-fair-pay-act.php"> signed </a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0351-0400/sb_358_bill_20151006_chaptered.pdf"> Fair Pay Act </a> [official text] aimed at closing the wage gap between male and female employees.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Physician Jumana Nagarwala, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/detroit-emergency-room-doctor-arrested-and-charged-performing-female-genital-mutilation">was charged</a> [DOJ press release] Thursday in the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] for performing female genital mutilation (FGM) on minors out of a medical office in Livonia, Michigan. According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/957381/download">complaint</a> [text, PDF], the girls were as young as six to eight years of age and were transported from out of state by their parents or other family members secretly to the facility to perform the procedure. Federal authorities learned of Nagarwala's actions based on a tip from an unidentified source and interviews conducted of two minor victims from Minnesota who were taken by their parents to the Livonia facility to have the FGM done. This procedure has been banned in the US by <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap7-sec116.pdf">18 U.S.C. § 116</a> [text, PDF], and any violation of this law is punishable by up to five years imprisonment. This is believed to be the first case to be prosecuted under this law in the US. Nagarwala has also been charged under <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap117-sec2423.pdf">18 U.S.C. § 2423</a> (a) and (e) for "Transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy," and under <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap47-sec1001.pdf">18 U.S.C. § 1001</a> [texts, PDFs] for making false statements to a federal officer. The first of these charges carry a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, while the latter can result in imprisonment of up to five years. Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Blanco, together with other federal officials including the FBI Special Agent in Charge David Gelios, stated of these charges:<blockquote>The Department of Justice is committed to stopping female genital mutilation in this country, and will use the full power of the law to ensure that no girls suffer such physical and emotional abuse ... The FBI, along with its law enforcement partners, are committed to doing whatever necessary to bring an end to this barbaric practice and to ensure no additional children fall victim to this procedure ... The allegations against the defendant in this investigation are made even more deplorable, given the defendant&#8217;s position as a trusted medical professional in the community.</blockquote>.The UN, together with many human rights organizations across the world have been urging countries for several years to end the practice of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/">FGM</a> [WHO backgrounder]. In February 2016  former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-elimination-of-female-genital-mutilation-by-2030.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all concerned countries to eliminate female genital mutilation (FGM) by 2030, calling it a &#8220;violent practice" scarring girls for life [UN news report], endangering their health, depriving them of their rights, and denying them the chance to reach their full potential. In January 2016, former Gambia President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24383225">Yahya Jammeh</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/gambia-parliament-bans-female-genital-mutilation.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] banning FGM and condemning the practice as not commanded in the Quran. The UN has consistently campaigned for an end to FGM, labeling the practice, among other things, gender-based discrimination, torture, an affront to human dignity and an irreparable, irreversible abuse of the human rights of women and girls. In July 2014 former UK Prime Minister <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Cameron">David Cameron</a> [Britannica profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/uk-to-introduce-laws-to-eradicate-female-genital-mutilation.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to enact new laws that will protect girls from the practice. In July 2013 noting the continued pervasiveness of FGM, UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/unicef-female-genital-mutilation-on-decline.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] a world-wide decline in the practice due to multiple campaigns intended to educate parents on the emotional and physical health risks associated with the procedure and its aftermath. In December 2009 Uganda <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">outlawed</a> [JURIST report] FGM.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56559#.WPDfhBiZOu4">voted</a> [UN report] Thursday to end a 13-year-long peacekeeping operation in Haiti. The council will slowly downgrade the UN's presence in Haiti to a small policing force over the next six months. Following the <a href="http://undocs.org/S/2017/223">recommendations</a> [text, PDF] of <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/biography">Secretary-General Antonio Guterres</a> [official profile] the Council also agreed to establish the new United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH): an operation dedicated predominantly to aiding the Haitian government in strengthening its own legal institutions. MINUJUSTH is also authorized to "protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence, within its capabilities and areas of deployment, as needed." The Council has stated that the implementation of MINUJUSTH and the general reduction of UN presence in Haiti will enable the Haitian government to become more independent and lead to a "new chapter in [Haitian] history as the Mission transitions."</p>

<p>The UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti was <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/">established</a> [UN backgrounder] in 2004 following an armed conflict which ousted then-President Bertrand Aristide. Following the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Haiti-earthquake-of-2010">Haitian earthquake</a> [Britannica backgrounder] in 2010, the UN decided to increase  its presence to aid recovery, reconstruction, and stabilization efforts. The mission also took steps to aid Haitians effected by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/emergency.shtml">2010 cholera outbreak</a> [UN backgrounder]. However, Haiti is still <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38503654">recovering</a> [BBC report] from Hurricane Matthew, which killed approximately 1,000 people in October. Along with decimating infrastructure and leaving thousands internally displaced, Hurricane Matthew threatened to interfere with the general election scheduled for November of that year. The election was scheduled after the 2015 election was met with widespread allegations of fraud. Despite the hurricane, the elections went forward, and <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/02/jovenel-moise-sworn-haiti-president-170207161155899.html">Jovenel Moise</a> [Al Jazeera report] was elected the nation's new president. Critics are challenging his election after only 21 percentof eligible voters where able to reach the polls on election day. Many believe this is due to the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew. MINUJUSTH will now be the agency to help Moise politically stabilize the nation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri State House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB130&year=2017&code=R">bill</a> [materials] Thursday to standardize state-wide ride sharing rules and have sent it to the desk of <a href="https://ericgreitens.com/">Governor Eric Greitens</a> [official website]. If signed by Greitens, House Bill 130 will create uniform state-wide rules governing ride sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft. The bill was sponsored by <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/member.aspx?district=110&year=2017">Representative Kirk Mathews</a> [official profile] who claims that the bill will create thousands of jobs in Missouri and will entice ride-sharing companies to increase their presence in the state because they would no longer be subject to ad hoc county to county laws. On the bill, Matthews said: <br />
<blockquote>There's enormous demand for these services in our state. The economic driver that this can be for our state, not just in the way that there will be thousands of new small businesses, but keeping Missouri competitive to compete on the national stage for high-tech businesses. </blockquote>With the rapid growth of companies like Lyft and Uber, ride-sharing services have been among the most <a href="/feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. Earlier this month, The US District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a preliminary injunction to block Seattle's law that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-seattle-ride-sharing-union-law.php">allow drivers for taxis, Lyft and Uber to unionize</a> [JURIST report]. In March a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-approves-class-action-settlement-with-lyft-drivers.php">$27 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit between Lyft and its drivers. The suit challenged Lyft's characterization of the drivers as independent contractors. In December the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">European wing of Uber was indicted</a> [JURIST report] in Denmark on charges of assisting drivers in their violation of taxi laws, although Copenhagen prosecutor Vibeke Thorkil-Jensen stated that this is just a test case seeking judicial assessment of Uber's involvement in the illegal acts of two of its drivers. Last April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/uber-reaches-settlement-with-drivers-in-labor-dispute.php">Uber settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by 385,000 drivers in California and Massachusetts regarding their status as independent contractors. In several states, ride-sharing companies have met significant legal opposition, frequently led by competitors such as the taxi industry. <a href="/feature/2015/11/future-of-ride-sharing.php">Other unresolved questions</a> [JURIST backgrounder] surrounding this new business model continue to prompt debate among lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mississippi Supreme Court rules drugs used in executions can remain undisclosed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://courts.ms.gov/newsite2/index.php">Supreme Court of Mississippi</a> [government website] ruled to keep the identification of drugs used in executions a secret in a <a href="https://courts.ms.gov/Images/Opinions/CO121420.pdf">7-2 ruling</a> [text, PDF] Thursday. The lawsuit was brought against the <a href="http://www.mdoc.ms.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Mississippi Department of Corrections</a> [official website] by the <a href="http://www.macarthurjusticecenter.org/index.html">Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center</a> [advocacy website]. During <a href="https://courts.ms.gov/Newsite2/appellatecourts/sc/oawebcasts.php?vid=YVsCz76it0M/">oral arguments</a> [video], James Craig from the RSMJC argued that it was important to disclose the identities of the drugs used in executions, and that doing so would pose "no economic threat [to pharmacies, and] no physical threat, adding "[a]cross the country this is just being used as a dodge to prevent people from knowing where these dollars are going." In contrast, the state attorney general has held the position that disclosing the identity of the drugs would cause a threat to the pharmaceutical companies that supply the drugs, and further jeopardize the availability of drugs that are already difficult, and sometimes impossible, to obtain. Ultimately, the court deferred to the legislature, although RSMJC pointed out that the <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2017/pdf/HB/0600-0699/HB0638SG.pdf">law securing the identity of the drugs against a request for disclosure</a> [text, PDF] was enacted after the original suit was brought it 2014. Writing for the majority, Justice Michael Randolph, quoting and citing a case from Georgia and two previous Mississippi cases, said, "We must presume that the Mississippi Legislature meant what it said and said what it meant. It would be ludicrous for this Court to blindly follow the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 (MPRA) as it existed in 2014 when the documents at issue were requested and act as though we did not know the law, as adopted by the Legislature in 2016 and readopted in 2017."</p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. University of Mississippi School of Law professor William W. Berry III <a href="/forum/2017/04/the-execution-methods-crisis.php">wrote</a> [JURIST commentary] about the execution methods crisis. Last Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/appeals-court-upholds-ohio-injunction-on-lethal-injection.php">upheld</a> [JURST report] a preliminary injunction against Ohio's lethal injection process. In March, the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/tennessee-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's lethal injection protocols in a unanimous opinion. In February, the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. Also that month a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-delaying-ohio-exeuctions.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction that delays executions in Ohio. In January Judge Michael Merz <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. Also in January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In December a report by the Death Penalty Information Center found that the use of capital punishment in the US is at <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">a 20-year low</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Friday dropped a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. The DOJ originally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-complaint-against-state-north-carolina-stop-discrimination-against">filed</a> [press release] the lawsuit against the state in May 2016. The Justice Department decided to drop the lawsuit due to North Carolina's repeal of the bill last month. The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal have stated that they will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/04/14/justice-dept-drops-federal-lawsuit-over-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill/?utm_term=.c5a9893b4ecb">continue their lawsuit</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]  against the state. The repeal of <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2017/Bills/House/PDF/H142v5.pdf">House Bill 142,</a> [text, PDF] included a provision that no new law regarding private employment practices or regulating public accommodations may be enacted before December 1, 2020. Critics of the bill state that this provision prevents the state from passing new laws to protect LGBT individuals.</p>

<p>House Bill 2 has triggered a series of legal actions since its passage last year. North Carolina <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 last month with the passage of House Bill 142.  In February, six Democrats in the North Carolina House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/north-carolina-lawmakers-introduce-bathroom-bill-repeal.php">filed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to repeal HB2. Last May, former governor Pat McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/north-carolina-governor-asks-federal-courts-to-weigh-in-on-controversial-hb2.php">filed a complaint</a> for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill, but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST reports] from the lawsuit in September.  In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx">Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0043.aspx?src=ilaw">announced</a> [press release] Thursday sanction against the Iranian prison company Tehran Prisons Organization and one of its senior officials, Sohrab Soleimani, for human rights abuses at its Evin Prison. According to the release, "Former prisoners of Evin Prison have reported harsh interrogations, forced confessions, psychological and physical torture, and denial of access to medical care."  The sanctions are partly a reaction to an incident in April 2014 when prison officials beat political prisoners, injuring over 30 prisoners.  The Treasury Department invoked <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/13553.pdf">Executive Order 13553</a> [text, PDF], which allows it to sanction Iranian officials who commit human rights abuses.  OFAC Director John E. Smith said<blockquote>Today's designations highlight our continued support for the Iranian people and demonstrate our commitment to hold the Government of Iran responsible for its continued repression of its own citizens.... We will continue to identify, call out, and sanction those who are responsible for serious human rights abuses in Iran.<br />
</blockquote>Iran has already faced sanctions from the US over its nuclear weapons.  In March Iran <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/iran-imposes-sanctions-on-15-us-companies.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] reciprocal sanctions on 15 US companies after the US sanctioned nations that aided Iran's nuclear program.  A bill renewing US sanctions against Iran for another 10 years <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/iran-sanctions-extension-to-become-law-without-obamas-signature.php">became law</a> [JURIST report] last December. In response to renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has accused the US of breaching the nuclear agreement and has ordered the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation to plan the development of nuclear-powered ships. The US House had approved the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/us-house-approves-extension-of-iran-sanctions.php">extension of sanctions</a> [JURIST report] last November. In July 2015 the US entered into the JCPOA nuclear agreement with Iran where the county agreed not to create a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/iran-world-powers-reach-nuclear-agreement.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] after 20 months of negotiations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] (AI) released a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/usa-arkansas-must-urgently-halt-conveyor-belt-of-executions/">statement </a> [press release] on Thursday calling for Arkansas to halt the execution of eight death row prisoners. Arkansas has scheduled these execution to take place within short time spans of each other in order to beat the expiration of their drug of choice, midazolam. According to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2013/09/amnesty-international-welcomes-new-americas-director/">Erika Guevara Rosas</a> [official profile], Americas Director at AI, <blockquote>The close scheduling of these executions is unprecedented in modern US history. Just four months after the USA recorded its lowest execution total for a quarter of a century, Arkansas is preparing to buck this positive trend in a shameful race to beat a drug expiration date.</blockquote>The groups says there are also major legal concerns attached to the prisoners on death row. In some of their cases their attorneys failed to provide a full depiction of their background, which may have deterred the jury from sentencing them to death, and in two particular cases the prisoners have been diagnosed with serious mental disabilities, which qualifies their executions as <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/death-penalty/us-death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-and-mental-illness">contrary to international law</a> [AI backgrounder]. According to Rosas, death penalty cases has a list of problems, such as arbitrariness, inadequate legal representation, questionable prosecutorial tactics, and racial and economic discrimination.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF], released earlier this month, revealed the USA to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html"><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em></a> [text], that the execution of the "mentally retarded" is excessive under the Eighth Amendment and the Constitution "places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life" of such offender. In March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked </a>[JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That same month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-death-row-inmate-over-racial-bias.php">ruled </a> [JURIST report] in favor of a death row inmate seeking a new sentencing hearing based on racial bias caused by his ineffective counsel. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-urges-member-states-to-end-use-of-death-penalty.php">reaffirmed the UN's long-standing position</a> [JURIST report] against the death penalty and urged for member states to end use of it.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Third Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/16-2726/16-2726-2017-04-14.pdf?ts=1492189206">ruled</a> [opinion] that the family of a man who committed suicide while in solitary confinement can argue that he faced cruel and unusual punishment, even if they don't argue that the treatment lead to his suicide. In July 2012, Brandon Palakovic <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2014/07/13/Family-filing-suit-over-son-s-suicide-while-isolated-in-SCI-Cresson/stories/201407130136">committed suicide</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] while in solitary confinement at SCI Cresson serving a sentence for robbery. Palakovic's family brought an <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [LII, text] cruel and unusual punishment <a href="http://abolitionistlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/palakovic-v-wetzel-filed-7814.pdf">claim</a> [complaint] against the prison and prison officials for failure to treat Brandon Palakovic's documented mental health issues. The <a href="http://www.pawd.uscourts.gov/">Western District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] granted the State's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, finding that the 'vulnerability to suicide' standard applied and that the Palakovics failed to so plead. The Palakovics filed an amended complaint seeking to meet this standard, which was also dismissed. The Third Circuit clarified here that an Eighth Amendment claim need not fit into the 'vulnerability to suicide' framework, and that the Palakovics sufficient pled constitutional violations. Moreover, the Third Circuit found that the Palakovics' amended complaint sufficiently pled a 'strong likelihood' of self-harm. The Court urged that the 'strong likelihood' requirement does not "demand a heightened showing at the pleading stage by demonstrating &mdash; as the District Court seemed to require here &mdash; that the plaintiff's suicide was temporally imminent or somehow clinically inevitable."</p>

<p>Prisoner issues have been prominent across the world. In January, the UK Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/record-number-of-prison-deaths-in-england-and-wales-report.php">released figures</a> [JURIST report] demonstrating a record number of suicides and other deaths in prisons in England and Wales in 2016. Many experts and politicians have attributed the findings to overcrowding and a cut in funding and staffing. Following a clemency order issued by President Pierre Nkurunziza, Burundi's government <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/burund-government-releases-scores-of-prisoners.php">began releasing</a> [JURIST report] scores of prisoner earlier in January. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/aclu-of-hawaii-files-complaint-with-doj-over-conditions-in-jails.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice in January, stating that overcrowding in the state correctional facilities is resulting in violations of the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Court <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/content/us-district-judge-kristine-g-baker">Judge Kristine Baker</a> [official profile] on Saturday issued a temporary <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/sites/ared/files/Preliminary%20Injuction%20Order.pdf">injunction</a> [text, PDF] blocking Arkansas' plan to execute seven inmates by the end of the month. Baker's order comes a day after Arkansas state judge Wendell Griffen issued a <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/41417griffenorder/">broad temporary restraining order</a> [text] in favor of the prisoners. The plan was to begin executions on Monday, before the state's supply of midazolam, a drug used in the executions, expired at the end of the month. Midazolam is not the only drug facing criticism, however, as the McKesson Corporation has <a href="http://www.mckesson.com/about-mckesson/newsroom/press-releases/2017/response-to-arkansas-doc-planned-executions/">sought return</a> [press release] of the drug vecuronium bromide, one of its drugs used in the process.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/amnesty-calls-for-arkansas-to-stop-executions.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for Arkansas to halt the execution of then eight death row prisoners. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF], released earlier this month, revealed the US to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [text], that the execution of the "mentally retarded" is excessive under the Eighth Amendment and the Constitution "places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life" of such offender. In March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That same month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-death-row-inmate-over-racial-bias.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a death row inmate seeking a new sentencing hearing based on racial bias caused by his ineffective counsel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US District Judge William Orrick from the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who/sanctuary-litigation">Northern District of California</a> [official website] heard arguments Friday over President Trump's executive order withholding federal funds from so-called "sanctuary cities". San Fransisco and Santa Clara both <a href="https://www.sfcityattorney.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] asking for a nationwide preliminary injunction to the order. The <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-sanctuary-city-order-20170414-story.html">cities allege</a> [Bloomberg report] that the order would cause great harm to the American people and cause losses of billions of dollars in federal funding to the two cities, if they were not to abide by what they say are unconstituional demands. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-sanctuary-idUSKBN17G0RZ">Federal Government argued</a> [Reuters report], that it was a national policy priority and that there had been no enforcement yet, so it was unclear what the actual damage to the cities would be. Orrick agreed with the cities that they would be harmed if they abided by Trump's policy and that the cities had the right to sue to block it. It is not clear when a ruling in the case is expected.</p>

<p>Immigration has been a key focus for Trump since his inauguration. One part of Trump's plan has been to cut federal funding for cities that do not inquire into the immigration status and would not act with or on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the so called <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">'sanctuary cities'</a> [JURIST commentary]. Trump passed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united">executive order</a> [order] cutting funding to sanctuary cities. The order was also <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/seattle-sues-trump-over-sanctuary-cities-executive-order.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by the city of Seattle in March, arguing that their designation as a "sanctuary city" should not prevent them from receiving federal funds.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian criminal court in Cairo sentenced Habib el-Adly, the former interior minister under former president Hosni Mubarak, to seven years in jail on Saturday, for embezzling more than $100m of public funds. Adly was the head of Egypt's feared international security forces until the uprising that overthrew the Government in 2011. Adly has faced <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/habib-el-adly-year-jail-sentence-corruption-170415134416275.html">several criminal charges</a> [Al Jazeera report] in connection with his time in office, but had been acquitted of killing protesters in 2012 and of money laundering and profiteering charges in 2015. In 2015 Adly <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Egyptian-court-jails-Mubarak-era-interior-minister-for-corruption-488044">was released from prison</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post </em>report] after serving three years for using police officers as free labor on his properties. Along with Adly, <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2017/04/15/habib-el-adly-sentenced-7-years/">100 other ministry officials</a> [Daily News report] were accused of accepting bribes. The court dismissed charges against 80 defendants in January 2016, due to a lack of evidence. On Friday two other officials were also sentenced to seven years in prison and the court ordered them all three to pay back $108m and fined them the same amount. The decision can still be appealed to the highest court of Egypt. </p>

<p>Mubarak, Adly and other members of his administration have been consistently involved in some form of judicial proceeding since the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In 2015 an <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/egypt-court-clears-mubarak-era-official-of-last-corruption-charge.php">Egyptian court acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Habib el-Adly of charges alleging he used his political influence to acquire approximate $23 million. Also in 2015 Habib el-Adly was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-clears-mubarak-officials-of-corruption.php">cleared of all charges</a> [JURIST report] for "squandering public funds and profiteering" after allegedly making an illegal deal with German Company UTSCH to sell license plates for higher than market value. In 2017, Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/top-egypt-court-acquits-ex-president-mubarak-of-2011-killings.php">cleared of all charges </a> [JURIST report] in a retrial of charges that he killed protesters during the civil uprising in 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aya Hijazi, a dual US-Egyptian citizen who has been in prison for three years in relation to her foundation dedicated to helping street children, was of acquitted all charges by a Cairo court on Sunday. Seven others, including HIzaji's husband, were found not guilty as well. The eight members of Hijzai's foundation were arrested in 2014 for allegations of child abuse, human trafficking, kidnapping, sexual exploitation, and torture. Human rights groups have been critical of the arrest, calling it "arbitrary" and unfounded by legitimate evidence, while Joe Stork, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] deputy for the Middle East and North Africa, called the trial "a travesty of justice." All eight defendants are <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/egypt-aya-hijazi-acquitted-years-detention-170416114051408.html">set to be released</a> [Aljazeera report]  in the upcoming days.</p>

<p>Egypt has been under the international spotlight lately for its human rights abuses, particularly, it's treatment of journalists. In February, <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/02/un-sg-welcomes-egypt-release-of-al-jazeera-journalists.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the decision by Egyptian authorities to release on bail two Al Jazeera journalists awaiting retrial on terror charges. The men were <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/12/egyptian-authorities-detain-al-jazeera-journalists.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2013 along with fellow Al Jazeera journalist and Australian national Peter Greste. In March Greste was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/02/jurist-political-conflict-in-egypt.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from the Cairo detention facility and deported, under a law allowing the deportation of foreign nationals to their home countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers for US President Donald Trump, in their <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-6ee7-db04-ad5b-7fef52a70002">answer</a> [text, PDF] to a lawsuit Friday, contended the president was immune from being sued by protesters who were injured during a campaign rally in Louisville in 2016. The attorneys argued Trump was immune due to being the president. In addition, his attorney's argued the protesters waived any right to sue after buying a ticket to the rally and contended Trump had not urged the crowd to "get [the protesters] out of here." The contentions of Donald Trump in his answer were <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-claims-immunity-president-protesters-lawsuit-46818791">contradictory to claims</a> [[ABC news] made by Alvin Bamberger, a  co-defendant in the lawsuit who was accused of pushing a black woman at the rally; Bamberger argues he was simply following Trump's orders in shoving the woman. A federal judge earlier this month <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rejects-president-trumps-free-speech-defense-to-rally-violence.php">rejected a free speech defense</a> [JURIST report] by President Trump in the ongoing lawsuit.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's election campaign faced serious concerns over eliciting violence against those opposed to his cause. In November state democrats <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/11/voter-intimidation-injunction-pennsylvania-230901">raised voter intimidation suits in six states</a> [Politico report], yet only a federal judge in Ohio granted the requested injunction before being <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/federal-appeals-court-stays-order-blocking-voter-intimidation-ativities-in-ohio.php">rejected on appeal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Turkey's president, <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile], announced a victory on Sunday after 51.5 percent of Turkish voters elected to expand presidential powers.  However, his political opponents are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-referendum-idUSKBN17H0CU">demanding</a> [Reuters report] a recount as some of the ballots did not contain an official stamp. The changes, which will not come into effect until 2019, would abolish the position of prime minister and give the president powers formerly granted to Parliament.  Those who voted "yes" point to security concerns, while those who voted "no" fear authoritarianism.  Erdogan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/world/europe/turkey-referendum-polls-erdogan.html">said</a> [NYT report], "We are enacting the most important governmental reform of our history."  The Turkish Parliment <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/turkey-parliament-approves-plan-to-strengthen-presidential-powers.php"> approved</a> [JURIST report] the plan in January before the popular vote. </p>

<p>Since the failed coup in Turkey in July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power.  In March the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-reports-recent-human-rights-violations-in-southern-turkey.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Southern Turkey. Earlier in March around 330 individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">put on trial</a>[JURIST report] for alleged involvement in the attempted coup.  In November Turkey significantly restricted the activities of NGOs like human rights organizations and children's groups and <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested opposition party leaders</a> [JURIST report] alleging they were connected to terror organizations. In October Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-turkish-emergency-decrees-permitting-government-sanctioned-torture.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the emergency decrees put in place after the failed coup, had resulted in serious human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former South Korean president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20787271">Guen-Hye Park</a> [BBC profile] was indicted on numerous corruption charges including extortion, abuse of power, and bribery on Monday. Prosecutors from the <a href="http://www.spo.go.kr/eng/index.jsp">Seoul Central District Prosecutors' officer</a> [official website] also indicted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/shin-dong-bin/">Shin Dong-bin</a> [Forbes profile], chairman of the <a href="https://www.lotte.co.kr/eng/index.jsp">Lotte Group</a> [official website], on similar bribery charges but did not move to have Dong-bin detained. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-park-idUSKBN17J0I3">stated</a> [Reuters report] that Lotte paid approximately $6 million US to Park for a wide variety of favors after experiencing operational turbulence at their locations in China. Park will remain in a Seoul prison and will be transported to and from the <a href="http://seoul.scourt.go.kr/main/new/Main.work">Seoul Central District Court</a> [official website] for the entirety of her trial. The trial is expected to being in the coming weeks, however, it is still unclear if the trial will start before a special election to determine Park's successor which is currently scheduled for May 9th. The trial could take as long as six months. </p>

<p>This is the latest development in a scandal that has grown to encompass numerous South Korean political and corporate leaders. Earlier this month South Korea's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/high-court-upholds-impeachment-of-south-korean-president.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] parliament's decision to impeach Park over a scandal related to government bribes paid by Samsung. South Korean lawmakers voted <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-to-impeach-president-park-geun-hye.php">234-56 to impeach</a> [JURIST report] Park in December. In February Samsung's would-be head Lee was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/samsung-head-arrested-for-corruption-scandal-involving-south-korea-president.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery and undue influence in connection with the scandal. Five Samsung executives <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/samsung-executives-deny-bribery-charges.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] of bribery, embezzlement and corruption that were leveled against them in connection with Park. Two weeks ago the Seoul Central District Court said that it <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/south-korea-court-reassigns-samsung-case-to-new-judge.php">reassigned Lee's bribery case</a> [JURIST report] to a new judge, after reports surfaced the same week concerning the previous judge's connection to a woman Lee is accused of bribing. In February South Korea's special prosecutor<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/south-korea-indicts-former-culture-minister-top-aide-for-abuse-of-power.php"> indicted</a> former culture minister Yoon-sun Cho [official profile] and former presidential chief of staff Ki-choon Kim on charges of coercion, abuse of power and perjury connected to creation of a blacklist of opposition artists critical to Park. Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-south-korea-president-arrested.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking government secrets on March 31. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/hearinglists/HearingList-April2017.pdf">heard</a> [hearing list, PDF] oral arguments Monday on <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/perry-v-merit-systems-protection-board/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board</a>, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-chester-v-laroe-estates-inc/">Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/california-public-employees-retirement-system-v-moody-investors-service-inc/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System v. ANZ Securities, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] In Perry, the Court will decide whether a decision disposing of a case which involved both state employment actions and a federal anti-discrimination law dismissed on jurisdictional grounds can be subject to judicial review in either district court or in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In Chester, the Court will decide if intervenors joining a suit under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_24">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)</a> must have <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [LII backgrounders] standing or if standing is satisfied as long as there is a valid case or controversy between the parties. ANZ will decide if the filing of a putative class action satisfies the three-year time limitation in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_exchange_act_of_1934">Section 13 of the Securities Act</a> [LII backgrounder]. This will be the first week that newly appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch will be on the bench. </p>

<p>Gorsuch was confirmed last week after a contentious battle between Democrats and Republicans over the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Scalia's death in February 2016, then-President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-nominates-judge-merrick-garland-to-us-supreme-court.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans <a href="/forum/2016/10/why-the-supreme-court-is-not-a-key-issue-in-the-presidential-election-and-why-it-should-be.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST commentary] Garland, insisting that the next president should choose the nominee. Following President Donald Trump's election to the White House and Republican retention of control over the Senate, the nomination of a conservative judge appeared likely. Trump fostered intrigue over his appointment by releasing a list of <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trumps-supreme-court-nominees-233115">21 potential nominees</a> [Politico report] before ultimately selecting Gorsuch. Despite a Republican majority in the Senate, Gorsuch's confirmation was not unchallenged. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had to invoke the so-called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-senate.html?_r=0">"nuclear option"</a> [NYT report] to bypass a filibuster by Democrats, which reduced the number of votes needed to invoke cloture from 60 to 50. The move was necessary because the 52 Republican members of the Senate would not have the votes to defeat the filibuster without Democratic support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The under-secretary-general for the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)</a> [official website] Stephen O'Brien on Sunday <a href="https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Documents/USG%20Statement%20Syria%2016.04.17.pdf">condemned</a> [press release] attacks against people, including many civilians, who were fleeing the Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya. In his statement, O'Brien said the "perpetrators of such a monstrous and cowardly attack displayed a shameless disregard for human life," adding, "International humanitarian law is very clear: warring parties must protect civilians and distinguish between military and civilian targets." O'Brien said he was "horrified" by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39613313">reports of explosions</a> [BBC report] that occurred in the area Saturday, killing more than 120 people, including at least 68 children. Although O'Brien did not specify the international laws he is referring to in the statement, he has <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/13333db8024844efb4d8e7d64af65e24/un-laws-war-systematically-disregarded-syria">previously cited</a> [<em>AP</em> report] the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [materials] as the controlling body of law regarding civilian casualties in the Syrian Civil War. <blockquote>While the United Nations was not involved in this agreement or evacuation process, we are ready to scale up our support to evacuees. In that regard, I call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, and to facilitate safe and unimpeded access for the UN and its partners to bring lifesaving help to those in need.</blockquote>The Syrian Civil War began in 2011, and <a href="/feature/2013/07/an-introduction-to-the-syrian-civil-war.php">has resulted in</a> [JURIST backgrounder] hundreds of thousands of civilians death, a global refugee crisis, and the rise of terrorist organizations such as ISIS. Last week, the Group of Seven (G7) nations <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/g7-fails-to-reach-deal-on-syria-sanctions.php">failed to reach an agreement</a> on whether to impose new sanctions on Russia and Syria. Earlier this month, the UN Security Council conducted emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. The next evening, the US military <a href="/2017/04/06/us-military-has-launched-more-50-than-missiles-aimed-at-syria-nbc-news.html">attacked</a> [CNBC report] a Syria-government airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles. Following the US missile launch, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-sg-restraint-necessary-to-avoid-escalation-in-syria.php">restraint</a> [JURIST report] in handling the situation in Syria. Also last week, US Speaker of the House Paul Ryan <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/speaker-calls-on-trump-to-consult-congress-following-syria-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] President Donald Trump to consult Congress on potential further action following a military strike on Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://abc.xyz">Alphabet Inc.</a> [official website], owner of Google, and the <a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru">Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service</a> (FAS) [official website], <a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru/press-center/news/detail.html?id=49774">reached</a> [FAS press release] an out-of-court settlement with in a dispute over Google's requiring Android phone manufacturers to pre-install its own search tool on Monday. In 2015 the FAS ruled that this requirement was an abuse of Google's market dominance and its actions excluded competing Russian search engines such as <a href="https://www.yandex.com">Yandex</a> [official website]. After the FAS imposed a $7.8 million US fine on Google, Alphabet Inc. proposed a settlement in which the company agreed to refrain from requiring manufactures to pre-install their search engine services on Android devices. In its place, Google will develop a new Chrome widget which will allow end users to install the search applications of any company they desire. According to the settlement, Russian competitors will be able to begin contacting Google for their inclusion in the new search widget in 60 days. The head of the FAS, <a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru/about/structure/profile.html?id=1">Igor Artemiev</a> [official profile], stated: <blockquote>Implementation of the settlement&#8217;s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications. We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices. The settlement&#8217;s execution will have a positive effect on the market as a whole, while giving developers additional options for promoting their products.</blockquote>FAS first began investigation Google's search software practices after Yandex filed a complaint in 2015. In September 2015 the FAS ruled that Google's practices violated <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ru/ru077en.pdf">Part 1 Article 10 of the Russian Federal Law</a> [text] by using its dominant position in the market to exclude competitors from its Android devices. Google has faced numerous anti-trust claims all over the world. In April 2016 the EU <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/20/technology/google-android-lawsuit-europe/">levied</a> [CNN report] anti-trust charges against Google for some of  the same practices addressed in the FAS's suit. Google is currently facing a $3.4 billion US anti-trust fine from the European Commission in the matter. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Over 1,000 Palestinian political prisoners in six Israeli prisons embarked on an indefinite hunger strike starting on Monday, in observance of Palestinian Prisoners Day.  The strikers say they <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/palestinian-prisoners-launch-mass-hunger-strike-170416173501861.html">want</a> [Al Jazeera report] better medical care, more humane transfers between prisons, and the end of "administrative detention" where Palestinians are arrested without knowing why.  According to Addameer, a prisoners' rights advocacy group, <a href="http://www.addameer.org/statistics">500 prisoners</a> [advocacy website] in Israeli jails are administrative detainees.  The strike is led by Marwan Barghouti, who was convicted for participating in a terrorist attack against Israel.  Israel <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/hundreds-of-palestinian-prisoners-launch-mass-hunger-strike/">claims</a> [<em>Times of Israel </em>report] the strikes are a "power play" by Barghouti.  Prisoners of diverse political beliefs are participating in the strike, and rallies outside the prisons are expected to occur in solidarity. </p>

<p>While Israel and Palestine have a troubled past, the issue of settlements in the West Bank have escalated tensions in the last decade.  Earlier this month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">said</a> [JURIST report] it was disappointed with the Israel settlement decision. In November Israel's Ministerial Committee for Legislation unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/israel-legislative-committee-approves-bill-legalizing-west-bank-outposts.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Formalization Bill to legalize the West Bank outposts. In March 2016 the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-office-concerned-about-extra-judicial-execution-in-west-bank.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the office is concerned about the apparent extra-judicial execution of a Palestinian man in the West Bank. In January of that same year Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-urges-businesses-to-cease-operations-in-israel-settlements.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] businesses to cease operations in Israel settlements. In August 2015 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-officials-denounce-west-bank-arson-attack-that-killed-palestinian-child.php">urged both sides of the conflict</a> [JURIST report] to reconcile and move towards peace after an attack occurred in the West Bank village of Duma, where Jewish extremists allegedly set fire to a Palestinian home while a family slept inside. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersbycircuit/ordercasebycircuit/041717ordercasesbycircuit">declined to hear an appeal</a> [order list] by a group of Central American asylum-seekers Monday who hoped the Court would overturn a lower court's ruling preventing them from having their removal orders reviewed by a federal judge. The lead plaintiff in the case, Rosa Castro, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/castro_v._dhs_-_district_court_opinion_2_16_15.pdf">fled</a> [memo, PDF] El Salvador in 2015 with her young son, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-asylum-idUSKBN17J11W">seeking asylum</a> [Reuters report] from what she said was ongoing physical and emotional abuse by her husband. The lower court ruled that the status of the families, all of whom were apprehended in Texas, was akin to non-citizens and that they were therefore not entitled to a court hearing. The women and their children challenged in federal court the rejection of their asylum claims, alleging a violation of their constitutional right to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> [LII backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/161339p.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] their constitutional argument, holding that due to their status as non-citizens, they are not provided with constitutional rights of review if denied entry.</p>

<p>Immigration, deportation and the detention of immigrants has been a matter of national controversy for years and has been a particular focus of US President Donald Trump. The issue has culminated in lawsuits <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-denies-rehearing-of-trumps-original-immigration-order.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] Trump's controversial executive orders affecting migrants. Last month, the US Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) released a report finding that a significant portion of federal law enforcement resources were directed to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-report-federal-law-enforcement-resources-concentrated-on-immigration-arrests.php">immigration-related offenses</a> [JURIST report]. The analysis showed that half of all federal arrests in 2014 were related to immigration, with 61 percent of them occurring in five districts along the US-Mexico border. In January, seven days after his inauguration, Trump issued an immigration-related executive order, which limited migration from seven Muslim-majority countries, among other changes. These policies have been criticized as part of a larger overhaul of the country's approach to immigration undertaken by the new administration, <a href="/forum/2017/02/trumps-immigration-order-signals-sharp-departure-from-other-post-wwii-presidents.php">largely departing</a> [JURIST op-ed] from the policies of other post-WWII presidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy groups <a href="https://www.justice4all.org/">Legal Aid Justice Center</a> and the <a href="https://acluva.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="https://www.justice4all.org/2017/04/17/ocr-investigating-richmond-public-schools/">announced Monday</a> [press release] that the <a href="https://www.ed.gov/">US Department of Education</a> [official website] has launched a civil rights investigation of Richmond Public Schools.  The probe comes at the request of advocacy groups who <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/u-s-department-of-education-launches-civil-rights-probe-of/article_dd8afcf8-d2c2-572b-a577-f95c7467ddea.html">argue</a> [<em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em> report] the district's disciplinary policies discriminate against black students and students with disabilities.  <a href="https://www.justice4all.org/">Legal Aid Justice Center</a> and the <a href="https://acluva.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia</a> [advocacy websites] argued that disparities could be found in the treatment of the impacted students.  Richmond Public School officials have pledged to cooperate with the federal education department.</p>

<p>Treatment of students has become an increasingly prevalent issue in American society.  Last week New York <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/new-york-passes-law-offering-free-college-tuition-to-residents.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] offering free college tuition to state residents.

Earlier that month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-rules-school-districts-must-individualize-education-for-disabled-students.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] school district must individualize education for disabled students.  In February the Trump administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">revoked public school transgender bathroom guidelines</a> [JURIST report] implemented by the Obama administration.  Also in February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-remands-case-on-service-dog-in-elementary-school.php">remanded a dispute</a> [JURIST report] regarding a disabled student with a service dog and a school's refusal to accommodate the student.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/18/theresa-mays-early-general-election-speech-full/"> called for</a> [statement, text] an early general election to take place on June 8th of this year as opposed to the scheduled 2020 general election. May's decision to call for the election is thought to have been spurred by political divisions in parliament as the talks on Brexit with the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en"> European Union </a> (EU) [official website] are sent to begin soon. The May's motion for the election will need the support of 2/3 of the Members of Parliament to go into effect. May's Conservative Party currently holds 330 of the 650 seats, a slim majority, in the <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/"> House of Commons </a> [official website]. In calling for the snap election, the hope appears to be to give her party a stronger mandate in the House of Commons in order to avoid going into negotiations with the EU in a divided state. In her speech, May called for unity in the House of Commons, saying: <blockquote> So, tomorrow, let the House of Commons vote for an election, let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programmes for Government, and let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the country the strong and stable leadership it demands. </blockquote> The Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has welcomed May's call for the early election to give the people a chance to vote for the government they want.</p>

<p>Since its conception over the summer, Brexit has been a hot topic in Europe. Most recently, on March 31st, European Union President Donald Tusk <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-president-donald-tusk-outlines-future-plans-with-uk-following-brexit.php"> laid out plans </a> [JURIST Report] for the EU's future negotiations with the UK about Brexit. On March 30th, the UK <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-publishes-bill-to-replace-eu-laws.php"> published </a> [JURIST report] the Great Repeal Bill, which outlined the process to solve issues that could arise as Britain leaves the EU. Prior to that, Prime Minister may <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-pm-triggers-article-50-to-begin-brexit.php"> triggered </a> [JURIST report] Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29th, which formally began the legal process of Britain leaving the European Union. Earlier in March, the EU Withdrawal Bill (Brexit Bill) <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brexit-bill-receives-royal-assent-and-becomes-law.php"> received </a> [JURIST report] royal assent and officially became UK law. In June a majority of UK citizens <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php"> voted </a> [JURIST report] to leave the EU due to a growing discontent with EU policies, including immigration. At the time, critics of Brexit were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-may-priorities-idUSKBN1502H2"> concerned </a> [Reuters report] with the domestic and global economic implications, as the UK would be cut off from European trade markets unless an agreement could be reached.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Paris <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/organisation-de-la-justice-10031/lordre-judiciaire-10033/tribunal-correctionnel-12028.html">Criminal Court</a> [official website], began a trial Tuesday over the alleged abuse of two minors by a French soldier in Burkina Faso in 2015. The French soldier, only recognized by the name Sebastian L., is alleged to film himself touching the young girls in a hotel pool. Sebastian was in Burkina Faso as part of a French strike force there to combat Islamic militants in the region. The charges were only brought after the mother of the victims <a href="http://www.slateafrique.com/739211/un-militaire-francais-juge-mardi-pour-des-agressions-sexuelles-au-burkina">found</a> [Slate Afrique report, in French] a camera left behind at her home after Sebastian and another soldier had visited her home. The footage revealed the alleged abuse, which led to an immediate withdrawal of the two soldiers back to France. If convicted of the offense,Sebastian could face up to 10 years in prison. </p>

<p>All across the world children are subject to sexual abuse at the hands of adults. This issue spans borders and leaves lasting impacts on the lives of all the children unfortunate enough to experience this trauma in their lifetime. On Monday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/foundation-members-acquitted-of-abuse-charges-by-egypt-court.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a dual American-Egyptian citizen over an organization which attempted to help street children citing that the state lacked to provide any substantial evidence. Yet in America a tradition that has taken root in Africa has found its way to the state of Michigan. On Friday a Michigan doctor was charged for performing <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/michigan-doctor-charged-with-female-genital-mutilation.php">female genital mutilation</a> [JURIST report] on minors out of his office. The problem of sexual abuse of minors is clearly an issue the world has been struggling to cope with. In response, the United Nations in January <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-announces-plan-to-create-high-level-task-force-on-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse.php">announced a plan</a> [JURIST report] to create high-level task force on sexual exploitation and abuse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australia's Prime Minister, <a href="https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/">Malcom Turnbull,</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-to-abolish-457-immigration-work-visas-20170418-gvmw34.html">announced</a> [video] Tuesday that the country will be introducing stricter visa requirements for skilled foreign workers. The Prime Minister said the focus is to ensure that Australian jobs are "given to Australians first." The current 4-year work visa program, <a href="https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/457-">457 visa program</a> [materials], which allows workers from overseas to live in Australia with their immediate family, will be <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39626389">abolished</a> [BBC report] and will be replaced by two temporary visas that carry additional obstacles.  Some of the changes require English proficiency, an increase in application fees, subjection to labor market testing, and additional barriers to permanent migration after the work visa expires. People currently holding a 457 visa will not be affected.</p>

<p>This restriction on foreign workers is in response to the Australian government's promise to roll back work visas granted to fast-food restaurants. Since 2012, more than 500 foreign workers have been <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39137029">granted</a> [BBC report] a 457 visa to work at businesses including McDonald's, KFC and Hungry Jack's. The country is concerned with the role the visa holders are actually fulfilling, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-02/government-cracking-down-on-457-visas-for-fast-food-workers/8317432">compared</a> [ABC report] with the role they applied for. Moreover, the program has been under fire for the alleged <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39128738">exploitation</a> [BBC report] of migrant workers. If migrant workers are given the jobs,  lawmakers fear that Australians are losing out to foreigners in the Australian job market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian authorities <a href="http://tass.com/world/941880">say </a> [TASS report] they have detained, and obtained a confession from, a man linked to a terrorist metro bombing in St. Petersburg that killed 14 passengers. The <a href="http://government.ru/en/department/113/">Russian Federal Security Service</a> [official website] says that Abror Azimov pled guilty to planning the attack. Officials say that, for his part, Azimov says that he does not object to being detained and does not deny his involvement in the attack, but says he was not involved in planning, and did not plead guilty. </p>

<p>The attack was<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/europe/st-petersburg-russia-explosion-suspect.html"> carried out</a> [NY Times report] on April 3 by a suicide bomber. The man who brought the explosive device onto the train carriage was a man from Kyrgyzstan with a Russian passport. Russia has stepped up its anti-terrorism laws recently, <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/russia-approves-anti-terrorism-amendments.php">creating </a> [JURIST report] a series of laws last summer that punish proselytizing, failing to report certain types of crimes, and force cell phone companies to store all communications data for 6 months.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wisconsin Governor <a href="https://www.scottwalker.com/">Scott Walker</a> [official website] signed <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2017/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb10">Senate Bill 10</a> [materials], legalizing the medicinal use of a marijuana extract, into law Monday. The bill, which was passed by both houses of the Wisconsin legislature earlier this year, allows patients to receive Cannabidiol from a physician or pharmacy with a prescription. The oil, which contains THC common in marijuana, will be used to treat medical conditions and does not produce a high or psychoactive effect. Research shows that the oil has positive effects when used to treat seizures, pain, anxiety, and other disorders. The state had seen a <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/17/gov-scott-walker-sign-labor-cannabis-oil-bills/100559792/">push from its citizens</a> [<em>Journal Sentinel</em> report] to allow the use of the oil to help in a variety of medical circumstances, including the legislation gaining the name Lydia's law, for a 6 year old girl who died without having access to the treatment. The legislation was passed with almost unanimous support, only 1 person opposed, which is a turn from a piece of legislation that was voted down last year. </p>

<p>In recent times, states have begun to recognize the medical benefits that are provided by cannabis, and have introduced laws that allow it to become legal on a variety of levels. JURIST Guest Columnist Jody H. Lehrer, of Northeastern Institute of Cannabis, discusses the <a href="/hotline/2016/11/the-most-significant-gain-from-cannabis-legalization-one-lawyers-perspective.php">national movement towards the legalization</a> [JURIST op-ed] of cannabis and the effects that it might have on the nation. To gain a perspective on medical marijuana JURIST Guest Columnist Amy St. John, manager at Earth's Healing, <a href="/hotline/2016/12/an-insiders-perspective-on-medical-marijuana.php">shares some professional experiences </a> [JURIST op-ed] and personal opinions from her time spent working inside the marijuana industry. As more States continue to pass legislation that allows for various forms of use of cannabis, it is worth noting that it is still an illegal substance at the federal level. JURIST Guest Columnist Hilary Bricken, of Canna Law Group, discusses the Trump administration and how it could <a href="/hotline/2016/11/Hilary-Bricken-Fear-and-Loathing.php">impact the status</a> [JURIST op-ed]of cannabis at the state level. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> on Tuesday held unanimously in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1406_db8e.pdf">Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger </a> [opinion, PDF] that a monetary sanction of <a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/bad-faith/">bad faith conduct</a> [Black's Law Dictionary backgrounder] is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred because of the conduct.<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx"> Justice Kagan</a> [official profile] delivered the opinion of the court. <blockquote>We hold that such an order is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred solely because of the misconduct&#8212;or put another way, to the fees that party would not have incurred but for the bad faith. A district court has broad discretion to calculate fee awards under that standard. But because the court here granted legal fees beyond those resulting from the litigation misconduct, its award cannot stand.</blockquote>The case stems from a motor accident in which the respondents motorhome swerved and flipped over. The Haegers claimed that a certain type of Goodyear tire caused the accident as it was not within industry standards, saying the tires became too hot when they were used at highway speeds. The Haegers had asked Goodyear to turn over all tests on the tires that Goodyear had performed. According to court records, Goodyear was reluctant and slow to respond to the request. After settling the case, the Haegers later discovered that Goodyear had released test results in another lawsuit that they did not release to the plaintiffs in this case. Goodyear admitted to withholding the data and the Haegers sought sanctions for bad faith through Goodyear's discovery fraud.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/hearinglists/HearingList-April2017.pdf">oral arguments</a> [hearing list, PDF] on Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-fdcases/kokesh-v-securities-and-exchange-commission/">Kokesh v. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/henson-v-santander-consumer-usa-inc/">Henson v. Santander Consumer USA, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders]. In <u>Kokesh</u>, the court is asked to decide whether the five-year statute of limitations in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2462">28 U.S.C. § 2462</a> [text] applies to claims for &#8220;disgorgement.&#8221; Under this statute of limitations, &#8220;enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture&#8221; be &#8220;commenced within five years from the date when the claim first accrued.&#8221; The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for decades has been suing violators of federal securities laws for disgorgement of their "ill-gotten gains," though legislative history reveals no explicit creation of a disgorgement remedy or whether this statute of limitation applies. The question will turn on whether disgorgement is considered one of either a penalty or forfeiture.  This case was appealed from a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-529-opinion-below-10th-cir.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>In <u>Henson</u>, the court is asked to determine whether a company that regularly attempts to collect debts it has purchased after falling into default is considered a &#8220;debt collector&#8221; and thus subject to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [text]. These "debt buyers" only collect on the debts they purchase, rather than providing collection services to the lenders that originated the loans or credit. The FDCPA defines debt collector as "any person who regularly collects...debts owed or due...another." The question will turn on who is owed the debts and who the debts are due to. Either the debts are due and owing to the debt buyers that purchased them-which would make the debt buyers free from regulation under the FDCPA-or the debts are owed to the entity that originated them but due to the debt buyer who acquired them. This case was appealed from a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16-349-opinion-below-4th-cir.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website].</p>

<p>This marks the first week of oral arguments in which <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/gorsuch-sworn-in-as-supreme-court-justice.php">newly-appointed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-neil-gorsuch/">Justice Neil Gorsuch</a> [SCOTUSblog profile] will sit on the bench of the Supreme Court.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-149_6jfm.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/coventry-health-care-of-missouri-inc-v-nevils-2/">Coventry Health Care of Missouri, Inc. v. Nevils</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a Missouri statute, which served to expand insurance benefits for federal employees, is preempted under federal law. Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA), the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM) [official website] is authorized to contract with private carriers for federal employees&#8217; health insurance policies. These policies include "subrogation" clauses that allow the insurers to recover funds incurred by the insureds from third parties, most often through tort lawsuits. Missouri, like other states, has a consumer-protection statutes that invalidates subrogation clauses in insurance contracts. FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8902">§8902(m)(1)</a> [text], which states that the "terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law . . . which relates to health insurance or plans." The court found that contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions plainly "relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits," and therefore they override state laws barring subrogation and reimbursement. Furthermore, the court determined that the statute preempts the Missouri state law.</p>

<p>The case arose when Jodie Nevils was injured in a car accident. He was a federal employee with an FEHBA health insurance plan offered through Coventry Health Care of Missouri. Coventry paid his medical expenses incurred in the accident. Nevils reached a settlement with the driver who caused his injuries, but Coventry recovered funds from the settlement through a lien. Nevils satisfied the lien, then filed a state class action suit alleging that the Missouri law does not permit subrogation reimbursement in this context. Oral arguments were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-the-interplay-between-federal-and-state-subrogation-law.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] in this case in March. The opinion was reached by a 8-0 vote, with Justice Ginsburg writing the majority opinion and Justice Thomas filing a concurrence.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Arizona Governor<a href="http://azgovernor.gov"> Doug Doucey</a> [official profile] on Monday signed into law a "<a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/69195">Blue Lives Matter</a>" [SB 13666, text] law imposing stricter penalties on assaulting, even off duty, police officers. The bill creates new maximum and minimums for offenses against police officers and supporters of the bill, such as Sen. Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, have said it is a measure "to protect those who protect us." Opponents of the bill claim it is unnecessary as heightened sentencing schemes already exist for those who assault police officers and that it is an "inappropriate political statement that attempts to stop a problem of off-duty police officers being assaulted for their profession when there is little quantitative data that it exists." The bill is set to go into effect in the summer.</p>

<p>This bill is yet another development amid a national conversation about police use of force, particularly against black citizens, and subsequent retaliation. In the last year,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/blue-black-lives-matter-police-bills-states_us_58b61488e4b0780bac2e31b8"> 32 'Blue Lives Matter' bills have been introduced in 14 states</a> [Huffington Post report]. Last year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/texas-governor-announces-police-protection-act.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he plans to propose a law providing for additional punishment for crimes against law enforcement officers. Also, last year, Texas Senator John Cornyn introduced legislation that would elevate the penalties for killing, conspire to kill, or attempting to kill officers and judges. Additionally, North Carolina's Governor Pat McCory <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/north-carolina-governor-signs-law-requiring-a-court-order-to-obtain-police-body-camera-footage.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill providing that police camera footage, including body camera footage, is not a matter of public record and proscribes the procedure for release of footage. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed a "Blue Lives Matter" bill that<a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php"> also raises the penalties </a>[JURIST report] for crimes against police officers. Some have criticized the measures as being redundant since many laws already raise the penalties for crimes against police officers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new plaintiff <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/press-release/update-new-plaintiffs-join-crew-emoluments-suit/">joined</a> [press release] a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/storage.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/18115942/File-Stamped-First-Amended-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF]  in the  <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/pacer.php">Southern District of New York</a> [official site] Tuesday accusing the current administration of unfair business practices by violating the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) is a non profit organization who is the lead plaintiff in a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-ethics-group-files-lawsuit-claiming-trumps-businesses-violate-constitution.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that alleges foreign payments made to business associated with the current executive branch are in violation of the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#a1_sec9">Constitution</a> [text]. Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United which overseas 200 restaurant and over 25,000 employees joined the suit citing injury based on loss of business. The suit alleges the service industry is losing revenue because individuals , especially foreign dignitaries, are ably to curry favor with President if they uses his businesses. <blockquote>Now that he has been sworn into office as the 45th President of the United States, Defendant's business interests are creating countless conflicts of interest, as well as unprecedented influence by foreign governments, and have resulted and will further result in numerous violations of Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, the &#8220;Foreign Emoluments Clause,&#8221; and Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution, the&#8220;Domestic Emoluments Clause."</blockquote> The groups in the case are seeking an injunction.</p>

<p>A number of bi-partisan experts have expressed concerns over potential ethical issues being faced by Trump. In March a contracting officer from the US General Services Administration  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-agency-trump-hotel-in-old-post-office-does-not-violate-government-lease.php">sent a letter </a>[JURIST report] to Trump finding that the Trump Organization did not violate the lease it holds for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. Also in March, the New Jersey Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/new-jersey-passes-bill-requiring-presidential-disclosure-of-tax-return.php">passed S3048</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday which would require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to reveal their federal income tax return before being listed on the state's ballot. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/whitefish_complaint_finalstamped.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the founder of the website The Daily Stormer.  SPLC filed the suit on behalf of a Montana woman who <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/04/18/splc-sues-neo-nazi-leader-who-targeted-jewish-woman-anti-semitic-harassment-campaign">claims</a> [SPLC press release] to have been targeted by the website with an anti-Semitic harassment campaign.  According to the suit, the founder Andrew Anglin <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-daily-stormer-intimidation-lawsuit-20170418-story.html">published</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] over 30 articles encouraging his followings to launch a "troll storm" against the woman and her family, who claim to have received more than 700 harassing messages since December.  The lawsuit was filed in the <a href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana Missoula Division</a> [official website] and seeks compensatory and punitive damages claiming invasion of privacy as well as intentionally inflicting emotional distress.  The suit also claims that Anglin's actions violate the Montana Anti-Intimidation Act.</p>

<p>There has been an alarming rise in anti-Semitism worldwide. In February UK lawmakers stated in a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-lawmakers-urge-uk-to-take-action-against-growing-anti-semitism.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that the country needs to take action against rising anti-Semitism.  In January the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-holds-first-ever-meeting-in-response-to-anti-semitism.php">held a daylong informal meeting</a> [JURIST report] devoted to anti-Semitism in response to a global increase in violence against Jews. The meeting was requested by 37 countries in a letter to the General Assembly president in October. Also in January French police <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/french-police-arrest-54-people-for-supporting-terrorism.php">arrested 54 people</a> [JURIST report] for verbally supporting or threatening terrorist acts in the wake of the terrorist attacks at the offices of French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. Also that month a French court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/france-court-backs-ban-on-comedy-show-performance.php#.U0fty2Q6WIU">upheld the ban</a> [JURIST report] on a performance by French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala that was deemed anti-Semitic and <a href="/hotline/2013/02/felix-treguer-twitter-france.php">generated much discussion</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/remarks-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-meeting-attorney-general-s-organized-crime-council">said </a> [press release] Tuesday that the Trump administration will have "zero tolerance for gang violence" from transnational criminal organizations such as MS-13, in remarks made to the Organized Crime Council and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF). The gang <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/mara-salvatrucha-ms-13-profile">Mara Salvatrucha</a> [InSight Crime backgrounder], or MS-13, was formed in the 1980's in Los Angeles neighborhoods, and now has a prominent presence throughout many Central American countries. According to Sessions, there are over 10,000 members of MS-13 across the US. He went on to say: "Transnational criminal organizations like MS-13 represent one of the gravest threats to American safety. These organizations enrich themselves by pedaling poison in our communities, trafficking children for sexual exploitation and inflicting horrific violence in the communities where they operate."</p>

<p>Widespread violence at the hands of criminal organizations such as MS-13 has troubled Central America for years. In November 2015, a UN humans rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-urges-honduras-to-increase-efforts-to-curb-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Honduras to increase its efforts to put a stop to an "internal displacement epidemic" caused by organized and gang violence throughout the country, as well as a failing criminal justice system. Earlier that year, El Salvador's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/street-gangs-are-terrorist-groups-el-salvador-supreme-court-rules.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the country's street gangs and those who support them financially would be classified as terrorist groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1256_5i36.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nelson-v-colorado/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Nelson v. Colorado</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] on Wednesday that Colorado's <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/825B615B5119309187257A83006D046D?Open&file=1230_01.pdf">Exoneration Act</a> [text, PDF] is not in accord with the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>'s [LII, text] guarantee of due process. The Act permits Colorado to retain the fees paid in conviction-related assessments unless the exonerated defendant can prove their innocence by clear and convincing evidence in a civil suit. Colorado argued that the Act provided sufficient means for a defendant to seek compensation for the loss of liberty. This is different from most jurisdictions which automatically refund those who have been acquitted. The Court contended Colorado's argument stating, "Just as restoration of liberty on reversal of a conviction is not compensation, neither is the return of money taken by the State on account of the conviction." The Act's scheme, the Court went on, "creates an unacceptable risk of the erroneous deprivation of defendants' property."</p>

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-acquittal-refunds-tribal-immunity.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] for Nelson v. Colorado in January. <em>Certiorari</em> was granted to petitioners Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden. Nelson was convicted on two felonies and three misdemeanors in relation to the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her children. In addition to being sentenced 20 years to life, she was ordered to pay $8,192.50 in costs, fees, and restitution. Her conviction was reversed on error and upon retrial she was acquitted of all charges. Madden was imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered to pay $4,413.00 in costs, fees, and restitution. Once their convictions were overturned, both moved for return of the funds. The <a href="https://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Court_Of_Appeals/Index.cfm">Colorado Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruled that both were entitled to seek refunds. The <a href="http://www.coloradosupremecourt.com/">Colorado Supreme Court</a> [official website] reversed on the grounds that because neither petitioner filed their claim under the Exoneration Act, they were not entitled to refunds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-announces-new-actions-support-law-enforcement-and-maintain">announced </a> [press release] plans on Tuesday to implement a series of actions that will support the public safety on Native American lands. The initiative is hoped to improve relations between federal authorities and "Native America." Under the Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety three actions will be implemented to support public safety within the Indian community.  The following actions to be taken are: the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will deploy the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/tribal/tribal-access-program-tap">Tribal Access Program for National Crime Information</a> [official website] to 10 tribal sites to provide access to federal anti-crime databases, the Office of Tribal Justice will coordinate a series of listening sessions with tribal law enforcement officials and leaders to guarantee an unique perspective of law is applied within their community, and the creation of the Indian Country Federal Law Enforcement Coordination Group, comprised of 12 federal law enforcement agencies, to increase the coordination of federal agencies response to violent crime. Sessions said the need to provide tribal police with the tools to maintain public safety within their communities is paramount.</p>

<p>Tribal matters have been of increasing concern over the past year in federal courts. In March the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-rejects-tribal-land-access-lawsuit.php">rejected a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by members of a California Native American tribe over land access. That same month the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-rules-native-american-tribe-has-federally-established-rights-in-groundwater.php">has a federally established right to groundwater</a> [JURIST report] in the Coachella Valley reservation in California. Earlier this month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-allows-dakota-access-pipeline-construction-to-continue.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] against Native American tribes seeking to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In January the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-acquittal-refunds-tribal-immunity.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe bars individual-capacity damages actions tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-7250_3eb4.pdf">held</a> [opinion] on Wednesday that a defendant wishing to appeal a restitution order must file a separate motion from the notice of appeal for the judgment. The ruling came from <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/manrique-v-united-states/">Manrique v. United States</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials]. In June 2014 Manrique was sentenced to 72 months imprisonment and a life term of supervised release. Although the trial court acknowledge that restitution was necessary, they deferred determining the victim's damages until they could be properly ascertained. In the interim, the defendant <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/15-7250_5h26.pdf">appealed the conviction</a> [transcript, PDF].  The majority found that under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4">Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a> [LII, text], Manrique's appeal was not filed in a timely manner. Additionally, the court asserted that according to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_3">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1)</a> [LII, text] "will file the notice of appeal <em>after</em> the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed." Because the amount had not been decided, Manrique's appeal of the verdict did not cover the later decided amount of restitution.</p>

<p>Justice Ginsburg dissented on the grounds that "the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals." She contends that under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_32">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B)</a> [LII, text] that the District Court was required to advise Manrique on his right to appeal the restitution order. She went on to point out that "without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court." The court's transmission was "tantamount to" a second appeal notice, she said, and it should allow for Manrique to "include the restitution order in his appeal."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/18/presidential-executive-order-buy-american-and-hire-american">Presidential Executive Order on Buy American and Hire American</a> [text] on Tuesday. The order requires executive agencies to monitor and enforce Buy American Laws, which are defined as all laws that "require, or provide a preference for, the purchase or acquisition of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States, including iron, steel, and manufactured goods." Agencies also have 150 days to develop policies ensuring that federal awards and purchases are used to maximize the use of American-made products. It also tasks certain agencies with suggesting reforms to the H-1B visa program, "to help ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries."</p>

<p>This is the latest executive order signed by Trump since taking office in January. In the last month, some of Trump's presidential executive orders have addressed issues such as energy regulations, drug addiction, trade, and internet regulations. Trump signed an executive order reforming the previous administration's <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">energy policies</a> [JURIST report]. He also signed an order establishing a task force for combating drug addiction that <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">will be led</a> [JURIST report] by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. The commission will recommend efforts to more effectively battle drug addiction. Earlier this month, Trump released an executive order instructing the Commerce Department and the US Trade Representative to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-orders-study-of-us-trade-deficit-import-duty-evasion.php">study causes of the US trade deficit</a> [JURIST report]. A few days later, he signed a bill officially <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-repeals-fcc-internet-privacy-rules-requiring-consumer-consent.php">repealing</a> [JURIST report] internet privacy regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippine Senator Sherwin Gatchalian called for an investigation Wednesday into allegations made by senior officials in the Philippine National Police that officers have been offered cash rewards to execute individuals who are suspected of illegal drug activity. More than 9,000 people have died since President Duterte took office last June and the two anonymous officials <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-police-idUSKBN17L1NX">claim</a> [Reuters report] that more than a third of those deaths can be traced to police-sanctioned assassins and vigilantes. The report goes on to detail allegations that the Philippine National Police has planted evidence at crime scenes and even that police are paid to kill not just drug suspects, but also rapists, pickpockets, swindlers, gang members, alcoholics and other "troublemakers."     </p>

<p>Thousands of people have been killed in the past year since Duterte took office and began his controversial war on drugs. Numerous rights groups have been critical of the killings and have spoken out against the current administration. In March, President Duterte said he would not be <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/philippine-president-not-scared-of-potential-icc-trial-over-drug-war.php">intimidated by a potential criminal trial</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of the International Criminal Court due to his handling of the drug war and vowed that the police would continue as they have. Earlier that month, the Human Rights Watch released a report that accused the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. A policy of sanctioned killings has been a routine part of Duterte's rhetoric since is time serving as mayor of Davao. In December 2016 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">called for a murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] after Duterte admitted to killing people in his role as mayor. Duterte has seemed skeptical of the ICC before, in November he suggested that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/philippines-president-contemplating-leaving-icc.php">Philippines might leave</a> [JURIST report] the international body.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lawsuit was filed against <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html">Bose Corp.</a> [corporate website] Tuesday claiming that the sound system manufacturer was <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/345620278/Bose-Privacy-Complaint">illegally mining and distributing</a> [complaint, text] headphone users' personal data. The complaint alleges that Bose secretly collected, transmitted, and disclosed its customers' private music and audio selections to third parties and demands restitution in excess of $5,000,000. The suit centers around the app "Bose Connect" through which users of Bose headphones may pair their devices to a smartphone and access and control the headphones' settings and features. According to the complaint, Bose designed Bose Connect collect and record the titles of the music and audio files chosen to play through Bose wireless products and transmit that data along with other personal identifiers, required to sign up for Bose Connect, to third-parties without users' knowledge or consent. The complaint alleges that Bose violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119">Federal Wire Tap Act</a> [text] as well as several state anti-intrusion statutes.  </p>

<p>The increased "Internet of Things" has led to new and unique challenges to consumers who wish to maintain data privacy and the international controversy has led to involvement by many civil rights groups. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-repeals-fcc-internet-privacy-rules-requiring-consumer-consent.php">officially repealing internet privacy regulations</a> [JURIST report] set by the Federal Communications Commission during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term. Last month,  Facebook settled a class-action lawsuit levied against it for its prior <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/facebook-to-settle-in-class-action-privacy-suit.php">practice of scanning private messages</a> [JURIST report] to aid in ads. Also in March, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected the settlement of a class action lawsuit where non-Gmail email users contended that Google <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-google-e-mail-scanning-settlement.php">illegally scanned their e-mail correspondence</a> [JURIST report] with Gmail users for targeted advertising purposes. In February, the Federal Trade Commission announced a $2.2 million settlement with VIZIO over the alleged <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/vizio-to-pay-22-million-in-settlement-over-illegal-data-collection.php">collection of viewer data without consent</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Liberty, a UK-based advocacy group, announced that it had met its crowding funding goal to launch a legal challenge against recently passed surveillance legislation that <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/rights-group-launching-legal-challenge-against-uk-surveillance-law.php">allows the government to record the internet history</a> [JURIST report] of every UK citizen for up to a year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard oral arguments on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-240.htm">Weaver v. Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-577.htm">Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer</a> [dockets].  In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/weaver-v-massachusetts/">Weaver v. Massachusetts</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], the court considered <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/16-240_nkp1.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] on whether a defendant who is claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a structural error must show the they were prejudiced by the ineffectiveness.  Petitioner in this matter argued that it is an unreasonable standard for defendant's to prove actual prejudice as a result of their attorney's deficiency, asserting that when the deficiency is a result of a structural error, it is practically impossible to demonstrate the practical effects of that error.  Respondent in return argued that judgments should only be overturned in circumstances where the deficiency impacts the outcome rather than assuming prejudice and disrupting judgement that were not impacted by the error.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trinity-lutheran-church-of-columbia-inc-v-pauley/">Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], Inc. v. Comer the court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/15-577_l64n.pdf">heard arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] on whether excluding churchs from neutral aid programs violates Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses if the state does not provide a valid Establishment clause concern.  Petitioner argues that a churn run preschool being excluded from a recycling program due to their religious nature violates Free Exercise Principles by discriminating based upon religion as well as depriving religious organizations of general benefits for secular activities.  Respondent in turn argued that the majority of states have maintained a tradition of not providing government aid in regards to religion, and that such a tradition should be protected.  In essence, Respondent argues that deciding what type of activities run by religious groups can be funded by the government would lead to entanglement and establishment clause concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm">Alabama Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://acis.alabama.gov/displaydocs.cfm?no=797775&event=4WC0QWHV6">upheld</a> [order] the September 2016 <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/judiciary/judiciary.cfm">Court of the Judiciary</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/alabama-top-justice-suspended-over-gay-marriage-order.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] to suspend Chief Justice Roy Moore for violation of the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/library/rules_canons.cfm">Canons of Judicial Ethics</a> [text] by issuing orders contradicting the US Supreme Court's recognition of same-sex marriage. In January, 2015, federal judge Callie Garande <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/federal-judge-orders-alabama-official-to-issue-same-sex-marriage-licenses">issued an order</a> [Constitution Center report] ruling that Alabama's statutory proscription on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. In response, Moore issued an administrative order preventing Alabama's probate judges from issuing same-sex marriage licenses. While Garande's order was pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] recognized a fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in <u>Obergefell v. Hodges</u>. When Moore continued to attempt to restrict same-sex marriage, he was removed from duty. On the Alabama Supreme Court's decision, Moore stated, "I have done my duty under the laws of this state to stand for the undeniable truth that God ordained marriage as the union of one and one woman." Moore has expressed interest in running for Senate. </p>

<p>Justice Roy Moore <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-chief-justice-facing-suspension-over-same-sex-marriage-order.php">was suspended</a> [JURIST report] in May, 2016 after being charged with violating ethical rules. The Judicial Inquiry Commission accused Moore of failing to act impartially and refusing to follow the law when he <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/294755454/Administrative-order">ordered</a> [text, PDF] probate judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">not to issue same-sex marriage licenses</a> [JURIST report] as their issuance ran contrary to Alabama law. Moore argued that the US Supreme Court ruling only applied to the plaintiff in the case, and that probate judges in Alabama had not been ordered to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The commission stated that Moore is bound by the Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution and has violated the law. Soon after being suspended, Moore filed suit in federal court challenging the JIC's rule that any judge under investigation must be suspended. In August, the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/alabama-supreme-court-justices-suit-against-judicial-inquiry-commission-dismissed.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Moore's complaint, finding that it was not the federal court's place to intervene in issues of state constitutional law. The Supreme Court issued the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">Obergefell decision</a> [JURIST report] in June, 2015. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://ss.one.un.org/resident-coordinator">Eugene Owusu</a> [official profile], the top United Nations humanitarian official in South Sudan on Wednesday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56584#.WPgPZVPyvVo">warned</a> [UN News Centre report] that without peace in South Sudan humanitarian conditions will continue to deteriorate. Speaking to reporters, Owusu urged that women in Sudan face a daily risk of sexual assault and rape. Owusu also warned of famine, homelessness and violence. He stated, "while humanitarians will continue to do all that is possible to alleviate suffering, the fact remains that unless the guns fall silent, the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate." </p>

<p>Owusu's recent plea comes only days after he made a similar <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/south-sudan-un-official-urges-government-and-opposition-to-protect-civilians-and-aid-workers.php">plea to the government and opposition</a> [JURIST report] of South Sudan to ensure the protection of civilians and aid workers in the country. <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a> [JURIST feature], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">officially recognized</a> [JURIST report] as an independent nation in July 201, has spent much of its brief history as a nation in civil war. Earlier in April, the United Nations Refugee Agency expressed alarm at the deteriorating condition of South Sudan's security, as both governmental and opposition forces have been attacking civilians. In March, the Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-in-south-sudan.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that there is a need to establish courts and bring prosecutions against those who have committed rights abuses throughout the nation's conflicts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> [official cite] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/166/19394.pdf">rejected </a> [document, PDF] Ukraine's request for measures to prevent rebels in the country from receiving supplies over its Russian boarder. The court granted measures designed to protect ethnic discrimination in the disputed Crimean peninsula, currently under Russian rule, but did not grant Ukraine's request to prevent the funding of terrorism by implementing a number of regulations. The request sought to force the Russian state to identify potential terrorist funders by requiring banks to report suspicious activity, by monitoring cross-boarder transportation of funds, and verifying information by establishing channels of communication between analogous state agencies in Ukraine and Russia. However, the order does require Russia to ensure the teaching of the Ukrainian language in Crimea. The denial of provisional measures means there will not be a decision on the issue until the large case is resolved. </p>

<p>The situation involving Russia and Ukraine has been a source of conflict since <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA2K0MC20140321">Russia's annexation of Crimea</a> [Reuters backgrounder] in March 2014. In late March, the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php">upheld </a> [JURIST report] economic sanctions against Russia for the annexation. Before that, in January the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">General Court</a> [official website] of the EU <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/eu-court-upholds-sanctions-on-russian-arms-maker-almaz-antey.php">upheld </a>[JURIST report] the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-01/cp170006en.pdf">2014 sanctions</a> [press release] against Russian arms manufacturer <a href="http://www.almaz-antey.ru/en">Almaz-Antey</a> [corporate website]. Earlier in January Ukraine filed suit against Russia in the International Court of Justice for alleged acts of terrorism and discrimination. The case has been filed for <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/ukraine-files-case-against-russia-in-uns-highest-court.php">violations of various international conventions</a> [JURIST report]. In December the Amsterdam District Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/dutch-court-orders-crimean-artifacts-returned-to-ukraine.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that Crimean gold artifacts are to be returned to Ukraine and not Crimea. The artifacts, including gems, helmets and scabbards, were on loan to Amsterdam's Allard Pierson Museum when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy groups from around the world signed a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ASA1660692017ENGLISH.pdf">joint statement</a> [PDF] on Thursday that called for the release of all political prisoners in Myanmar. The release of the petition aligned with the third anniversary of U Win Tin's death, a political prisoner in Myanmar for close to 20 years. The 22 rights groups that signed the petition stated their goal is to create a mechanism in Myanmar that will review the detentions of prisoners and free those who have been, "deprived of their liberty simply for the peaceful exercise of their human rights or as a result of unfair, politically motivated trials." The petition argued that the Myanmar Scrutinizing Committee into the Prisoners of Conscience Affairs Committee, created in 2015 to review detentions, has disregarded its mission, refused to publish its guidelines and has never met as a 28-member body.</p>

<p>Myanmar has seen its human rights record closely monitored since 2015 when a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/myanmar-government-signs-ceasefire-deal-to-end-conflict-with-rebels.php">cease-fire agreement</a> [JURIST report] was signed by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Sein</a> [BBC profile]. The agreement established an uneasy peace between the government and various rebel groups. In March the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-independent-investigation-into-myanmar-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar to investigate alleged rights violations against the Rohingya Muslim population committed in Myanmar. In April 2016 the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/myanmar-releases-political-prisoners.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 69 students who had been held for more than a year without trial because of protests asking for more academic freedom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/venezuela-inagotable-ciclo-de-violencia-y-represion-amenaza-vida-de-la-poblacion/">called for</a> [press release] police restraint on Wednesday to protect protesters' rights in Venezuela. Protests continue in the country against <a href="http://www.nicolasmaduro.org.ve/biografia/#.WPjdSVPyuLJ">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official profile, in Spanish], and hundreds of thousands of people held rival protests on Wednesday amid rising political tensions in the country. It was reported that Venezuelan police fired tear gas at the anti-government demonstrators who accused the President of moving towards a dictatorship and called for his resignation. On Tuesday evening, the government activated the "Plan Zamora," a security mechanism calling for the deployment of civilians to fight alongside police and military forces to "preserve public order." Directer at AI, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2013/09/amnesty-international-welcomes-new-americas-director/">Erika Guevara-Rosas</a> [background], stated that the 'Plan Zamora' may lead to human rights abuses at the hands of armed civilian groups. AI urged Venezuelan authorities to allow citizens to peacefully voice their opinion and to investigate all reports of human rights abuses committed during the protests.</p>

<p>Instability in Venezuela peaked on March 30 when the <a href="http://www.tsj.gob.ve/inicio">Supreme Court of Venezuela</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers. In January 2016, Venezuela's <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/noticia/show/id/13968">swore in</a> [press release, in Spanish] three opposition deputies despite a Supreme Court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] the induction of the elected lawmakers. The ruling also suspended four elected lawmakers for alleged election fraud in the December sixth elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Uruguayan House of Senators <a href="https://parlamento.gub.uy/noticiasyeventos/noticias/node/87016">approved </a> [press release] a <a href="https://parlamento.gub.uy/camarasycomisiones/senadores/actividad?FechaHora%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=17-04-2017&FechaHora%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=20-05-2017&Tipo=All">bill </a> [materials] on Tuesday that would make femicide an explicit criminal offense of its own. The legislation is being passed to the House of Representatives for further approval. The bill would codify femicide as a very special aggravating circumstance to homicide, which could increase the sentence imposed upon a conviction. The purpose of the bill is to be accomplished by amending articles 311 and 312 of the <a href="https://parlamento.gub.uy/documentosyleyes/codigos?page=1">penal code</a> [materials]. </p>

<p>Violence against women continues to be an area of focus for human rights groups. Last month the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">urged </a> [JURIST report] the government of Australia to include all women in the fight to stop violence against women.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey's <a href="http://www.justice.gov.tr/Ministry/Minister/index.html">Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ</a> [official profile] said on Thursday that the <a href="http://constitutionalcourt.gov.tr/">Turkish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] would reject any opposition challenge to a referendum that expanded President <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/">Recep Tayyip Erdogan's</a> [official website] powers, and the <a href="http://echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] had no jurisdiction on the matter. The referendum was approved on Sunday after a 51 percent victory in favor of expanding President Tayyipp Erdogan's powers. The changes, which will not come into effect until 2019, would <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-voters-approve-referendum-to-increase-presidential-powers.php">abolish</a> [JURIST report] the position of prime minister and give the president powers formerly granted to Parliament. Many <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-04-20/turkish-minister-says-echr-has-no-jurisdiction-over-referendum">opposing</a> [Reuter's report] the referendum called for a recount because election authorities made a last minute decision to allow unstamped ballots to be counted. The Republican People's party (CHP) is the main opposition to the passage of the referendum. The CHP stated on Wednesday that it wanted to appeal to the Constitutional Court or the ECHR.</p>

<p>Since the failed coup in Turkey in July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. Last month the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-reports-recent-human-rights-violations-in-southern-turkey.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] describing a plethora of human rights violations committed by the Turkish government between July 2015 and December 2016. Also last month around 330 individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for alleged involvement in the attempted coup. In November Turkey significantly restricted the activities of NGOs like human rights organizations and children's groups and <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested opposition party leaders</a> [JURIST report] alleging they were connected to terror organizations. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-turkish-emergency-decrees-permitting-government-sanctioned-torture.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the emergency decrees put in place after the failed coup, had resulted in serious human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday law firm <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/">Hagens Berman</a> [corporate website] filed a class action <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/tesla_ap2/teslaclassactioncomplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">California's Northern District Court</a> [official website] against car company <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> [official website] over the self driving function in their vehicles. The lawsuit alleges that the autopilot function is "essentially unusable and demonstrably dangerous" and places the car users at risk. The new hardware system, AutoPilot2, is alleged to not live up to standard safety features and was rolled out with defects. Tesla responded in a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-autopilot-2-2017-4">statement</a> [Business Insider report] that the lawsuit misrepresents many different facts. The company stated, "we have never claimed our vehicles already have functional full self-driving capability". Tesla also says that the autopilot software is being rolled out in a safe fashion and is subject to government regulation. </p>

<p>Driverless vehicles are emerging on the market ever more presently, which opens the new technology to regulation and legal challenges. JURIST Guest Columnist John Terwilleger, of Gunster, discusses <a href="/hotline/2017/01/John-Terwilleger-autonomous-vehicles.php">the development and regulation</a> [JURIST op-ed] of "driverless" vehicles and how federal and state governments are addressing this emerging technology. The introduction of these technologies continue to be under immense scrutiny, especially when there is an accident involving one of these vehicles. Tesla has already had a challenge after one of its vehicles was in an accident that led to a death. An <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/tesla-model-s-autopilot-fatal-crash.html">investigation</a> [NYT report] into the matter found that there was no defect in the auto-pilot system in the vehicle and that they did not to be recalled.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Pakistan Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/Const.P._29_2016.pdf">rejected calls</a> [opinion, PDF] on Thursday to disqualify <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official website] from office stating that there was insufficient evidence concerning the corruption allegations against Sharif and his family to constitutionally compel his removal from office. The court presented a 549-page split judgment with two of the five justices dissenting. The dissenting justices stated that Sharif should be forced to resign for lying to the electorate and the legislative body of Pakistan. The court ordered an investigative team to look further into Shariff's family and gave it two months to report to a special bench to review the proceedings. Political analysts state that the ruling is a <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/pakistan-politics-ruling-idINKBN17M109">blow to Sharif's credibility</a> [Reuters report], despite the favorable judgment, and that the investigation's findings may weaken Sharif's chances at getting reelected.</p>

<p>Pakistan's current government has been under scrutiny in the last few months both on a domestic and international context. Last week a Pakistan military court sentenced <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav-the-hindu-explains/article17907888.ece">Kulbushan Jadhav</a> [The Hindu backgrounder], an Indian naval officer who was detained in Pakistan for the past year, to death. The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php">handed down</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence after finding Jadhav guilty of espionage and sabotage. India stated that the sentence would amount to the "premeditated murder" of an Indian national by the Pakistan. Last month the Pakistan National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/pakistan-assembly-votes-to-continue-use-of-military-courts-on-terrorism-suspects.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to renew an amendment to the country's constitution that allows military tribunals to oversee civilians accused of terrorist-related crimes. Advocacy groups including  <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/20/pakistan-dont-reinstate-secret-military-courts">called</a> [press release] on Pakistan to end the use of military court on civilians, saying it violates the the rule of law and creates human rights abuses. Also last month Sharif <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/pakistan-pm-blasphemy-on-social-media-must-be-punished.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that blasphemy is an "unpardonable offense" and ordered the state to remove such content from social media. In a Twitter post through the <a href="http://pmln.org/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> [official website] Twitter account, Sharif directed Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan to bring to justice all those who have posted blasphemous comments. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/index.php">Russia Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on Thursday granted the Russian government's request to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses religious group. The court ruled that the group is an "extremist organization" and <a href="http://tass.com/world/942396">outlawed their activities</a> [TASS report] in the entire country. As part of the decision, the group's assets will be seized and turned into state property. The <a href="http://government.ru/en/department/99/events/">Russian Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-top-court-hears-bid-to-outlaw-jehovahs-witnesses.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the group's practice of passing out pamphlets incites hatred against other groups and violates anti-extremist legislation, and the court agreed. The full text of the ruling will be made available to the parties in the case within five days.</p>

<p>Russia's human rights and religious freedom record has been the subject of widespread international criticism. In February the Russian Supreme Court annulled the 2.5 year prison sentence of Ildar Dadin, who was the first person to be convicted under a relatively <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-highest-court-releases-political-activist.php">new anti-protest law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in February the European Court of Human Rights ordered Russia to pay more than 63,000 euros for <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">arresting Alexander Navalny multiple times</a> [JURIST report] between March 2012 and February 2014. The court held that Russia repeatedly and unjustifiably violated Navalny's right to freedom of peaceful assembly under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-sanctions-five-russian-officials-for-human-rights-abuses.php">sanctioned</a> [JURIST report] five Russian officials for human rights abuses in association with the death of a lawyer in prison. The Russian Foreign Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/russia-announces-intentions-to-leave-icc.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in November that Russia would leave the International Criminal Court (ICC), expressing disdain over the ICC's investigation into potential human rights abuses by Russian forces in South Ossetia in 2008. In May 2015 Russian President Vladmir Putin <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/russia-president-signs-restrictive-law-against-undesirable-ngos.php">signed a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows for foreign "undesirable" NGOs or firms to be sanctioned and banned from operating in the country, drawing criticism from human rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] on Thursday formally <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/news-pubs/sjc/sjc-dismisses-thousands-of-cases-affected-by-hinton-state-laboratory-breach.html">approved the dismissal</a> [press release] of over 21,000 drug convictions that were <a href="https://aclum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017_04_19-SJ-2014-0005-DECLARATORY-JUDGMENT-Gaziano-J..pdf">deemed</a> [order, PDF] to be "tainted" by a former state chemist's misconduct.  This action has been <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-than-21000-drug-convictions-officially-thrown-out-after-chemists-tampering/">deemed</a> [CBS News report] "the single largest dismissal of convictions in U.S. history.  The action by the court comes after seven district attorneys submitted <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/drug-lab-cases.html">21,587 cases</a> [materials] they would be unwilling or unable to prosecute should new trials be ordered.  These cases were brought to the court's attention after former state chemist Annie Dookhan was charged with tampering with evidence and falsifying drug tests.  Dookhan has admitted to only testing a fraction of her samples and listing all results as positive for illegal drugs in an attempt to improve her productivity and reputation.  Dookhan worked at Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston for nine years, testing over 60,000 drug samples involving roughly 34,000 defendants.  Many of the defendant's in the Dookhan cases have already served their sentence, however 2,000 cases had been <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/docs/sjc/docs/sj-2017-m008-special-master-report.pdf">resolved</a> [materials] before the court's order on Thursday and nearly 200 inmates were released from prison after Dookhan's arrest.</p>

<p>The Supreme Judicial Court <a href="https://aclum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20170118_Bridgeman_SJC_Decision.pdf">ordered</a> [order, PDF] the various district attorneys to produce of list of cases where they were willing to reprosecute and those which they would dismiss.  Beyond the over 21,000 cases likely to be dismissed, another 500 to 700 convictions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/chemist-drug-cases-dismissal.html">would most likely not be vacated</a> [NYT report].  The ACLU and Committee for Public Counsel Services has <a href="https://aclum.org/cases-briefs/bridgeman-v-district-attorney-for-suffolk-county/">stated</a> [ACLU case materials] that any "Dookhan defendants" will receive mailings informing them of the status of their case.  During her trial, Dookhan regularly stated she performed the misconduct due to her wish to be seen as the best chemist and for no other reason.  Dookhan was sentenced to served three to five years in prison and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/04/12/annie-dookhan-key-figure-state-lab-scandal-released-from-prison/lp7q98UmWKucv4F7O3R4DI/story.html">granted parole</a> [Boston Globe report] in 2016.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state of Arkansas on Thursday held the <a href="http://adc.arkansas.gov/executions">execution</a> [materials] of Ledell Lee, the first in the state in 11 years. The sentence was carried out following the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042017zr5_ebfi.pdf">denial</a> [text, PDF] earlier that day by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] of a petition to stay the execution. The court also <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042017zr3_ap6c.pdf">denied petitions and the writ of certiorari</a> [text, PDF] filed on behalf of Lee and seven other death row inmates. Lee is the first of eight Arkansas inmates awaiting executions who was put to death as part of the state's original plan to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-arkansas-execution-idUSKBN17N1IO">execute all eight within a span of 11 days</a> [Reuters report]. The 11-day execution timetable prompted severe backlash from inmates' lawyers and advocacy groups who termed the plan as "an unseemly rush that offended standards of decency." While <a href="https://arkansasag.gov/">Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://arkansasag.gov/media-center/news-releases/rutledge-statement-following-the-execution-of-inmate-ledell-lee/">statement</a> [text] characterizing the execution as bringing closure to Reese's family, Lee had consistently maintained his innocence for years and was seeking DNA tests to prove the same. </p>

<p>Last week Judge Kristine Baker of the <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-execution-plan.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking Arkansas' plan to execute seven of the inmates by the end of the month. Two days earlier <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/amnesty-calls-for-arkansas-to-stop-executions.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for Arkansas to halt the execution of the eight death row prisoners. Death penalty has been a highly divisive and controversial national issue in the past few decades. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT5057402017ENGLISH.PDF">annual report</a> [PDF], released earlier this month, revealed the US to be the only executioner in the 35 members of the Organization of American States. In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [Opinion, text], that the execution of the "mentally retarded" is excessive under the Eighth Amendment and the Constitution "places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life" of such offender. In March the Mississippi House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That same month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-death-row-inmate-over-racial-bias.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a death row inmate seeking a new sentencing hearing based on racial bias caused by his ineffective counsel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A special federal judicial panel in the US District Court for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx"> Western District of Texas </a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Perez_OrderonPlanH283_04.20.17.pdf"> ruled </a> [order, PDF] that the redistricting plan adopted by the Texas legislature was drawn to deliberately diminish the influence of the growing Latino voting population. The panel, comprised of US District Judges Xavier Rodriguez and Orlando Garcia and 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith, ruled 2-1, with Judge Smith dissenting in the opinion. Specifically, this panel <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Perez_FactFinding_04.20.17.pdf"> found </a> [fact-findings, PDF] that the map was drawn in order to protect incumbent Republican candidates by drawing an electoral map that did not create any new minority opportunity districts or enhance minority voting strength. The newly redrawn boundaries achieved their goals by fragmenting Latino populations into multiple districts or putting them all in one district to reduce their overall voting power. Some of Texas' largest cities were included in this boundary-drawing controversy, including Dallas, San Antonio, and Houston.</p>

<p>Issues of gerrymandering and voting rights have become increasingly prevalent over the the past year. This decision comes after a similar court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-texas-guilty-of-illegally-drawing-voting-districts.php"> ruled </a> [JURIST report] that the boundaries of three voting districts in Texas violated the <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=100&page=transcript"> Voting Rights Act </a> and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv"> Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution </a> [texts] by discriminating against Latino voters. Earlier in March, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php"> ruled </a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias. Additionally, in January, a three-judge panel for the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-orders-lawmakers-to-redraw-district-lines.php"> ordered the state legislature </a> [JURIST report] to redraw legislative district lines by November 1. Earlier in January, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-ordering-special-elections-in-north-carolina.php"> blocked </a> [JURIST report] a ruling ordering the redrawing of the congressional district map and special elections to be held in North Carolina. This came after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-two-racial-gerrymandering-cases.php"> heard arguments </a> [JURIST report] in racial gerrymandering cases from Virginia and North Carolina in December. In September, several organizations filed a federal lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/georgia-voter-registration-system-challenged-by-federal-lawsuit.php"> challenging Georgia's voter registration system </a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Seven human rights organizations, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], on Thursday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/21/equatorial-guinea-free-human-rights-defenders">denounced</a> [press release] the government of Equatorial Guinea for arresting Enrique Asumu and Alfredo Okenve, activists who lead the <a href="http://www.ceidge.org/">Center for Development Studies and Initiatives (CEID)</a> [advocacy site; Spanish].  Government authorities barred the organization's president, Asumu, from boarding a plane.  When Asumu and vice-president Okenve met with the security minister the next day, the minister interrogated them and then detained them at the police station.  The government had ordered the organization to halt its activities in March of 2016.  Human rights organizations are upset about the violation of the laws of Equatorial Guinea, which require those arrested to be brought before a judge within 24 hours and formally charged within 72 hours.  Tutu Alicante, executive director of the human rights organization <a href="http://www.egjustice.org/">EG Justice</a> [advocacy website], said "The authorities have a long history of harassing, arbitrarily detaining, and generally interfering with the work of human rights defenders in Equatorial Guinea....  This latest incident shows the authorities' willingness to trample on the country's due process laws to intimidate and silence dissent."  </p>

<p>This is not the first issue in Equatorial Guinea that has drawn concern from human rights groups.  In 2011 Human Rights Watch and EG Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/rights-groups-claim-voter-fraud-in-equatorial-guinea-referendum.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] voter fraud in Equatorial Guinea.  Amnesty International condemned the government for the execution of four men <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/equatorial-guinea-defends-executions-over-2009-coup-plot.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of an attempted assassination on President Obiang in 2009.  Obiang <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/equatorial-guinea-president-says-coup-plotters-had-fair-trial.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the decision, stating that no laws were broken and all necessary legal procedures were followed.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us">UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a> [official website], Babar Baloch, said in a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2017/4/58f9c8654/kasai-violence-drives-11000-congolese-seek-refuge-angola.html">press release</a> [text] on Friday that over 11,000 refugees from the Kasai province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have recently escaped to Angola due to violence in their province.  Refugees say that they are targeted by militia groups who believe the refugees are supporting the government.  Violence in the province between government and militia groups began almost one year ago.  Many of the refugees arriving in Dundo, Angola are ill from conditions relating to malnutrition.  Baloch says the UNHCR is working with the DRC's government as well as shipping mosquito netting and other supplies to Dundo.  "The new arrivals are terrified and still fear for their lives and mentioned they do not have any immediate plans to return home," said Baloch.  </p>

<p>The DRC has seen ongoing violence for the past several decades, which has led to growing international concern.  Earlier this month the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/icc-violence-in-drc-could-be-war-crimes.php">said</a> [JURIST report] violence in the DRC could constitute war crimes. In March seven army officials were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/congo-soldiers-arrested-for-alleged-role-in-february-massacre.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes. In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-calls-on-drc-to-investigate-alleged-killings-by-soldiers.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the DRC to investigate the killing of alleged militia which was recorded in a released video. Earlier in February the UN human rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-human-rights-commissioner-urges-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-to-halt-violence-against-civilia.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the DRC to end violence against civilians. Also in February the UN human rights office expressed <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-office-condemns-civilian-deaths-in-congo.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that at least 101 people were killed by Congolese soldiers. Last October violent protests <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/drc-elections-pushed-back-to-2018.php">erupted</a> [JURIST report] after the electoral commission announced that the next presidential election, originally scheduled for November 2016, would be pushed back to 2018.  In the beginning of <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/drc-elections-pushed-back-to-2018.php">2016</a> [JURIST report] former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon urged African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to "cling to power."<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">UK Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dangerous-extremists-to-be-separated-from-mainstream-prison-population">announced</a> [press release] on Friday plans to separate 28 "dangerous extremist" from the main stream prison population by placing them in one of three separation centers. Prisoners who are subject to separation are those who were involved in planning terrorism or are considered to pose a risk to national security. Prime Minister Sam Gyimah has stated that the centers are necessary to combat extremism in prison and to limit the influence of extremists on other prisoners. Prisoners who are in the centers will undergo a review by experts every three months. They can be returned to the general prison population if it is determined that their risk can be effectively managed in the prisons. The first center will be established in the next few weeks at HMP Frankland. The ministry says the centers are the latest part of the UK's extremism strategy. Other steps include new training materials to prison officials, the formation of the Security, Order, and Counter-Terrorism directorate, a new intelligence unit for prisons, and banning extremist literature from prisons. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dutch timber trader Guus Kouwenhoven <a href="http://deeplink.rechtspraak.nl/uitspraak?id=ECLI:NL:GHSHE:2017:1760">was sentenced</a> [ruling, in Dutch] to 19 years in prison by an <a href="https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Rechtbanken/Rechtbank-Oost-Brabant">appellate court in Den Bosch</a> [official website] on Friday after he was found guilty of smuggling weapons into Liberia during that country's civil war. Kouwenhoven, who has denied wrongdoing, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/dutch-court-overturns-conviction-of.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of violating an embargo related to the arms-dealing in 2006. That conviction was overturned in 2008. Kouwenhoven ran two timber companies at the time, which he used to smuggle weapons to then-President of Liberia Charles Taylor, as well as various rebel groups, according to the court. </p>

<p>Liberia continues to be in the headlines for alleged and proven war crimes spanning a number of decades. Last April a 49-year old Liberian national and resident of East Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, Mohammed Jabbateh, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/alleged-liberian-war-criminal-detained-by-federal-authorities-in-pennsylvania.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] on two counts of immigration fraud and two counts of perjury for failing to disclose his crimes in Liberia when he applied for political asylum. As recently as September 2013, the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/charles-taylors-50-year-sentence-upheld-on-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> by former Liberian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2963086.stm">Charles Taylor</a> [BBC profile; <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=charles%20taylor&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">JURIST news archive</a>] of his convictions for war crimes committed during the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone. In February 2010 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/liberia-reconciliation-efforts-must.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] that reconciliation in Liberia hinges on the development of its national security and its legal institutions. A UN report issued in April 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/liberia-facing-poor-human-rights.php">examined</a> [JURIST report] Liberia's struggles with corruption in its criminal justice system, poor detention conditions, and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and forced marriage. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Internet services were <a href="http://crtv.cm/fr/nouvelles/top-news-24/rgions-du-nord-ouest-et-du-sud-ouest-les-connexions-internet-sont-rtablies--19138.htm">returned</a> [CRTV report, in French] to two areas of Cameroon with English-speaking populations on Friday following a three-month shutdown, according to a state-run radio report. President Paul Biya had restricted Internet services in Northwest and Southwest regions of the country following violent, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cameroon-protests-idUSKBN15P2NU">sometimes deadly</a> [Reuters report], confrontations between English-speaking protesters and government officials in the mostly French-speaking African country. Restoration of the Internet follows condemnation over the shutdown from international human rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/cameroon/report-cameroon/">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://internetwithoutborders.org/fr/open-letter-to-cameroonian-government-on-internet-connectivity-in-anglophone-regions/">Internet Without Borders</a> [advocacy websites]. Cameroon Communications Director Issa Tchiroma Bakari said the Internet was being restored because the shutdown was no longer necessary, but the restrictions could be reimposed if protests continue. <blockquote>The Government urges the populations of these Regions to be vigilant in order to continue to block the way for the extremists, secessionists and enemies of the Republic. It is understood that the Government of the Republic reserves the right to take, as necessary, appropriate measures to prevent the Internet from being used again to incite hatred and discord between Cameroonians or to create public order.</blockquote>The shutdown began January 17, leading a UN human rights expert to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-experts-urge-cameroon-to-restore-internet-to-english-speaking-population.php">refer to the situation</a> [JURIST report] as "an appalling violation of their right to freedom of expression." The growing rift between the French and English speaking populations comes at a time when Cameroon faces many problems resulting from their military conflict with the terrorist group Boko Haram. Last July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-cameroon-authorities-violating-basic-human-rights-in-boko-haram-crackdown.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] on numerous human rights violations by Cameroon authorities as the country fights the insurgency of the Islamic extremist group. Cameroon's harsh practices have come in response to atrocities committed by Boko Haram which, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">report</a> [JURIST report] last September by AI, is accountable for the death of at least 400 civilians in Northern Cameroon. The militant Islamic group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] and other advocacy groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/20/joint-letter-united-nations-secretary-general-re-arbitrary-detention-torture-and">urged </a> [press release] UN Secretary General on Thursday to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter about 100 gay and bisexual men have been detained, went missing, were tortured, or were murdered under the authority of Chechen officials. The advocacy groups asked the UN Secretary General to make contact with Russian officials to end violations against men who may or may not be apart of the LGBT community, take measures to have all detainees released from detention camps, provide support for those illegally detained, and investigate those accountability for these violations. According to the groups, those who are perceived to be apart of the LGBT community in Chechnya remain in great risk of being murdered, tortured, beaten, illegally detained, or otherwise stripped of their rights until the UN steps in.</p>

<p>News of the conditions faced by those perceived to apart of the LGBT community in Chechnya was first reported by <em><a href="http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/novaya_gazeta_-_unofficial_translation.pdf">Novaya Gazeta</a></em> [report, translated]. Earlier in April, Chechen authorities have denied that gay people live in Chechnya, which is concerning to UN experts. In July, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-human-rights-council-votes-to-appoint-expert-on-lgbt-rights.php">voted in favor of</a> [JURIST report] appointing an independent expert to report on and investigate worldwide violence and discrimination against the LGBT community. Since then, UN human rights expert have provided reports of other countries dictating their discriminatory policies against the LGBT community, such as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-expert-urges-end-to-lgbt-violence-and-discrimination.php">report </a> [JURIST report] conduct in Thailand in November. That same month, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-experts-concern-grows-over-attempted-block-of-lgbt-rights-monitor.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over countries attempting to retroactively block a mandate of an independent expert to investigate sexual orientation and gender identity-based rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">US Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/04/21/197216/fda-finalizes-refusal-to-give-texas-execution-drug-shipment/">finalized</a> [Houston Public Media report] their decision on Thursday to not allow the Texas prison officials to receive a shipment of lethal injection drugs that were originally seized in July 2015. The FDA filed their decision with the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website].  The shipment contained 1000 vials of sodium thiopental. State law allows Texas to withhold the identity of the supplier of the drug. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has called the seizure unjustified. The FDA has stated that the drugs were misbranded and unapproved new drugs. The drugs are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-execution-drugs-idUSL8N1HS7BO">believed</a> [Reuters report] to be from India and were also meant to be used in Arizona.</p>

<p>The death penalty continues to be a point of contention across the United States. In March nine Arkansas death row inmates <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-death-row-inmates-sue-governor-to-halt-executions.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a suit to stop their execution. In February the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. In November the legal status of the death penalty was <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/voters-in-three-states-reaffirm-death-penalty.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by state referendum in Oklahoma, Nebraska and California. In September executions in Oklahoma were put on a two-year hiatus so Oklahoma can reevaluate its lethal injection <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/oklahoma-executions-stayed-until-agreement-reached-on-new-procedures.php">procedures</a> [JURIST report] following a botched execution and several drug mix-ups in the past two years. In December a report by the Death Penalty Information Center found that the use of capital punishment in the US is at a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">20-year low</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Governor <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/about-the-governor/governor-mcauliffe/">Terry McAuliffe</a> [official profile] <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=20103">commuted</a> [press release] a death row inmate's sentence on Thursday stating the conviction was flawed. Ivan Teleguz was sentenced to death for the murder of his ex-girlfriend in 2001. McAuliffe stayed the execution of Telequz concerned that false evidence may have influenced the conviction. During the trial, the prosecution submitted evidence that Telequz was involved in another murder and that he is a member of the Russian mafia, both allegations were later disproved. Telequz's attorney also provided evidence that testimonies provided during the trial were later recanted. As a response, the governor reduced his sentence to life in prison without parole. However, McAuliffe refuses to completely overturn the conviction as, in his judgment, there is still a great deal of reliable evidence that supports Telequz's conviction.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Earlier this week Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/amnesty-calls-for-arkansas-to-stop-executions.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for Arkansas to halt the execution of eight death row prisoners. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF], released earlier this month, revealed the US to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZO.html"><em>Atkins v. Virginia</em></a> [opinion], that the execution of the "mentally retarded" is excessive under the Eighth Amendment and the Constitution "places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life" of such offender. In March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">blocked </a>[JURIST report] Ohio's lethal injection protocol by deeming it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That same month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-death-row-inmate-over-racial-bias.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] in favor of a death row inmate seeking a new sentencing hearing based on racial bias caused by his ineffective counsel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Roman Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/russian-hacker-roman-seleznev-sentenced-27-years-170422053546136.html">sentenced</a> [Aljazeera report] on Friday for hacking into more than 500 US businesses, stealing then selling millions of credit card numbers. Seleznev was sentenced to 27 years, the longest-ever sentence for such a crime, and ordered to pay nearly $170 million in restitution. US District Judge <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/judges/jones-chambers">Richard Jones</a> [official profile] took no leniency on Seleznev, despite Seleznev's pleas for mercy. After sentencing, Seleznev's lawyer read a politically-charged statement: <blockquote>This decision made by the United States government clearly demonstrates to the entire world that I'm a political prisoner, I was kidnapped by the US Now they want to send a message to the world using me as a pawn. This message that the US is sending today is not the right way to show Vladimar Putin of Russia, or any government in this world how justice works in a democracy. </blockquote> </p>

<p>Seleznev was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/russian-hacker-arrested-computer-hacking-scheme-victimized-thousands-credit-card">indicted</a> [press release] in 2011, a sealed indictment that was unsealed in 2014 when the Russian citizen was found in Maldives and arrested in Guam. Seleznev's 2014 arrest prompted JURIST Guest Columnist Arkady Bukh to <a href="/hotline/2014/08/arkady-bukh-cyber-crime.php">question</a> [JURIST op-ed] whether the country in which a cybercrime originates have sole jurisdiction over the act and the person committing the crime, or can countries whose citizens have been harmed by the crime, in this instance hacking, bring the criminal to justice? With Seleznev's conviction, the United States' answer is that the harmed citizens retain jurisdiction. While Seleznev questioned the US' commitment to human rights, Russia has been criticized for its own humanitarian controversies, most recently embodied in the Russian Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-top-court-bans-jehovahs-witnesses.php">grant</a> [JURIST report] of the Russian government's request to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses religious group. The court ruled that the group is an "extremist organization" and outlawed their activities in the entire country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna on Wednesday charged 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the <a href="http://www.placng.org/new/laws/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20%28Prohibition%29%20Act,%202013.pdf">Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act</a> [text]. The men were arrested last Saturday, and were released on bail after sentencing. The defendants claim they were at a birthday party, not a wedding, and various human rights groups have come out in their defense. Maria Sjodin, deputy executive director of LGBTQ advocacy group <a href="https://www.outrightinternational.org/">OutRight Action International</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/53-arrested-nigeria-celebrating-gay-wedding-police-n748931">said</a> [NBC report] she believes the wedding story is an excuse for Nigerian police to "crackdown on an emerging LGBTQ movement," adding that "the police are using the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act as an excuse for mass arrests, maybe even as a way to get bribes." The men have pled not guilty. </p>

<p>LGBTQ rights have become controversial in recent years. Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter about 100 gay and bisexual men have been detained, went missing, were tortured, or were murdered under the authority of Chechen officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US on Saturday expressed its intention to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39676947">honor a migrant resettlement plan</a> [BBC News report] negotiated between the US and Australia. Under the terms of the agreement, up to 1,250 migrants seeking asylum in Australia will be allowed to resettle in the US, in return for the Australian government's pledge to resettle migrants from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador seeking asylum in the US. Though <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice-president-pence">Vice President Mike Pence</a> [official profile] re-upped the US's commitment to the plan, he said the administration would be doing so reluctantly. In addition, White House officials have said any asylum seekers coming through the plan will face "extreme vetting," a policy advanced by the Trump administration with respect to refugees seeking asylum from certain Muslim-majority countries. Many of those asylum seekers who have been denied access to Australia, primarily men from Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq, are settled outside of the country in Nauru, Cambodia, or Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p>Australian refugees and their treatment have been a topic of discussion among international human rights organizations as of late. In August, Australia <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-announces-plans-to-close-detention-center-on-manus-island.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Australia and Papua New Guinea intended on closing the controversial Manus Island detention center. That same month Amnesty International (AI) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-ignoring-inhumane-treatment-of-refugees-to-deter-others-report.php">issued reports</a> [JURIST report] stating that Australia is ignoring inhumane treatment of detainees in Nauru. In May, Papua New Guinea officials stated Australian refugees are <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">not being detained</a> [JURIST report] on Manus Island, as they are given access to mainland Australia, although refugee advocates believe that the refugees are facing arbitrary restrictions to the mainland. The statement by officials followed a ruling by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court that the Australian off-shore detention facility was illegal, in direct opposition to a February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the Australian Supreme Court earlier that found the off-shore detention to be legal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Thursday entered an order that stripped an Egyptian-born man of his  <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/al-dahab-ruling.pdf">naturalized US citizenship</a> [opinion, PDF] for lying during his naturalization process. The US government had claimed that Khaled Abu al-Dahab was a senior officer of the al-Qaeda network and operated an al-Qaeda communications hub from his apartment in California. The government described in detail his connection to terrorism in the <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Abu-al-Dahab-Complaint.pdf">original complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] and in the <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Abu-al-Dahab-Motion-for-Summary-Judgment.pdf">motion for summary judgement</a> [motion, PDF]. Judge Beryl Howell granted the motion, basing his decision solely on the fact that al-Dahab had willfully and materially lied during his naturalization process. Judge Howell determined that al-Dahab had lied about his prior marriages, his traveling before applying for naturalization and that al-Dahab had represented himself as being a US citizen in the past and had denied it on his application. </p>

<p>The <a href="/forum/2017/03/Laurie-Blank-self-defense.php">US campaign against al-Qaeda</a> [JURIST commentary] and affiliates has been ongoing since the September 11, 2001 attack on the New York City World Trade Center. In March, the US conducted airstrikes against al-Qaeda targets in Yemen. Also in March, al-Qaeda member Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Harun was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/confirmed-al-qaeda-member-convicted-of-terrorism-in-new-york-court.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on federal terrorism charges for his involvement in the deaths of US servicemen in Afghanistan. In 2015 a US Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-conviction-of-former-al-qaeda-media-director.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of al-Qaeda member Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, because conspiracy was not a war crime for which Bahlul could be tried by a military commission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2017-04-22/joint-statement-signing-new-un-world-bank-framework-build">announced a partnership</a> [joint statement] on Saturday to build resilience for the most vulnerable of the world. This effort will focus on "reducing poverty, promoting shared prosperity, enhancing food security and sustaining peace in crisis-affected situations." The partnership builds on collaboration between the two organizations over the last decade and is an update of their common <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTLICUS/Resources/UN-WBFramework.pdf">framework</a> [text, PDF] signed in 2008. According to the statement, the renewed framework comes in response to an increase in violent conflicts that have made the world more vulnerable. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56608#.WPzEgmdFfIU">has estimated</a> [UN News report] that humanitarian assistance will cost $22 billion in 2017, an increase of $9 billion since 2012. The framework is focused on innovative humanitarian aide and will introduce a more data-driven approach. Concrete areas of cooperation include coordinating support in crisis situations, the development of joint analyses and assessments and leveraging existing financing and comparative advantages. </p>

<p>The UN and World Bank are reacting to a spike in violent conflicts around the world. In March the UN called for an <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-right-chief-calls-for-a-cease-fire-in-yemen.php">immediate ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] in the Yemen war, after over 13,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the last two years. Also in March, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-more-drc-refugees-migrating-to-angola-to-escape-violence.php">warned of violence</a> [JURIST report] in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where fighting between government and militia groups began almost one year ago. The UN also warned that <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-office-urges-protection-of-civilians-in-libya-conflict.php">civilians were being targeted</a> [JURIST report] during the conflict between Libyan National Army and the Benghazi Defence Brigade in Libya in March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/content/united-states-district-judge-alfred-h-bennett">US District Judge Alfred H. Bennett</a> [official website] on Saturday said he was considering initiating an <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-04-22/judge-mulls-review-in-lawsuit-over-disabled-voter-access">independent review</a> [AP report] of disabled voter access to polling locations in Houston. The judge's consideration comes as part of a lawsuit filed against Harris County in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website], which alleged the county failed to provide voting sites in compliance with the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text], in violation of the Constitution. Among the factors allegedly contributing to the equal protection claim are the failure of Harris County to provide handicap parking, ramps, sidewalks and other accommodations for disabled citizens. According to Judge Bennett, the contemplated oversight will likely include a site-by-site examination of each polling place. </p>

<p>Voting rights continue to be a pressing issue. Earlier in March a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-texas-guilty-of-illegally-drawing-voting-districts.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the boundaries of three voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Also in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias. In February the state of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/georgia-settles-lawsuit-over-voter-restriction-law.php">settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Secretary of State Brian Kemp over a voter registration law that would reject any application that did not exactly match personal identification information in state and federal databases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Sicily prosecutor accuses NGOs of collaboration with Libya smugglers</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sicilian prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro stated to reporters on Sunday that an investigation has revealed evidence of direct contacts between some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human traffickers in Libya. It is <a href="http://www.lastampa.it/2017/04/23/italia/cronache/abbiamo-le-prove-dei-contatti-tra-scafisti-e-alcuni-soccorritori-3fCnqLKWWRHBVUiygHv65K/pagina.html">suspected</a> [La Stampa report, in Italian] that NGO migrant rescue ships have been colluding with Libya-based human smugglers. While some Italian politicians have criticized the work of these NGOs for running "taxi services" for migrants, some of which could say could be "criminals," human rights and humanitarian groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] have applauded the NGOs for saving countless lives. Some NGOs involved in the migrant rescues include <a href="http://www.msf.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a>, <a href="http://sosmediterranee.org/?lang=en">SOS Mediterranee</a>, <a href="https://www.savethechildren.net/">Save the Children</a> and Malta-based <a href="https://www.moas.eu/">Mobile Offshore Aid Station</a> (MOAS) [advocacy websites], though all have denied these accusations. Though it is common for Italy's coast guard to call upon private vessels to assist in rescuing migrants in the 'rescue zone' in the waters between Italy and Libya, Zuccaro has called into question the propriety of the new NGOs dedicated to this task, as well as the policy of relying upon established NGOs to intervene in the Mediterranean. </p>

<p>Protection of migrants from Libya, including a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/unicef-calls-for-protection-of-migrant-women-in-children-on-the-mediterranean-route.php">call by UNICEF</a> [JURIST report] last month for the protection of migrant women and children traveling through the Mediterranean, has been a significant issue due to instability within Libya. Libya has remained politically unstable since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">deposition of Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war. In September the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kate Gilmore spoke on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-continuing-to-deteriorate.php">deteriorating human rights situation</a> [JURIST report] in Libya and called for accountability and reform. Earlier last year the UN released a report detailing a "litany of violations and abuses" being committed by both state and non-state actors in Libya that may amount to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-report-libya-abuses-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.divanealee.ir/">Supreme Court of Iran</a> [official website] upheld the conviction and five-year prison sentence of a British-Iranian woman on Monday, but did not disclose the crime she is accused of committing. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/iran-charges-dual-nationals-foreigner-crackdown-160711150049372.html">was arrested</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] at an airport last summer after visiting her Iranian parents and introducing them to their granddaughter, according to statements from her husband. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter remains in Iran, with her grandparents. Although no specific charges were disclosed when she was indicted by the Revolutionary Court in Iran last September, Iran's top prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said she was involved in a plot seeking the "soft-toppling" of the Iranian government. According to a <a href="http://about.trust.org/contentAsset/raw-data/b6dd671d-bd1f-4805-b81b-03efef97f8d0/document">statement</a> [text, PDF] from <a href="http://www.trust.org/">Thomas Reuter Foundation's CEO</a> [advocacy website], Zaghari-Ratcliffe was employed by the London-based charity, and had no dealings with Iran that would have lead to criminal charges. <blockquote>The fact that the Supreme Court has rejected Nazanin's final appeal to overturn her sentence is a huge blow. I would like to reiterate that I am entirely convinced of Nazanin's innocence. She is not a spy but an innocent mother who travelled to Iran only to show her baby to her parents. I stand united with [her husband] Richard in calling for her immediate release.</blockquote>The human rights conditions of journalists and others in Iran have continued to be an matter of concern worldwide. In January Iran <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-releases-iranian-prisoners-in-order-to-free-us-prisoners-in-iran.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to release four US citizens in exchange for seven Iranians being held in the US for violating sanctions against Iran.  In November UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-to-stop-limiting-journalists-freedom.php">stated that authorities in Iran</a> [JURIST report] should cease arresting, prosecuting and harassing journalists and online activists and the country should provide a safe space for freedom of expression. In October the UN released a report stating that Iran's human rights situation <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-report-iran-human-rights-situation-still-dismal-even-after-nuclear-deal.php">remains</a> alarming despite the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/iran-council-gives-final-nuclear-deal-approval.php">signing</a> [JURIST reports] of the nuclear deal earlier in October. In May UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-experts-condemn-increase-in-iran-executions.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the growing number of executions in Iran in recent years. According to the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Iran and on extrajudicial executions, Iran had executed approximately six people per day between April 9 and April 26 and 350 total up to that point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.jordan.gov.jo/wps/portal/!ut/p/b1/04_SjzQ0N7C0NDK1MDPXj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOLDLL0twrzdDQ0sPNwtDDy9DIzMfM2djA1CzfSDU_P0c6McFQEaBWgU/">Jordanian Cabinet</a> [official website] on Sunday revoked <a href="http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/ar/jo/jo064ar.pdf">Article 308</a> [penal code text, in Arabic], a provision of Jordan's penal code which opponents said would allow rapists to avoid a jail term in return for marrying their victim for at least three years. Although the statute was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39692020">amended</a> [BBC report] in 2016 to only apply to women and girls between the ages of 15 to 18 where the interaction was believed to be consensual, women's right groups <a href="http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/activists-applaud-royal-committee&#8217;s-recommendations-women-rights">intensified</a> [Jordan Times report] their efforts to have the law repealed. According to a <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/sites/default/files/EqualityNowRapeLawReport2017_Single%20Pages.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org">Equality Now</a> [official website], an international women's rights activist group, similar laws still exist in Lebanon, Iraq, the Philippines, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, Bahrain.</p>

<p>Movements to change these laws are being organized all over the world. Equality Now is currently advancing its <a href="http://www.equalitynow.org/campaigns/rape-laws-report">"Global Rape Epidemic" campaign</a> [official webstie] to bring attention to laws like the one in Jordan and many other laws which limit women's rights. On Saturday, activists in Lebanon protested against the nation's rape loophole law by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39680838">hanging wedding dresses from nooses</a> [BBC report] along the Beruit shore. Lebanese activists are hoping to have the law repealed during the Lebanese parliament's next session. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Filipino lawyer <a href="https://twitter.com/jude_sabio2?lang=en">Jude Sabio</a> [personal Twitter] filed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://img.abs-cbnnews.com/2017/downloads/FINAL_ICC_Sabio.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] Monday against Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte accusing him of extrajudicial killings during his nationwide anti-drugs crackdown. The 77-page complaint was filed before the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] and asks the court to prosecute Duterte over his involvement in the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2009/04/06/you-can-die-any-time/death-squad-killings-mindanao">Davao Death Squad</a> [HRW backgrounder]. In an accompanying statement, Sabio accused the Duterte of "repeatedly, unchangingly and continuously" committing extrajudicial executions from his term as Mayor of Davao City through to his current presidency. Sabio <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2017/04/24/1693489/criminal-case-vs-duterte-filed-international-criminal-court">is asking the ICC</a> [PhilStar report] to charge Duterte and 11 senior government officials with crimes against humanity and to issue an arrest warrant for them. Duterte has denied his involvement in the death squad and maintained that any killings of drug suspects were conducted within the bounds of the law.</p>

<p>Over 8,000 people have been killed since Duterte took office last year over drug-related offenses. Numerous rights groups have been critical of the killings and have spoken out against the current administration. Early in March <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report that accused the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December a UN Human rights chief called for a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] after Duterte admitted to killing people in his role as mayor. Duterte has seemed skeptical of the ICC , in November he suggested that the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/philippines-president-contemplating-leaving-icc.php">might leave</a> [JURIST report] the international body.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard oral arguments on Monday in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-5294.htm">McWilliams v. Dunn</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-6219.htm">Davila v. Davis</a> [dockets], two cases related to capital punishment. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mcwilliams-v-dunn/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">McWilliams</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], the court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/16-5294_g314.pdf">heard arguments</a>  [transcript, PDF] on whether a defendant in Alabama whose mental health was an issue in his case should have been entitled to psychiatric assistance independent of the prosecution. The petitioner was sentenced to death after being convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in 1984. His trial attorney received a report from the inmate's psychiatric hospital the day before sentencing, and another psychological report from the state prison on the day of his sentencing. The trial judge concluded McWilliams was "faking [and] faking" his condition, despite contradictory conclusions in the reports. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/davila-v-davis/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Davila v. Davis</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], the court heard arguments on whether a failure to raise a claim of ineffective appellate counsel in a capital case should be excused due to ineffective assistance of counsel in a state habeas proceeding. The inmate is a gang member who killed a woman and her five-year-old granddaughter while attempting to shoot a rival gang member at a birthday party. The court will decide if there is a meaningful distinction between ineffective counsel at the appellate level as opposed to trial. While the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-6219-pet-merits-reply.pdf">petitioner claims</a> [materials] no meaningful difference has been recognized by the courts, the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-6219-bs.pdf">respondent claims</a> [materials] the right to appellate counsel is not equivalent to the right to trial counsel, and should not be treated as such. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://www.lafargeholcim.com/eric-olsen-management">Eric Olsen</a> [corporate profile], CEO of cement manufacturer <a href="http://www.lafargeholcim.com/">LafargeHolcim</a> [corporate website], announced on Monday that he will resign following the discovery that LafargeHolcim had paid armed groups in Syria to prevent a factory from closing.  French prosecutors are <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/lafargeholcim-syria-ceo-idINL8N1HW0EU">investigating</a> [Reuters report] the payments, and two human rights groups filed a complaint in a French court against the corporation, alleging that it may have been "complicit in financing Islamic State and in war crimes."  Olsen said in his <a href="http://www.lafargeholcim.com/ceo-departure">resignation</a> [text], "While I was absolutely not involved in, nor even aware of, any wrongdoing I believe my departure will contribute to bringing back serenity to a company that has been exposed for months on this case."  Beat Hess, current Chairman of the Board, will take over Olsen's responsibilities until a new CEO is hired.</p>

<p>In February France <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/france-approves-law-to-hold-parent-corporations-liable-for-subsidiary-human-rights-violations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a law to hold parent corporations liable for subsidiary human rights violations.  The law was inspired by the 2013 garment factory collapse in Bangladesh which <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/08/bangladesh-factory-collapse-trial-postponed.php">killed over 1,000 people</a> [JURIST report].  The French companies using the factory blamed their suppliers and were not liable for the safety violations under French law at the time. Last April Bangladeshi workers <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/bangladesh-workers-demand-justice-on-anniversary-of-garment-factory-collapse.php">gathered</a> [JURIST report] on the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza garment factory disaster to demand justice for the incident. In July a Bangladesh court officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/bangladesh-court-indicts-41-for-murder-in-connection-with-2013-garment-factory-collapse.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] 41 people with murder stemming from the 2013 garment factory collapse after finding that the staff allegedly forced workers to stay in the unstable establishment despite concerns that the structure was visibly cracking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday refused to hear an appeal by <a href="http://www.gm.com/index.html">General Motors</a> (GM) [corporate website] on its potential liability for ignition-switch defects. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] had <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/15-2844/15-2844-2016-07-13.html">ruled</a> [opinion] against General Motors' argument that it was not liable for the defects because they were made before it formed a new company following Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2015, the court held that GM was, in fact, open to liability for the ignition-switch defects. With the Supreme Court's refusal to hear GM's appeal, the currently pending claims against GM will move forward. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-ruling-idUSKCN0ZT1RR">claims have been estimated</a> [Reuters report] to be worth between $7 billion and $10 billion. </p>

<p>GM has already <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/gm-reaches-900-million-settlement-of-criminal-charges-over-faulty-ignition-switches.php">settled </a>[JURIST report] for $900 million with the <a href="http://www.doj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to stop a criminal probe by the US, $575 million to settle a shareholder suit and more than 1,380 civil cases by victims, and $595 million through a victims' compensation fund outside of court. In recent years other car manufacturers have also faced legal issues for allegedly failing to address malfunctions. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/nhtsa-imposes-record-105-million-penalty-in-chrysler-recall.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in July that it imposed a $105 million penalty against <a href="http://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx">Fiat Chrysler</a> [corporate website] for its failure to provide a remedy and notices for 23 recalls related to automobile malfunctions. In 2014 the DOJ announced <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/doj-announces-12-billion-settlement-with-toyota.php">a $1.2 billion settlement</a> [JURIST report] agreement with Toyota for misleading customers and US regulators. In November 2012 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/toyota-settles-shareholder-class-action-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit for $35.5 million brought by its shareholders failing to disclose vehicle quality issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The State of Hawaii filed its <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/04/22/17-15589%20Answering%20Brief.pdf">answer</a> [text, PDF] as plaintiff with the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday in a lawsuit against the administration of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official website], concerning <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Executive Order 13780</a> [text], also known as the "revised travel ban." The state maintains that a preliminary injunction issued by the district court should be affirmed, arguing that the order is overstepping presidential authority. Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/justice-department-appeals-court-injunction-on-travel-ban.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] after the district judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Hawaii in March.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month the State of Hawaii <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hawaii-asks-full-appeals-court-to-hear-travel-ban-case.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] for the full appeals court to hear the case. In March the appeals court had <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-expedites-review-of-trump-travel-ban.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an expedited schedule for the appeal. That same month a Washington federal judge refused to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-federal-judge-declines-to-reinstate-injunction-on-trumps-amended-travel-ban.php">reinstate</a> [JURIST report] his injunction on Trump's original travel ban. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian President <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/profile-of-the-president.htm">Shri Pranab Mukherjee</a> [official profile] on Monday approved the <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/HIV/HIV-AIDS%20Bill,%202014.pdf">Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill </a> [text, PDF]. The law is intended to prevent discrimination against individuals with HIV and AIDS, and makes it a fine-able offense to disclose the HIV-positive status of an individual against his or her will. These protections extend to employment, service accommodations, property rentals, and insurance. Further, the act requires that informed consent be obtained before any HIV test, treatment, or research is conducted. The act also requires state governments to "take measures to facilitate better access to welfare schemes," broadly mandating local governments take action to better accommodate individuals with HIV and AIDS. The Bill was initially <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/india-parliament-moves-ahead-hivaids-prevention-bill.php">approved </a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a> [official website] earlier in April. </p>

<p>International efforts continue to not only prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS but also to protect the rights of the individuals afflicted. In January the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-files-lawsuit-against-nyc-for-denying-job-to-hiv-positive-applicant.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against New York City for revoking the offer of an emergency dispatch position because the applicant was HIV positive. In June 2016 a group of UN independent human rights experts said that human rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-aids-epidemic-driven-by-human-rights-violations.php">violations contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS</a> [JURIST report]. In May of that same year California's governor signed Senate Bill 1408 into law, allowing HIV-positive individuals to become <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/california-passes-bill-allowing-hiv-positive-donors.php">transplant donors to HIV-positive recipients</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015 President Barack Obama issued<a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/executiveorders/13703.php"> executive order 13703 </a>[JURIST documents] "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy," which was intended to ensure successful implementation of the the updated national AIDS/HIV strategy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario">Province of Ontario</a> [official website] announced Monday that it will <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2017/04/premier-lays-out-plan-for-fairness-and-security-in-uncertain-times.html">begin a trial program for universal basic income</a> [press release] this summer. The Ontario government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/24/canada-basic-income-trial-ontario-summer">said</a> [Guardian report] that it will test the policy on roughly 4,000 participants.  Participants for the three-year program will be selected from a randomly selected mailing invite for individuals between the ages of 18 and 64.  The program will be aimed at individuals on social assistance, in low paying jobs, or in positions of danger.  The pilot is meant to help determine whether universal income is feasible.  Opponents of the program are skeptical of its impact and concerned with the feasibility of financially supporting the project after previous failed attempts.  Participants will receive an unconditional monthly income that does not effect their various benefits.  The program will monitor the impact the income has on the participants health, education, housing and labor market participation.</p>

<p>Various <a href="/feature/2015/11/minimum-wage-feature-section-iv.php">income movements</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have increased over recent years. In June Swiss voters <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/switzerland-voters-reject-universal-basic-income-plan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a universal basic income plan.  In 2014 Swiss citizens <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27459178">also rejected</a> [BBC report] a measure to give Switzerland the world's highest minimum wage. That measure would have raised the Swiss minimum wage to 22 francs an hour. Both of these measures were rejected by over three-fourths of the population. In March Baltimore <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/baltimore-city-council-approves-bill-to-raise-minimum-wage.php">approved a raise</a> [JURIST report] to the minimum wage.  In February the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/uk-supreme-court-upholds-minimum-income-policy-for-immigrant-spouses.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] minimum income for immigrant spouses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">NAACP</a> [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/press-release/lawyers-committee-civil-rights-law-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgias-voter-registration-scheme-2/">announced a lawsuit</a> [press release] against the state of Georgia, claiming that state's 2015 voter redistricting was discriminatory. The group <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-04-24/lawsuit-2015-redistricting-violated-black-voters-rights">claims</a> [US News report] that lawmakers redrew voting district lines for political gain at the expense of minority voters.  The complaint asks that a three-judge panel review the redistricting and order the lawmakers to re-draw the districts in question.  Furthermore, the NAACP has asked that no elections be held using the changed district lines. The lawsuit is namely concerned with the 105th and 111th district which plaintiffs argued saw a slight decrease in minority voters.</p>

<p>Voting rights and how voters are grouped and counted has become and increasingly important issue over the past year.  In January the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit Suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members.  Earlier that week the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-ordering-special-elections-in-north-carolina.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ruling ordering the redrawing of the congressional district map and special elections to be held in North Carolina. This came after the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-two-racial-gerrymandering-cases.php">Supreme Court heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in racial gerymanderings cases from Virginia and North Carolina in December. In September several organizations filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/georgia-voter-registration-system-challenged-by-federal-lawsuit.php">federal lawsuit challenging Georgia's voter registration system</a> [JURIST report]. Last April the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">Supreme Court unanimously upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-25-17.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in two civil procedure cases: <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-466.htm">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County</a>, and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-405.htm">BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell</a> [dockets].<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bristol-myers-squibb-co-v-superior-court-of-california-san-francisco-county/"> Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] focuses on whether plaintiffs may sue in a state that has no particular connection to them, but has significant connection to the defendant. The plaintiffs range from 33 states, but the action is taking place solely in California. Bristol-Myers operates out of the East Coast but runs its business nationwide. The California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-466-op-below-Cal.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] for the plaintiffs as Bristol-Myers' contacts with the forum were "related to" the claims brought by plaintiffs out-of-state, but rejected general jurisdiction claims.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bnsf-railway-co-v-tyrrell/">BNSF Railway</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] focuses on whether the court should uphold its decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1929137067016164680&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Daimler AG v. Bauman</a> [opinion]. In <u>Daimler</u> the court ruled that a state court could not exercise general jurisdiction over a defendant not "at home" in the forum state. The plaintiffs in <u>BNSF Railway</u> ask the court as to whether the <u>Daimler</u> ruling would prohibit two US railroad workers from filing in Montana for injuries that occurred in other states. BNSF operates extensively in the state but has argued that it is not "at home" in Montana and therefore the cases should be dismissed. Plaintiffs have responded that as they are filing under the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/45/56"> Federal Employers' Liability Act</a> (FELA) [text], they are allowed to bring this suit anywhere the railroad was doing business as the time of the suit. Much of the case will be determined on how the Court applies <u>Daimler</u> and how it interprets FELA's jurisdiction element.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association (NRA)</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://d3uwh8jpzww49g.cloudfront.net/sharedmedia/1509624/rupp-v-becerra_filed-4-24-17_complaint.pdf">filed the first complaint</a> [text, PDF] in a <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170424/lawsuit-filed-against-californias-assault-weapons-control-act-1"> planned series of challenges</a> [NRA -ILA press release] to new California gun control laws put in place following the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/crime/shootings/san-bernardino-terror-attack-EVCAL00077-topic.html">San Bernardino attack</a> [LA Times backgrounder]. The complaint was filed in the US District Court for the <a href="https://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">Central District of California Southern Division</a> [official website]. Some experts <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-nra-gun-lawsuits-20170424-story.html">doubt</a> [LA Times report] that the legal challenges will prevail as the laws are "limiting gun use, not outlawing it completely."</p>

<p>California has been the center of much of the country's gun law controversies. In February a federal judge ruled that gun rights advocates are <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-gun-rights-advocates-can-publish-lawmakers-information.php">allowed to publish personal information</a> [JURIST report], such as addresses and telephone numbers, of legislators who voted in favor of California's recent gun control laws. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/federal-appeals-court-upholds-california-waiting-period-for-gun-purchases.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to California's 10-day waiting period for purchasing a gun. Also in December California's 5th District Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/california-court-remands-challenge-to-gun-microstamping-law.php">reversed and remanded</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling which rejected a challenge to a state law requiring gun microstamping. Last July California Governor Jerry Brown signed 20 bills into law, six of which were <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/california-governor-signs-gun-control-laws.php">bills altering the gun laws</a> [JURIST report] in the state </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1500_h3cj.pdf">ruled </a> [opinion, PDF] that tribal sovereign immunity does not extend to tribal employees acting in an individual capacity. <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lewis-v-clarke/">Lewis v. Clarke</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] arose when Brian and Michelle Lewis were injured in a car crash caused by William Clarke, an employee of the <a href="https://www.mohegan.nsn.us/">Mohegan Tribe</a> [official website] who was driving a Mohegan Sun Casino limousine. Clarke argued that he was entitled to sovereign immunity and the lawsuit should be dismissed. The Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that Clarke was entitled to sovereign immunity and dismissed the case. Justice Sotomayor, writing for an 8-0 majority, disagreed with the Connecticut ruling, holding that when a suit is filed against an individual, sovereign immunity does not apply. Clarke was treated as an individual in the lawsuit because the Lewises only wanted money from Clarke and wanted to hold Clarke responsible for his "individual wrongdoing." The Lewises did not ask for damages from the Mohegan Tribe in the suit.</p>

<p>Justices Thomas wrote a concurring opinion agreeing that Clarke was not entitled to sovereign immunity because the accident occurred outside of the Mohegan tribe's territorial boundaries. Justice Ginsburg also concurred, saying that "tribes, interacting with nontribal members outside reservation boundaries, should be subject to non-discriminatory state laws of general application." In other words, tribes should be treated like anyone else under the law when suits arise outside of tribal territory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jewish law explicitly forbids women from serving as judges on Jewish family courts, but no similar rule exists for their Muslim counterparts. Women's advocates in the country <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-historic-step-first-female-judge-appointed-to-israels-sharia-courts/">hope the appointment</a> [<em>Times of Israel</em> report] will help lead to broader roles for women in Israel's judiciary. The judge, Hana Mansour-Khatib, is expected to be sworn in by Israel President Reuven Rivlin at some point in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Women's roles in the judiciary have been controversial in Israel and other countries in the region for some time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who">District Judge William Orrick from the Northern District of California</a> [official profile] on Tuesday issued a<a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who/sanctuary-litigation"> temporary injunction</a> [text, PDF]  against Executive Order 13768, titled <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united">Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States</a> [text, PDF] which would have allowed the federal government to withhold funds from cities which have been designated as "sanctuary cities." In the ijunction, Orrick rejected the government's argument that it did not reach beyond the president's scope, saying "[t]he President has called it [']a weapon['] to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his preferred policies of immigration enforcement" and holding that "[t]he Constitution vests the spending powers in Congress, not the President, so the Order cannot constitutionally place new conditions on federal funds." Orrick found that the counties had a likelihood of success in the case against section 9(a) of the order and that they would be irreparably harmed without an injunction in place. The court also noted that the injunction did not "impact the Government's ability to use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants or 8 U.S.C. 1373, nor does it restrict the Secretary from developing regulations or preparing guidance on designating a jurisdiction as a 'sanctuary jurisdiction.'" Earlier this month, Orrick  <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-hears-case-against-order-keeping-funds-from-sanctuary-cities.php"> heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] over President Trump's executive order withholding federal funds from so-called "sanctuary cities". </p>

<p>Immigration has been a key focus for Trump since his inauguration. One part of Trump's plan has been to cut federal funding for cities that do not inquire into the immigration status and would not act with or on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the so called '<a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">sanctuary cities</a>' [JURIST commentary]. Trump passed the executive ordercutting funding to sanctuary cities. The order was also <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/seattle-sues-trump-over-sanctuary-cities-executive-order.php">challenged </a>[JURIST report] by the city of Seattle in March, arguing that their designation as a "sanctuary city" should not prevent them from receiving federal funds. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://okdeathpenaltyreview.org/about/">Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission </a>[official website] on Tuesday released a <a href="http://okdeathpenaltyreview.org/the-report/">report </a>[text, PDF] in which they "unanimously recommend[ed] that the current moratorium on the death penalty [in Oklahoma] be extended." While the report noted that it was difficult to come to that decision, "[d]ue to the volume and seriousness of the flaws in Oklahoma's capital punishment system," it advised the moratorium should be extended until "significant reforms are accomplished." The report also included recommendations for reforms such as recommendations for innocence protection, prosecution and defense of death penalty cases, clemency, execution procedures, as well as recommendations to the judiciary and the requirements for death eligibility. Particularly notable among the recommendations was the Commissions advisement that "the one-drug (barbiturate) lethal injection protocol" was the "most humane and effective method of execution possible." The commission also recommended that  Oklahoma "develop a process for continuous review of its execution protocol to ensure that the state is using the most humane and effective method possible." The mommission concluded the report acknowledging that their recommendations were very broad but contended that<blockquote> "Broad strokes are needed at present to produce a foundation upon which finer details may be applied with confidence."</blockquote>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Last month, the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-supreme-court-allows-planned-executions-to-go-forward.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] stating there is no stay in place preventing the execution of eight inmates schedule. Also last month, Orlando, Florida, Chief Prosecutor Aramis Ayala,<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/orlando-chief-prosecutor-rejects-death-penalty-for-all-future-cases.php"> announced </a>[JURIST report] that her office would no longer seek the death penalty in Osceola and Orange counties, prompting Florida Governor Rick Scott to issue an executive order removing her from a case involving the killing of Orlando police lieutenant Debra Clayton. In February, the Mississippi House /paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php"></a>[JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused </a>[JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In December a report by the Death Penalty Information Center found that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">use of capital punishment in the US is at a 20-year low</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-26-17.pdf">heard arguments</a> [day call, PDF] on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/15-1039_bqm1.pdf">Amgen Inc. v. Sandoz Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/16-309_b97c.pdf">Maslenjak v. United States</a> [transcripts, PDF]. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/amgen-inc-v-sandoz-inc/">Amgen Inc. v. Sandoz Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court is asked to determine how much patent protection should be afforded to drugs that are "biosimilar" to "biologics." Biologics are complex bio-engineered drugs, and when their patents expire generic drug companies are usually free to enter the market with the same drug. However, because biologics are so complex, only biosimilar rather than identical drugs can be produced after the patent expires. The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a> [HHS backgrounder] contains a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/UCM216146.pdf">biologics provision</a> [text, PDF] that was intended to streamline the FDA approval process for biosimilar drugs. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/maslenjak-v-united-states/">Maslenjak v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court is asked to resolve a circuit split on the question of whether naturalized US citizens can be stripped of their citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on an immaterial false statement. The case arose when Divna Maslenjak moved to the US from what is now Bosnia and became a US citizen seven years later.  Recently her citizenship was revoked when it became known that she made false statements to immigration officials during the naturalization process. She argues that while she did lie, she should not be stripped of her citizenship because her false statements were not material to the decision of whether she should be granted citizenship. The question turns on whether such materiality is relevant in the determination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d657c9d8ed371042aa9e5abc37cb17de80.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Pax0Te0?text=&docid=190142&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=358299">ruled</a> [judgment, text]  Wednesday that devices with pre-installed software that make it easier to stream pirated content may violate an European Union (EU) <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:0010:0019:EN:PDF">copyright protection directive</a> [text, PDF]. The court determined that the sale of such multimedia players, often including popular so-called "streaming sticks," constitute a "communication to the public" that falls within the definition of the statute, which is prohibited. Because the purpose of the directive was to create a high level of protection for authors, the court held that "communication to the public" must be interpreted broadly. The court <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-04/cp170040en.pdf">also found</a> [press release] that even temporary acts of reproduction of copyrighted work by streaming on a third party website that offers the work without the copyright holder's consent cannot be exempted from the right of reproduction.</p>

<p>File-sharing sites and the sharing of copyrighted materials continues to be a global issue. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-vimeo-copyright-infringement-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear an appeal [order list, PDF] from record companies that want to pursue a copyright infringement case against music site Vimeo [corporate website] for hosting music by classic artists. In February the <a href="http://www.patentochmarknadsoverdomstolen.se/">Swedish Court of Patent Appeals and the Market Court</a> [official website, in Swedish], an appellate court with exclusive jurisdiction over intellectual property cases, <a href="http://www.patentochmarknadsoverdomstolen.se/Domstolar/pmod/2017/PMT%2011706-15%20Dom%202017-02-13.pdf">ordered</a> [judgment, PDF, in Swedish] an Internet service provider (ISP) to block access to the file-sharing site The Pirate Bay and the streaming site Swefilmer. In December the Federal Court of Australia <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/australia-court-isps-must-block-pirate-bay-and-other-websites-for-copyright-infringement.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an ISP to block five named companies and all their related websites. The same issue was decided by Irish and Dutch courts in 2013 and 2014, where the courts came to different results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A French court on Thursday <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-haradinaj-serbia-extradition-france-court-04-27-2017">refused</a> [BIRN report] an extradition request for former Kosovo prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4329091.stm">Ramush Haradinaj</a> [BBC profile], who is facing war crime charges in Serbia.  The court <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39730103">released</a> [BBC report] Haradinaj shortly thereafter giving the parties five days to appeal. The Serbian government has stated the decision is unlawful and has recalled its ambassador in protest.  Representatives of the former prime minister state that extradition would have led to an unfair and unbalanced trial.  The request came after French police <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/former-kosovo-pm-arrested-in-france-for-war-crimes.php">arrested Haradinaj</a> [JURIST report] in January on a Serbian arrest warrant, leading to the Serbian extradition request and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18328859">Kosovo</a> [BBC country profile] requesting the intervention of the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Haradinaj was a senior commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, that opposed Slobodan Milosevic during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder]. He was tried twice and acquitted of 37 charges of war crimes in both <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">2008</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/war-crimes-tribunal-acquits-former-kosovo-liberation-army-commander.php">2012</a> [JURIST reports] by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">Texas State House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved on Thursday a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB4/id/1598079/Texas-2017-SB4-Comm_Sub.html">strict ban</a> [SB 4, text] on so-called "sanctuary cities."  The bill seeks to <a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/texas/texas-house-oks-sanctuary-city-ban-with-tough-jail-penalty_">empower law enforcement</a> [ABC report] to enforce federal immigration law against detainees and threatens to jail any police chiefs or sheriffs who refuse to follow federal law.  The bill would allow the Texas government to withhold funding from local governments acting as sanctuary cities in order to help "keep the public safe and remove bad people from the street."  Their was <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-house-passes-sanctuary-cities-ban-9412412">opposition to the bill</a> [<em>Dallas Observer </em>report] after an amendment allowed local law enforcement to inquire about federal immigration status during detainment as well as after an arrest.  There is fear that this amendment could lead to a strained relationship between the community and the police.  The amendment put the bill closer to the state's senate version that has been passed, however the two chambers will still need to compromise on the bill before sending it to the governor.</p>

<p>Since the election of US President Donald Trump, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">continue to stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last month the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies.  In February, the Alabama House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. In the same month, Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/texas-senate-approves-bill-targeting-sanctuary-cities.php">approved a bill targeting sanctuary cities </a>[JURIST report] by requiring them to comply with federal immigration law. Earlier in February San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding</a> [JURIST report] from sanctuary cities. In January, San Francisco's police chef was <a href="paperchase/2017/01/san-francisco-sued-by-undocumented-immigrant-over-violation-of-sanctuary-city-law.php">sued by an undocumented El Salvadorian over the city's sanctuary protection laws</a> [JURIST report]. Also in January, the New York Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/new-york-ag-proposes-model-language-for-laws-and-policies-regarding-immigration.php">proposed model language</a> [JURIST report] for immigration laws and policies in sanctuary cities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Texas sues FDA to release seized lethal injection drugs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/">Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3678400/TDCJ-v-FDA-Amended-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF] the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] on Wednesday after the FDA <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/fda-prevents-lethal-injection-drug-shipment-to-texas.php">banned a shipment</a> [JURIST report] of lethal injection drugs to prison officials. Texas argued that the lethal injection drugs are lawful and comply with FDA standards, and that the FDA "erroneously concluded" that the drugs violate <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/355">21 U.S.C. § 355(a)</a> [text]. The ban applies to sodium thiopental and thiopental sodium, which Texas argues are the same drug, despite a 2011 FDA document which provided for, "admissibility of all imports of sodium thiopental intended to be shipped to correctional facilities." According to the complaint, there are over 200 offenders in Texas awaiting execution through lethal injection. Texas requested the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/district">District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] to declare the FDA's action unlawful and to set aside the import ban rule. </p>

<p>The death penalty continues to be a point of contention across the United States. In January Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. In November the legal status of the death penalty was <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/voters-in-three-states-reaffirm-death-penalty.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by state referendum in Oklahoma, Nebraska and California. In September executions in Oklahoma were put on a two-year hiatus so Oklahoma can <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/oklahoma-executions-stayed-until-agreement-reached-on-new-procedures.php">reevaluate its lethal injection procedures</a> [JURIST report] following a botched execution and several drug mix-ups in the past two years. In December a report by the Death Penalty Information Center found that the use of capital punishment in the US is at a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">20-year low</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://tj2zy.chinacourt.org/index.shtml">Second Intermediate People's Court in Tianjin</a> [official website] on Friday gave human rights lawyer <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/2015/08/prisoner-of-conscience-li-heping/">Li Heping</a> [advocacy profile] a three-year suspended sentence for subversion. He has been in jail since being detained in the summer of 2015. Heping represented many high-profile defendants including practitioners of the banned religion <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong</a> [oranization website]. His subversion conviction stemmed from a charge of endangering national security and social stability by working with religious groups and other lawyers to "attack" the government. The trial was closed to the public to prevent the disclosure of state secrets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/world/asia/chinese-rights-lawyer-li-heping-sentence.html?_r=0">according</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] to a statement from the court. Heping's sentence was suspended for four years, which means he may be released but effectively prevents him from returning to his job as a human rights lawyer. </p>

<p>China has faced continued international criticism for its treatment of human rights defenders, ranging from filing of arbitrary criminal charges, suspension or dismissal of law licenses, and disappearances. In February, the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report] highlighting intensified crackdowns on human rights defenders. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of human rights lawyer</a> [JURIST report] Jiang Tianyong, after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. Last September China handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">12 year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July China announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ratified a law Thursday that will allow him to appoint head judges in the country's highest courts. The amended law, which <a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/27/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9/3209487">was ratified</a> [<em>Youm7</em> report, in Arabic] when it was published in the <a href="http://www.alamiria.com/a/html_pages/befor1.htm">official gazette</a> [materials], allows el-Sisi to chose one of three potential judges nominated by each court to be the head of that court. Previously, leadership passed to the most senior member of the court, and the president was expected to sign off on the leadership role in a process that was largely ceremonial. El-Sisi and supporters of the change insist that the move is necessary to strengthen his administration's authority as they tackle issues such as terrorism, but members of the Egyptian judiciary have resisted the change. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Judges Club, a group with over 9,000 members of the judiciary in Egypt, <a href="http://www.youm7.com/story/2017/4/26/%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9/3206737">issued a unified statement</a> [<em>Youm7</em> report, in Arabic] condemning the amendments. The statement was a response to the passing of the amendment in parliament, a vote that was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzeSpk6Z7SU">contested by some officials</a> [video, in Arabic] who feel the change is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Js2F6wv7U">majority argued that the change is constitutional</a> [video, in Arabic], and narrowly tailored to allow the judiciary to remain independent. </p>

<p>El-Sisi has been viewed by many in the international community as a moderate leader compared to previous Egyptian presidents who were often embroiled in scandals and accusations of corruption. Former president Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/egypt-former-president-hosni-mubarak-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] last month after six years in custody. Mubarak and other members of his administration have been consistently involved in judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In October 2015 another Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/egyptian-court-orders-release-of-former-presidents-sons.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, after holding that they have completed their three-year prison sentences for embezzlement. Last November, Egypt's <a href="http://www.cc.gov.eg/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/egypt-court-strikes-down-former-presidents-life-sentence.php">overturned the life sentences</a> [JURIST report] of former president Mohamed Morsi and 16 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi had been <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/egypt-court-overturns-mohamed-morsi-life-sentence-161122074711134.html">convicted</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] for conspiring with the Palestinian Hamas and other foreign militant groups. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.chambresafricaines.org/">Extraordinary African Chambers</a> (EAC) [official website, in French] in Senegal <a href="http://www.chambresafricaines.org/pdf/Jugement_complet.pdf">upheld</a> [ruling, in French] the life sentence of Chad's former dictator Hissene Habre [HRW backgrounder] for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and torture. Habre was sentenced to life in prison for rape, various war crimes, and torture <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKBN17T1QQ-OZATP?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">last year</a> [Reuters report], however, his counsel appealed, believing that his sentence was too severe. On appeal, the EAC overturned his conviction for rape, however, it upheld his life sentence finding that the punishment was not disproportionate to the crimes committed by Habre. Judge Ougadeye Wafi also established a $135 million fund to compensate the victims of Habre. The funds will be supplied from the seizure of Habre's assets. Habre's conviction marks the first time in modern history that the court of one African country prosecuted and convicted the former leader of another African nation on rights charges. </p>

<p>Habré, who fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/former-chad-dictator-charged-with-war-crimes.php">was indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the Extraordinary African Chambers in July 2013 and placed in pretrial detention. In September 2015 the <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-chad-leader-carried-into-court-for-war-crimes-trial.php">former leader was carried into court</a> [JURIST report] by masked security agents following his refusal to participate in his own trial. In July 2015 the <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-chad-leader-trial-suspended-upon-appointment-of-counsel.php">Extraordinary African Chambers in Senegal suspended</a> [JURIST report] his trial on charges of crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes, reportedly due to the need for court appointed lawyers to prepare the former leader's defense. In March 2015 a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/chad-court-sentences-habre-era-police-officers-for-torture.php">criminal court in Chad sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Habré-era police officers to prison tor torture. In 2013 more than 1,000 victims filed for civil party status, asking the Extraordinary African Chambers to officially recognize them as parties with an interest in the matter. The African Union began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habré's trial after the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">International Court of Justice ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July 2012 that Senegal must either try Habré promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday granted a request from the Trump administration to stay ligation concerning an Obama administration air pollution regulation. The rule in question, the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/mats">Mercury and Air Toxics Standard</a> (MATS) [EPA backgrounder], has been in place for numerous years and has many coal-fired power plants have already come into compliance with its terms. Many industry groups and 15 state prosecutors, included current <a href="https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/epas-administrator">EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt </a>[official profile], challenged the rule. As a result of the court's action, all of the pending litigation around the country has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-mercury-idUSL1N1HZ2DT">stayed</a> [Reuters report] in order for the EPA to review the rule.   </p>

<p>MATS, which was enacted under the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [materials, PDF], has been a controversial regulation.In March the Supreme Court ordered that the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">delay enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants">Clean Power Plan </a> (CPP) [materials], of which MATS is a part of, pending a resolution to legal challenges. The request to block the implementation of the CPP was made in late January 2016, with states <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/states-appeal-to-the-supreme-court-to-stay-energy-plan.php">insisting</a> [JURIST report] that the plan's implementation would create a burden on states. Regulating power plant emissions has been a contentious issue. In June 2016 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-emissions-regulations-must-consider-costs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 5-4 that the EPA could not make regulations regarding the toxic emissions of power plants without considering costs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/presidential-executive-order-implementing-america-first-offshore-energy">executive order</a> [text] on Friday to lift restrictions placed on offshore oil drilling.  According to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/president-donald-j-trump-open-americas-energy-potential">statement</a> [press release], about 94 percent of the US Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) was either off-limits to or not considered for oil and gas exploration and development under previous rules. Trump blamed federal regulations for high unemployment in the state of Alaska, where oil and gas are a significant part of the economy, and said lifting restrictions would create thousands of jobs. Opponents, including US Congressman <a href="http://crist.house.gov/">Charlie Christ</a> (D-FL) [official website], <a href="http://crist.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=187">criticized</a> [press release] the move, citing environmental risks posed by drilling such as the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/bp-settlement/">Deep Water Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST backgrounder].</p>

<p>In 2016, US President Obama <a href="/forum/2017/01/Victor-Flatt-arctic-drilling.php">withdrew </a> [JURIST op-ed] all of the northern Atlantic Ocean and most of the Arctic Ocean under federal jurisdiction from oil exploration and production through the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. In January, the <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/SupremeCourt/">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/washington-supreme-court-rules-against-plans-for-oil-terminal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against plans for a big oil terminal on the West Coast. The same month, President Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-orders-to-advance-construction-of-oil-pipeline.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] presidential memoranda to progress construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline. In March, the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit </a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-appeals-court-refuse-request-to-stop-oil-flowing-through-dakota-access-pipeline.php">rejected an emergency request</a> [JURIST report] from two Native American tribes attempting to stop the oil flow through the Dakota Access Pipeline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey <a href="https://turkeyblocks.org/2017/04/29/wikipedia-blocked-turkey/">blocked</a> [Turkey Blocks press release] the website <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> [official website] on Saturday deeming it a threat to national security. Opponents say Turkey's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-internet-wikipedia-idUSKBN17V06Q">choice</a> [Reuters report] to block the website further supports rights groups and Turkey's Western allies opinion that the country prohibits freedom of speech and other basic rights. Turkey supported its decision stating a law permits it to block access to individual web pages or entire websites for the protection of the order, national security, or general welfare. Turkey's communications ministry alleged that Wikipedia was attempting to run a "smear campaign" against it. Under the law, allowing them to ban Wikipedia, the government has to submit its ban to a court within 24 hrs and the court then has two days to determine if the ban should be upheld.</p>

<p>Since a failed coup attempt last July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. At the end of January a judge for the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-court-orders-turkey-to-release-judge.php">ordered the release of a Turkish judge</a> [JURIST report] who was involved in adjudicating a Rwandan genocide case and had been incarcerated since July. Earlier in January the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/turkey-parliament-approves-plan-to-strengthen-presidential-powers.php">Turkish Parliament approved a plan</a> [JURIST report], which, if approved by vote later this year, would increase presidential power within the country and would allow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to stay in office until 2029.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South African President Jacob Zuma signed the anti-money laundering <a href="http://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/FIC2015/Financial%20Intelligence%20Centre%20Amendment%20Bill%20-%20draft%20for%20comment%2017-4-20.pdf">Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment</a> (FICA) [text, PDF] on Saturday to combat tax evasion and money laundering in the country. The global <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF) [official website] organization had threatened to oust South Africa if the amendment had not been passed before June 20. Supporters say the law is a tool against international financial crime, making it easier to identify the actual owners of accounts around the world and would apply to Zuma and other prominent figures in South Africa. The legislature passed the bill last year, but Zuma originally refused to sign it, citing concerns <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-29/south-africa-s-zuma-signs-anti-money-laundering-bill-into-law">about its constitutionality</a> [Bloomberg report]. In February the Legislature approved changes to the bill to meet Zuma's concerns. </p>

<p>The South African president has been connected to corruption on several occasions. In November 2016 the High Court of South Africa ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/south-africa-court-orders-release-of-zuma-corruption-report.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of a report on corruption allegations against Zuma, that he had attempted to block from release. In June 2016, a South African court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/jacob-zuma-corruption-appeal-denied.php">denied </a> [JURIST report] Zuma's appeal of a prior court ruling that he should face nearly 800 corruption charges. In March 2016, the South Africa Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Zuma to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Appeals court rules employers can use prior salary to justify paying women less</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="mailto:https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/04/27/16-15372.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] on Thursday that calculating salaries based solely on prior salaries does not violate the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm">Equal Pay Act </a> [text] even when it results in women being paid less than men for the same job. The case involves a math consultant working for a school district in Fresno County. The county's salary policy dictates that the starting salary of new employees is the employee's previous salary plus 5%. After working for three years at the school district, she found that her salary was lower than all  the other male math consultants, even one who had just started. The court ruled that a pay differential based on prior salary can be maintained only if its use of the prior salary "effectuates some business policy" and it is used "reasonably in light of the employer's stated purpose as well as its other practices." The lower court had previously denied the county's request for summary judgment stating "a pay structure based exclusively on prior wages is so inherently fraught with the risk . . . that it will perpetuate a discriminatory wage disparity between men and women that it cannot stand, even if motivated by a legitimate nondiscriminatory business purpose.</p>

<p>Equal treatment in the workplace has been an ongoing issue in the United States for many years. Earlier this month, the Office of Inspector General <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/oig-female-national-park-employees-faced-inappropriate-comments-treatment.php">released</a> [JURIST report] an investigative report on allegations of gender discrimination and sexual harassment at Yellowstone National Park. On April 7th, the U.S. Department of Labor <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/dol-accuses-google-of-systemic-gender-compensation-disparities.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Google of engaging in compensation discrimination against female employees. Additionally, In January, the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Oracle America, Inc. <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/labor-department-sues-oracle-for-employment-discrimination.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] that the company engaged in a systemic practice of paying their Caucasian male workers more than other employees. Furthermore, in March of 2016 five members of the US women's soccer team <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-womens-soccer-players-file-complaint-over-wage-discrimination.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an equal pay complaint against the US Soccer Federation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Steps have been taken to remedy some of the equal treatment issues, specifically among women. In January, the Mayor of Philadelphia <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/philadelphia-bans-employers-from-asking-for-salary-history.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] barring employers from asking applicants about their past salaries. This law was designed to decreased the wage gap between men and women. New York City and the state legislatures of New Jersey and Pennsylvania are also considering similar measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cairo Criminal Court on Sunday gave <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website] leader Wagdy Ghoneim a death sentence in absentia. He was <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/world/egypt-muslim-brotherhood-leader-wagdy-ghoneim-sentenced-to-death-by-cairo-criminal-court-3415334.html">found guilty</a> [First Post report]  of forming an outlaw cell from 2003 to 2015, for obstructing the constitution and state institution, assaulting citizens, and harming national unity.  Ghoneim currently lives in Turkey and has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-court-sentences-cleric-to-death-in-absentia/2017/04/30/899dd112-2d9d-11e7-a335-fa0ae1940305_story.html?utm_term=.e29657d7be71">rejected</a> [Washington Post report] the ruling stating that he has not been in Egypt since 2001.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish authorities removed more than 3900 people from their positions in the civil service and military pursuant to a new national security law <a href="http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2017/04/20170429-M1-1.htm">published</a> [materials, in Turkish] on Saturday. Those removed included prison guards, clerks, academics, and employees of the religious affairs ministry, all of whom the government <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkish-authorities-expel-more-3900-civil-service-latest-purge-1438446805">alleged</a> [MEE report] had links to terrorist organizations. This is the latest action by the Turkish government since a state of emergency was issued after a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36816045">failed coup attempt</a> [BBC backgrounder] in July of last year. Also on Saturday, Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-blocks-wikipedia-as-threat-to-national-security.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the website Wikipedia on the grounds that it posed a threat to national security.</p>

<p>Since a failed coup attempt in July the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. In October, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-turkish-emergency-decrees-permitting-government-sanctioned-torture.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the emergency decrees put in place after the failed coup had resulted in serious human rights violations.  In February, Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/top-europe-rights-official-urges-turkish-government-to-change-course.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to "change course and to display the responsibility and tolerance expected in a democratic society." The commissioner's document came amid increased scrutiny of Turkey's treatment of journalists and other members of Turkish society, allegedly leading to the repression of free speech and self-censorship. The Turkish Parliament has <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/turkey-parliament-approves-plan-to-strengthen-presidential-powers.php">approved a plan</a> [JURIST report] to be voted on later this year which would increase presidential power within the country and would allow President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to stay in office until 2029.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">Donald Trump</a> [official website] on Saturday signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/31/presidential-executive-order-regarding-omnibus-report-significant-trade">executive order</a> [text] directing the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/">Commerce Department</a> [official website] and the <a href="https://ustr.gov/">US Trade Representative</a> [official website] to review all US trade agreements and membership in the <a href="https://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) [official website] to determine the cause of the US trade deficit. The order calls for a comprehensive review of whether previous free trade agreements and membership in the WTO have brought the benefits that were predicted. The order comes three days after Trump <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-trump-nafta-20170426-story.html">announced</a> [AP report] he would not order a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but would rather renegotiate its terms with Canada and Mexico. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/press-briefing-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-executive-order-trade">responded</a> [press briefing] to the order, and stated that an analysis of NAFTA will be a significant part of the required study.</p>

<p>The new executive orders raise the number of executive orders by President Trump since taking office 100 days ago to 32. On Friday Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-order-reducing-restrictions-on-offshore-drilling.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order to lift restrictions placed on offshore oil drilling. Earlier this month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-defunding-of-sanctuary-cities.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Executive Order 13768 which would have allowed the federal government to withhold funds from cities which have been designated as "sanctuary cities." Also in April, Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-order-requiring-federal-agencies-to-favor-us-suppliers.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an order that requires executive agencies to monitor and enforce "Buy American" laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/050117zor_6537.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a>[order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/patchak-v-jewell/">Patchak v. Zinke</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-784.htm">Merit Management v. FTI Consulting</a> [dockets] on Monday. In <em>Patchak</em>, the court will decide if Section 2(b) of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1603/text">Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act</a> [text] violates the separation of powers created in the US Constitution by calling on federal courts to drop cases related to certain provisions of the act. Patchak, petitioner in the case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-498-pet-cert-reply.pdf">argues</a> [reply brief, PDF] that the act violates separation of power principles by excluding a particular class of cases from the jurisdiction of the federal courts through legislation. <a href="https://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretary-ryan-zinke">Ryan Zinke</a> [official profile], in his capacity as Secretary of the Interior, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-498-BIO.pdf">responds</a> [brief in opposition, PDF] that there is no constitutional violation because <blockquote>Under the Constitution, Congress has broad power "to define and limit the jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the United States" ...

Petitioner FTI Consulting <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-784-pet-cert-reply.pdf">argues</a> [reply brief, PDF] that the court should grant review so that debtors, trustees and creditors may organize their affairs and litigation around a uniform interpretation of the safe harbor provision. Respondent Merit Management Group, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/16-784-BIO.pdf">argues</a> [brief in opposition, PDF] that the language in the provision is vague, leading to district courts disagreeing on whether the provision prohibits the avoidance of a settlement payment made in connection with a securities contract where neither the debtor nor the transferee is a financial institution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein</a> [official profile] said Monday that Egypt's recent security measures have been encouraging the very radicalization they were trying to control. In a <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN17X1MK">press conference</a> [Reuters report] in Geneva, al-Hussein criticized the increased security measures <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] has instituted since the bombings of Christian churches last month. While condemning the attacks, al-Hussien said that al-Sisi's declaration of a three-month state of emergency was only going to increase radicalization. Al-Hussein said that the state of emergency was leading to "massive numbers of detentions, reports of torture, and continued arbitrary arrests" which will "facilitat[e] radicalization in prisons." Al-Hussein continued that "the crackdown on civil society through travel bans, freezing orders, [and] anti-protest laws"  is not "the way to fight terror." Al-Hussein finished by saying that "national security ... must be a priority for every country, [but not] at the expense of human rights."</p>

<p>The Parliament of Egypt in April gave its <a href="http://www.nile.eg/%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88">unanimous approval</a> [press release] to a three-month state of emergency in response to two deadly Christian church bombings in the Egyptian cities of Tanta and Alexandria. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> (IS) [BBC backgrounder] took credit for the bombings. The threat to Christians in the Middle East has heightened in past years as radical extremists have increasingly targeted attacks this religious group. In February 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-libya-killings.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the beheading of Coptic Christians in Libya by IS, characterizing the acts as "vile crime[s] targeting people on the basis of their religion." The Egyptian Christians were abducted in two separate incidents, and a released video showed members of IS beheading the captives on a beach. Islamist extremists are believed to be <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/meast/egypt-church-attacks/index.html">behind attacks</a> [CNN report] such as the burning of churches and property owned by Christians, along with the displacement of Christian citizens. Coptic Christians comprise roughly 10 percent of the country's 85 million people. These citizens have become a scapegoat for the ousting of Egyptian ex-president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile], and recent attacks are widely seen as retaliation from Morsi supporters, the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1111_5i36.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-of-america-corp-v-city-of-miami/">Bank of America Corp. v. City of Miami</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that cities can use the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-act-2">Fair Housing Act</a> (FHA) [text] to sue banks for predatory lending practices. At issue were the questions of whether Miami qualified as the kind of party that could bring claims under the FHA and whether the harm the city said it suffered (lost tax revenue) was necessarily tied closely enough to the lending practices for the city to bring the claims. Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Breyer said that the city could bring claims under the FHA, but that a lower court had failed to properly assess whether lost tax revenue was linked closely enough to the lending practices to be covered by the act. The case was sent back to a lower court to decide how closely linked the harm and the lending practices must be to be covered by the FHA. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito, arguing that the kind of harm the city claimed was not the kind for which the FHA intended to provide a remedy. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the decision.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-scope-of-federal-fair-housing-act-fannie-mae.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. The district court had dismissed the city's cases, and the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-1111-Op-Bel-11th-Cir.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF]. The cases were consolidated for appeal to the Supreme Court into <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-1111_ca7d.pdf">Bank of America Corp. v. City of Miami</a> [transcript, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/050117zor_6537.pdf">declined to hear</a> [order list, PDF] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. The <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120705_amended_asm_v93.pdf">law</a> [text, PDF], signed by <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">California Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], became the first of its kind, barring the so-called therapy that aims to change the sexual orientation of patients under 18. Plaintiff <a href="http://www.fcssandiego.com/donaldwelch/">Donald Welch</a> [professional profile] had argued that the California law not only suppresses conservative religious beliefs and practices, but also interferes with a minister's right to provide spiritual counseling to minors. Arguing for the ban, <a href="http://www.eqca.org/">Equality California</a> [advocacy website] Executive Director Rick Zbur said in a <a href="http://www.eqca.org/scotus-conv-ban/">statement </a> [press release] that "the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case of Welch v. Brown is good news for thousands of LGBT youth nationwide, especially those in states without conversion therapy bans." This is the <a href="http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/pickup2.pdf">second time</a> [order, PDF] in three years that the court has refused to hear a challenge to the law and means that the <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/08/29/12-17681.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] made by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] upholding the ban will stay in place.</p>

<p>California has been at the forefront of legislation regarding LGBT rights beyond its ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In July Brown <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/07/california-governor-signs-bill-making-states-marriage-law-gender-neutral.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that will change the language in California's marriage code to accommodate same-sex couples. Also in August the Supreme Court of California <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/08/california-supreme-court-ends-legal-challenges-to-same-sex-marriage.php">ended the last legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] to same-sex marriage in the state by refusing to revive Proposition 8, the state's now-defunct law banning same-sex marriage. The previous month, San Diego County <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/07/california-clerk-asks-state-high-court-to-halt-same-sex-marriages.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] California's supreme court seeking to require certain county clerks to enforce Prop 8, arguing that the US Supreme Court's June 2013 <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">decision </a>[JURIST report] upholding the repeal of Prop 8 only applied to two of the state's 58 counties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] said on Monday that it will not reconsider its ruling to uphold the government's "net neutrality" <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0204/DOC-331869A1.pdf">rules</a> [fact sheet, PDF] that require internet providers to treat all online traffic equally. This means that the rules put in place by the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] under former President Obama will remain in place for the time being. Last <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-net-neutrality-regulations.php">year</a> [JURIST report], a three-judge panel <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3F95E49183E6F8AF85257FD200505A3A/%24file/15-1063-1619173.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 2-1 to uphold regulations that bar service providers from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/appeals-court-says-wont-reconsider-net-neutrality-ruling/">favoring</a> [AP report] certain content or allow rival video-streaming companies to pay more money for faster streaming. In its decision, the appeals court likened Internet service providers to utilities, saying that they should act as "neutral, indiscriminate platforms for transmission of speech." Service providers asked the court to revisit this decision, but the court declined to do so. The FCC under President Donald Trump, who has indicated his intent to remove this Obama-era policy, could refuse to enforce the rules or change the rules completely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/net-neutrality/detail.php">Net neutrality </a>[JURIST backgrounder] has emerged as a major political issue in the US and internationally. In 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17615388436478528143&q=Verizon+v+FCC&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1">ruled</a> [opinion] that the FCC did not have authority to enforce the entire Open Internet Order 2010. Instead, the order could only be applied to common carriers. Earlier this year, more than 170 <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/more-than-170-organizations-sign-letter-urging-net-neutrality.php">organizations</a> [JURIST report] signed a <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/policy-and-litigation/letters-to-government-officials/letter-to-chairman-pai-protect-net-neutrality.pdf">letter</a> urging the FCC to preserve net neutrality. In April of 2014, the European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/european-parliament-approves-net-neutrality-proposal.php#.U1qsYP3-VFx">approved</a> a proposal that prohibited Internet service providers (ISPs) from enhancing or restricting services for selected Internet traffic. The law aimed to treat all Internet traffic equally by making it illegal to block, slow down or give preferential treatment to certain specific applications and services for economic or other reasons.<br />

		<title>HRW: Syria used chemical weapons in multiple attacks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy group <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said Monday that it has found <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/01/death-chemicals/syrian-governments-widespread-and-systematic-use-chemical-weapons">new evidence</a> [HRW report] that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in at least four recent attacks targeting civilians. The groups said that local residents and activist in Khan Sheikhoun identified at least 92 people who likely died from chemical exposure. It also named three pieces of additional evidence to support the finding that the government has been committing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/ictr/4.htm">crimes against humanity</a> [ICC, Rome statute] <blockquote>(1) Government warplanes appear to have dropped bombs with nerve agents on at least four occasions since December 12, including in Khan Sheikhoun; (2) The government&#8217;s use of helicopter-dropped chlorine-filled munitions has become more systematic; and (3) Government or pro-government ground-forces have started using improvised ground-launched munitions containing chlorine.</blockquote> HRW called for the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html"<a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to "immediately adopt a resolution calling on all parties to the Syrian conflict to fully cooperate" with <a href="https://www.opcw.org/">OPCW</a> [official website] investigators and "facilitate their unimpeded access to locations of chemical attacks." The Syrian government has so far refused to fully cooperate with investigations concerning chemical weapons. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact, sparking action from many authorities and human rights groups. In Feburary, according to HRW, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel controlled portions of Aleppo. The same month, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">more than 13,000 prisoners were hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at Saydnaya prison. In December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein [official profile] accused Syrian pro-government forces of going door to door and systematically killing civilians [JURIST report] in at least four Aleppo neighborhoods. In November HRW released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php">hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity. In October France opened a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/france-opens-torture-inquiry-into-syria-government-under-assad.php">torture investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of the Syrian government under Assad in detention facilities. Additionally, Amnesty International released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-us-allies-in-syria-committing-war-crimes.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in October detailing the possibility of war crimes in Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European Commission Brexit Chief Negotiator <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/persons/director-head-service-michel-barnier_en">Michel Barnier</a> [official profile] on Wednesday published the European Union's proposed <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/annex-recommendation-uk-eu-negotiations_3-may-2017_en.pdf">directives</a> [text, PDF] for the UK's departure from the EU, <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-1205_en.htm">saying</a> [statement; <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1170_en.htm">press release</a>] the highest priorities were citizens' rights, financial settlement and border regulation. EU Treaty <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-648_en.htm">Article 50</a> [official backgrounder] governs the departure of a member state from the union, and Barnier emphasized the importance of both sides agreeing to the amount the UK will pay to leave the EU before negotiations advance further. UK Brexit Secretary <a href="http://www.daviddavis.info/">David Davis</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-39789903">expressed skepticism</a> [BBC report] over the amount the EU may seek. The proposed directives will be considered by the EU <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/configurations/gac/">General Affairs Council</a> [official website] on May 22.</p>

<p>There has been controversy surrounding Britain's choice to leave the EU since June when a majority of UK citizens <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to leave the EU due to a growing discontent with EU policies. In March European Union President <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/">Donald Tusk</a> [official website] laid out <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/eu-president-donald-tusk-outlines-future-plans-with-uk-following-brexit.php">earlier plans</a> [JURIST report] for the EU's negotiations with the UK. Also in March the UK Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-publishes-bill-to-replace-eu-laws.php">released the Great Repeal Bill</a> [JURIST report], outlining the process to solve issues that could arise out as Britain leaves the EU. The Brexit bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brexit-bill-receives-royal-assent-and-becomes-law.php">received royal assent</a> [JURIST report] from the Queen earlier in March allowing May to use Article 50 to exit the EU. Implications of Brexit extend well beyond immigration, however. Scottish lawmakers, under the guidance of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/scotland-lawmakers-vote-to-hold-independence-referendum.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 69-59 in favor of holding an independence referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://juntasupervision.pr.gov/index.php/en/home/">Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://juntasupervision.pr.gov/wp-content/uploads/wpfd/49/590a09096cd13.pdf">filed for bankruptcy protection</a> [press release] for the territory following the expiration of provisions that had shielded it from litigation. The filing comes under <a href="http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2016/A-021-2016.pdf">Article 3 of PROMESA</a> [text, PDF], a special law passed last year to allow Puerto Rico to manage its significant debt. The territory has created a <a href="https://juntasupervision.pr.gov/wp-content/uploads/wpfd/50/590a1401cb012.pdf">fiscal plan</a> [text] to address its debt and begun negotiations with many of its debt holders, but the board said the filing was necessary as a number of other creditors started <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSKBN17Z1UC">filing lawsuits</a> [Reuters report] against it earlier in the week:<blockquote>Under PROMESA, the Government of Puerto Rico, with the Oversight Board&#8217;s support, has pursued voluntary negotiations and mediation in an effort to arrive at consensual agreements with its creditors. But the expiration Monday night of the stay against litigation provided by PROMESA makes the government vulnerable to lawsuits by its creditors. The voluntary filing under Title III would preclude those lawsuits while allowing the possibility of consensual negotiations to continue.</blockquote></p>

<p>The debt crisis of Puerto Rico has been extensive and a severe worry to many around the world.  In January, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-puerto-rico-pension-bondholders-case-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a case brought by bondholders of Puerto Rico's Employee Retirement System could proceed. Also in January a UN independent expert warned that increasing austerity measures to the American territory <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-expert-puerto-rico-austerity-measures-undermine-human-rights.php">could threaten residents' human rights</a> [JURIST report]. In June the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-against-puerto-rico-on-debt-restructuring.php">US Supreme Court ruled</a> [JURIST report] 5-2 that Section 903(1) of the Bankruptcy Code preempts Puerto Rico's Recovery Act. Last April the Puerto Rico legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/puerto-rico-legislature-approve-bill-for-fiscal-emergency.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that allowed the island territory to enter into a state of fiscal emergency and begin the process toward a debt moratorium.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Report: NSA collected citizens&#039; phone records despite USA Freedom Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] published a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3688538-FISA-Transparency-Report-April-2017.html">report</a> [text] Tuesday saying that the agency had collected and stored more than 1.5 million civilian phone records in 2016. This report is the first that has been issued since the implementation of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr2048/BILLS-114hr2048enr.pdf">USA Freedom Act</a> [text, PDF] in 2015, which was designed to reduce the number of phone records collected. The report details other information including the number of National Security Letters issued by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website], the amount of call event metadata that was searched and the number of orders that were issued to search business record. Parts of the USA Freedom Act were implemented as portions of the Patriot Act expired and was intended to implement new limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication metadata on US citizens and restore authorization for roving wiretaps and tracking lone wolf terrorists.</p>

<p>The use of communication surveillance continues to be a security rights issue in many countries. In March, the New York Police Department reached a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/settlement-approved-in-nypd-muslim-surveillance-case.php">settlement over its surveillance of Muslims</a> [JURIST report]. The new settlement would create greater oversight of the NYPD's intelligence-gathering programs by a civilian representative. In the original rejection of the case, the judge stated that the agreement did not ensure that the NYPD would be limited in how it could monitor political and religious activity. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Utah refused to dismiss a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rules-nsa-olympic-surveillance-lawsuit-may-continue.php">complaint against the NSA</a> [JURIST report] over allegations of warrantless surveillance during the 2002 winter Olympic games. The case includes individuals who allege their communication devices were searched and seized by the NSA during the games. That same month, the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/european-commission-proposes-stricter-rules-for-electronic-communication.php">proposed rules</a> [JURIST report] to bolster electronic communications as well as to "create new possibilities to process communication data and reinforce trust and security." The <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/according-to-the-european-court.php">European Court of Justice ruled</a> [JURIST report] in December that "[g]eneral and indiscriminate retention" of e-mails and other electronic communications by governments is illegal, in a decision that many believe could create an opportunity for challenges to the UK's Investigatory Powers Bill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Alabama Governor <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/">Kay Ivey</a> [official website] signed a bill into law on Wednesday that will allow religious adoption agencies to refuse to place children with same-sex couples if such relationships violate the religious beliefs of the organization.  Alabama <a href="https://legiscan.com/AL/text/HB24/2017">House Bill 24</a> [text, PDF], now the Alabama Child Placing Agency Inclusion Act, reads "This bill would prohibit the state from refusing to license or renew the license of a child placing agency on the basis that the provider declines to carry out an activity that conflicts with the religious beliefs of the agency."  Ivey <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/new-alabama-law-lets-adoption-groups-turn-away-gays/2017/05/03/db870f9c-305a-11e7-a335-fa0ae1940305_story.html?utm_term=.f486a76d3c15">said</a> [Washington Post report] "This bill is not about discrimination, but instead protects the ability of religious agencies to place vulnerable children in a permanent home."  Before the bill was approved, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy site] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/27/alabama-bill-would-jeopardize-children-need-families">said</a> [press release] the bill "would undermine laws designed to put the best interest of the child at the forefront of placement decisions, and would tie the state's hands as it tries to place children with families who can care for them."  States with similar laws are Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota and Virginia.  </p>

<p>The rights of same-sex couples remains an ongoing issue after the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision.  In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-orders-south-carolina-to-list-both-same-sex-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] South Carolina to list both same-sex parents on a child's birth certificate. In December the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/12/arkansas-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-birth-certificate-law.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] that places only the biological parents on the birth certificate, finding that equal protection was not violated by "acknowledging basic biological truths." In August New York's top court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/new-york-top-court-expands-definition-of-parent.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the definition of "parent" to better accommodate same-sex couples. Last May the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-supreme-court-vacates-ruling-refusing-to-recognize-same-sex-adoption.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption from other states. Last April a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism</a> [official website] Ben Emmerson <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21584&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] Thursday that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights.  He said that Saudi Arabia's definition of terrorism, which includes "endangering 'national unity' or undermining 'the reputation or position of the State'" is over-inclusive and should conform to international law, which says terrorism must include "acts or threats of violence." Emmerson also expressed concern about the reported prosecution of writers and activists for non-violent actions.  He urged Saudi Arabia's government to establish an "independent national security and due process review mechanism" to reexamine those prosecuted for political expression.  Emmerson also voiced concern about Saudi Arabia failing to adequately investigate its counter-terrorism actions in Yemen, which the UN believes accounted for 60 percent of Yemeni civilian casualties.  </p>

<p>Saudi Arabia's justice system has drawn international criticism for perceived human rights abuses in recent years.  In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/saudi-arabia-intensifies-actions-against-human-rights-advocates-and-writers.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Saudi Arabia was intensifying actions against human rights advocates and writers. In January 2015 a Saudi judge sentenced prominent human rights lawyer Walid Abu al-Khair to an <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/saudi-arabia-increases-prison-sentence-for-human-rights-lawyer.php">additional five years in jail</a> [JURIST report] after he refused to show remorse for "showing disrespect" to authorities and creating an unauthorized association. In October 2014 a Saudi Arabia Court sentenced three lawyers to between five and eight years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-3-lawyers-for-criticizing-judiciary.php">criticizing the justice system</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter by accusing authorities of carrying out arbitrary detentions. Earlier that month Amnesty International issued a report claiming that Saudi Arabia persecutes rights activists and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/rights-group-condemns-saudi-arabia-persecution-of-activists.php">silences government critics</a> [JURIST report], especially in the years since the Arab Spring in 2011. In July 2014 then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navy Pillay, <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-arrests-of-saudi-arabia-activists.php">expressed deep concern</a> [JURIST report] over the harsh sentences and detention of peaceful human rights advocates in Saudi Arabia in recent months. <br />

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prominent Thai human right lawyer Prawet Prapanukul <a href="http://prachatai.org/english/node/7118">was charged</a> [advocacy report] Wednesday with 10 counts of breaking <a href="http://library.siam-legal.com/thai-law/criminal-code-royal-family-sections-107-112/"> Article 112 </a> [text] and 3 counts of breaking <a href="http://library.siam-legal.com/thai-law/criminal-code-offense-internal-security-sections-113-118/"> Article 116 </a> [text] of Thailand's criminal code for allegedly insulting members of the royal family. If found guilty of all the charges, Prapanukul  <a href="https://asiancorrespondent.com/2017/05/thailand-missing-lawyer-appears-court-faces-150-years-jail-royal-insult/#eS1uXCkSi89ezXKd.97"> faces</a> [Asian Correspondent report] up to 171 years in prison. Article 112 prohibits defaming, insulting or threatening members of the royal family and is punishable by 15 years in prison for each violation. Article 116 prohibits speech, writings, or other means designed to instigate a violation of the constitution and is punishable by 7 years in prison for each violation. It is currently not clear what Prapanukul said or wrote which led to his arrest and array of charges, which is the largest number of charges an individual has received in recent years. Prapanukul has advocated against Thailand's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29628191"> royalty protection </a> [BBC backgrounder] laws in the past when he provided legal assistance to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268"> United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship </a> [BBC backgrounder] and served as legal counsel for Daranee Charnchoengsilpakul, who was convicted of violating Thailand's laws against insulting the royal family.</p>

<p>Thailand's enforcement of lese majeste laws and stifling of free speech has become increasingly prevalent in the past few years. In February the Supreme Court of Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/thailand-court-upholds-magazine-editors-royal-insult-conviction.php"> upheld </a> [JURIST report] the sentence of a former magazine editor who published stories criticizing the royal family under the lese majeste laws. Earlier in February human rights groups urged the Thai Army to drop <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-groups-urge-thailand-officials-to-drop-charges-against-3-activists.php"> defamation charges </a> [JURIST report] against three activists. Prior to that, UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-not-to-stifle-free-speech.php"> called on </a> [JURIST report] Thai authorities Tuesday to cease using royal defamation laws to counter free speech that is critical of the royal family. In December the Thailand Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/thailand-parliament-passes-controversial-cyber-crime-legislation.php"> passed </a> [JURIST report] a controversial cyber-crimes bill that gave the government the right to obtain user data without court approval, which rights groups feared would give the government unrestricted power to police the web and suppress criticism. In September Thailand's Bangkok South Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailand-court-finds-uk-labor-activist-guilty-of-defamation.php"> found </a> [JURIST report] British labor rights activist Andy Hall guilty of criminal defamation and violating cyber crime laws.About a week earlier the same month Thailand's military government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailand-junta-to-stop-prosecuting-dissidents-in-military-courts.php"> announced </a> [JURIST report] that it will prosecute cases concerning national security and "royal insult" in civilian courts, as opposed to military courts where the cases have been tried since 2014.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump signed an <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/executiveorders/13796.php">executive order</a> [text, JURIST] Thursday relaxing enforcement of rules prohibiting tax-exempt religious groups from engaging in certain kinds of political speech. An existing federal law called the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/charities-churches-and-politics">Johnson Amendment</a> [IRS backgrounder] prohibits tax-exempt religious organizations from campaigning for particular candidates. But interpreting what crosses the line between advocating for certain policies, which is allowed, and advocating for certain candidates, which is not, is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-07-41.pdf">determined</a> [revenue ruling, PDF] by the IRS. Trump's order instructs the IRS to interpret the law in a way more permissive to religious organizations. It also instructs regulatory agencies to consider exempting employers who object to the use of contraceptives from parts of a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-13">federal law</a> [text, LII] that requires employers to provide contraceptive coverage for their employees.</p>

<p>Both issues of religious participation in politics and moral objections to contraceptives have been controversial issues for years. In 2008, a group of pastors <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2008/09/pastors-challenge-us-ban-on-political.php">challenged the rules</a> limiting their speech following IRS reports of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2006/02/illegal-political-activity-by.php">increased illegal political activity</a> [JURIST reports] by religious groups in the 2004 election. in 2014, the US Supreme Court ruled that closely held for-profit corporations <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">can deny coverage of contraceptives</a> [JURIST report] based on their religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll256.xml">voted 217-213</a> [roll call] Thursday to repeal portions of the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA)  [text, PDF] and replace them using the proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/text">American Health Care Act</a> (AHCA) [text]. The AHCA would no longer impose a tax penalty for those who don't have insurance, but would allow insurance companies to charge a penalty when someone buys insurance after it has lapsed for a period. It would replace income-based health insurance tax credits with age-based credits. It would also restrict federal funding to states for <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/program-history/index.html">Medicaid</a> [official backgrounder] and cut taxes that had been used to pay for the funding. Finally, it would provide states with the ability to opt-out of many requirements of the ACA, including no longer requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. US President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/remarks-president-trump-healthcare-vote-house-representatives">said</a> [statement] the bill would reduce insurance premiums and deductibles, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) <a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/5417-6/">said</a> [statement] it would leave 24 million more people without health insurance and lead to higher premiums for vulnerable groups. The bill would need to be approved by the Senate and President before becoming law.</p>

<p>Repealing the ACA has been a significant priority for Trump and Republican lawmakers. In March, an earlier version of the AHCA was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-healthcare-bill-withdrawn-from-congress-due-to-lack-of-votes.php">withdrawn from consideration</a> [JURIST report] after failing to get enough support to pass. Earlier that month, Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/republicans-present-modifications-to-aca-replacement-bill.php">released two amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the AHCA in an effort to appeal to both conservative and liberal critics. Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-senators-propose-first-aca-replacement-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] the initial ACA replacement bill at the end of January. This came after President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-issues-executive-order-seeking-repeal-of-aca.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] aimed at repealing the ACA, shortly after being sworn in. The Senate had prepared for the repealing of the ACA earlier that month when it <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/senate-takes-first-step-to-repeal-acaa.php">voted 51-48</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the process from being subject to a filibuster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has launched a criminal investigation into <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber Technologies Inc.</a> [official website] for the use of a software tool that helped drivers evade local transport regulators, according to a Thursday <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-crime-exclusive-idUSKBN1802U1">report</a> [text] by Reuters. The software, known as "Greyball", was part of a larger system named Violation of Terms of Service that analyzed credit card, device identification, location data and other factors to predict whether a ride was legitimate. Greyball would use this same method to detect if a ride was potentially a law enforcement agent. Portland officials reported that Uber had used Greyball to evade 16 transportation officials by denying them dozens of rides. Uber admitted to using the technology in Portland during 2014 before they were approved to operate within the city. According to Reuters' sources, the investigation has included grand jury subpoenas, but is otherwise in its early stages.</p>

<p>With the rapid growth of companies like Lyft and Uber, ride-sharing services have been among the most <a href="feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. In April, The Missouri State House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/missouri-house-approves-statewide-laws-for-ride-sharing.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to standardize state-wide ride sharing rules. Earlier in April, The US District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a preliminary injunction to block Seattle's law that would allow drivers for taxis, Lyft and Uber to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-seattle-ride-sharing-union-law.php">unionize</a> [JURIST report]. In March a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-approves-class-action-settlement-with-lyft-drivers.php">$27 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit between Lyft and its drivers. The suit challenged Lyft's characterization of the drivers as independent contractors. In December the European wing of Uber was <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in Denmark on charges of assisting drivers in their violation of taxi laws, although Copenhagen prosecutor Vibeke Thorkil-Jensen stated that this is just a test case seeking judicial assessment of Uber's involvement in the illegal acts of two of its drivers. Last April Uber <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/uber-reaches-settlement-with-drivers-in-labor-dispute.php">settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by 385,000 drivers in California and Massachusetts regarding their status as independent contractors. In several states, ride-sharing companies have met significant legal opposition, frequently led by competitors such as the taxi industry. Other <a href="/feature/2015/11/future-of-ride-sharing.php">unresolved questions</a> [JURIST backgrounder] surrounding this new business model continue to prompt debate among lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2017-05-05_1493976928.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] death sentences on Friday for four men who fatally gang raped a woman in 2012. The group, five men and a juvenile, lured the young woman, a para-medical student, and her friend onto a bus in New Dehli whereupon they repeatedly raped the woman before beating both her and her friend with a metal bar. Two weeks later the woman died from internal injuries in a Singapore hospital. Four of the attackers were sentenced to death in 2013, the fifth having hanged himself in prison during the seven-month trial. The juvenile was charged with the maximum sentence allowed for a minor and was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/youngest-participant-in-delhi-gang-rape-free.php">freed</a> [JURIST report] from jail after serving three years. Opponents of capital punishment argue that the judges were pressured by media and the public to uphold the sentence. As there a many convictions for rapists and murderers that did not receive the death penalty, critics of the decision assert that the ruling was subjective and will therefore not serve as a sufficient deterrent. </p>

<p>The crime prompted thousands of women across India to break their silence over unreported sexual violence. There has been a flurry of incidents involving gang-rapes of women in India the past few years, prompting the government to reform the <a href="/dateline/2013/04/kim-brancato-human-rights.php">criminal legal code</a> regarding sexual violence [JURIST op-ed]. Prominent human rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites] have <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/rights-groups-urge-india-to-reject-new-sexual-violence-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] various aspects of the new laws stating that India has only reformed the most archaic of its laws and has failed to meet international standards for women's rights. In 2015, police registered more than 34,000 rape complaints. In January a court in India <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/india-court-convicts-six-in-2013-gang-rape-and-murder-of-20-year-old-college-student.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] six of the eight accused of gang raping and murdering a 20-year-old college student in the Kamduni village district of the state of West Bengal. Also in January Indian police were <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/india-police-accused-of-raping-at-least-16-women.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of raping at least 16 women in Chhattisgarh in Bijapur district in October 2015. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] issued a <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/05/270676.htm">press release</a> [text] Friday expressing concern over the prolonged pretrial detention of five Cambodian activists. Four members of the <a href="http://www.adhoc-cambodia.org/">Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association</a> (ADHOC) [official website], along with one former member, have been held by Cambodian authorities for over a year, without receiving a trial. The defenders were detained in May 2016 over allegations that they assisted a woman accused of making false claims while under pressure from the Anti-Corruption Unit. The US joins the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21116&LangID=E">UN </a>and the <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/20170504_eu_loca_statement.pdf">EU</a> [statements] in calling on the Cambodian government to immediately release all five activists. The US cited harm being done to the families of those detained. The US echoed the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/Opinions/Session77/A-HRC-WGAD-2016-45_en.pdf">views</a> [text, PDF] expressed by <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website], which found these detentions to be arbitrary in 2016. The charges are <a href="http://staging.hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_CAMBODIA_US_DETAINED_ACTIVISTS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-05-06-08-02-19">alleged</a> [AP report] to be politically motivated.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have caused international concern. In January UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-experts-call-for-immediate-release-of-five-human-rights-defenders-in-cambodia.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding the intimidation of opposition politicians and peaceful protesters in Cambodia. The prime minister of Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/cambodia-pm-sues-opposition-leaders.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August alleging defamation against an opposition leader and opposition party leader. In November 2015 the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Rhona Smith, <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-warns-cambodias-political-polarization-reaching-breaking-point.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the increasing polarization of the political parties in Cambodia is reaching a breaking point. In October 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.dallascounty.org/department/sheriff/sheriff_index.php">Dallas County Sheriff's Department</a> [official website] issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/Dallas_Sheriff/status/860652150736736256/photo/1">arrest warrant</a> [press release, Twitter] Friday for former Police Officer Roy Oliver over the murder of Jordan Edwards, a young black man. Oliver turned himself in that night. Roy Oliver was a Police Officer with the <a href="http://balchspringspd.com/">Balch Springs Police Department</a> [official website] in Texas when he fatally shot the high school freshman on April 29. Edwards was the front passenger in a vehicle leaving a house party after police arrived shortly before midnight. Oliver was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BalchSpringsPoliceDepartment/photos/a.404190103022068.1073741825.404187409689004/1287269578047445/?type=3">terminated </a> [press release, Facebook] on May 2 after the completion of an Internal Affairs investigation. In a press release, the Dallas County Sheriff's Office stated that the warrant was issued after evidence suggested that Oliver fired into the vehicle intending to cause serious injury and to commit an act "clearly dangerous to human life." In an updated press release by the Balch Springs Police Department, the vehicle is described as driving away from police at the time of the shooting. An<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/us/roy-oliver-charged-murder-dallas-police-shooting-jordan-edwards.html"> earlier description</a> [NYT report] stated that the vehicle was reversing toward the officers. Dallas police have said that the investigation into the death of Jordan Edwards will not stop at this arrest.</p>

<p>Jordan Edwards is the latest, high-profile fatality of a Black teenager shot by police in the US. In 2013 the UN Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent and the UN Special Rapporteur on racism <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-experts-urge-us-finalize-zimmerman-trial-investigation.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] the US government to finalize its investigation into the case surrounding the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. In 2014 a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, decided <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">not to indict</a> [JURIST report] police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown in August of that year. In 2015 Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/chicago-police-officer-charged-with-first-degree-murder.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with first-degree murder for the death of black teenager Laquan McDonald in October 2014.  That same year an Ohio grand jury decided <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.cnccep.fr/index.html"> National Control Commission for the Election Campaign for the Presidential Election (CNCCEP)</a> [official website, in French] on Saturday <a href="http://www.cnccep.fr/communiques/cp15.html">cautioned</a> [press release, in French] media outlets against sharing information leaked from an alleged hack of a presidential candidate. The hackers have claimed to have stolen an estimated 9 gigabytes of data from the <a href="https://en-marche.fr/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> [official profile, in French] campaign and the Macron-backed <a href="https://en-marche.fr/">En Marche Party</a> [official website, in French], although this information is yet to be verified. The leak spread with "#MacronLeaks" on social media. The CNCCEP warning reminded that French law forbids interference into elections and that a journalist may face criminal charges if they release any report on the information to the public. The CNCCEP stated [French translation]:</p>

<blockquote>On the eve of the most important election deadline for our institutions, it calls on all actors present on websites and social networks, first and foremost the media, but also all citizens, Of responsibility and not to relay these contents, in order not to alter the sincerity of the vote, not to break the prohibitions laid down by the law and not to expose oneself to the commission of criminal offenses.</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, as the laws prevent continued campaigning, Macron is prohibited by law from speaking on the alleged hacking until the election is over. </p>

<p>The number of instances of hacking, specifically as it relates to the political and/or governmental spectrum, has increased substantially in recent years posing significant<a href="/feature/2017/02/social-and-legal-implications.php"> social and legal implications</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that transcend international borders. Last month Roman Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russian-man-receives-longest-ever-cybercrime-sentence.php">was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 27 years in prison for hacking into more than 500 US businesses, and stealing and selling millions of credit card numbers. Earlier the same month the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/doj-disables-kelihos-botnet-after-arrest-of-russia-hacker.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it had effectively disrupted the Kelihos botnet, a network of thousands of virus ridden computers used to glean personal information and login credentials by distributing malicious software through spam emails. The week before that announcement Peter Yuryevich Levashov, long thought to be the creator of the Kelihos botnet, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-botnet-idUSKBN17C2B4">arrested</a> [Reuters report] in Spain on charges purportedly related to US claims that Russia interfered with the November 2016 US election. In March the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/senate-holds-first-hearing-on-russia-involvement-in-election.php">held hearings</a> [JURIST report] on seeking to determine the level of Russian involvement in the election, one week after the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives">FBI Director James Comey</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] it had begun investigating Russian interference. Earlier the same month the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-charges-russian-officers-for-hacking-email-accounts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] indictments for four Russian hackers in March related to an email hacking incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tennessee <a href="https://www.tn.gov/governor/">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.tn.gov/news/50270">signed</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/110/Bill/SB1085.pdf">SB 1085</a> [text, PDF] into law which mandates that undefined laws be given their natural and ordinary meaning. Dubbed the "natural and ordinary meaning" law, it requires that "undefined words be given their natural and ordinary meaning, without forced or subtle construction that would limit or extend the meaning of the language, except when a contrary intention is clearly manifest." Some rights groups, such as the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="http://www.hrc.org/blog/anti-lgbtq-bills-in-tennessee-attempt-to-undermine-supreme-courts-marriage/">raised concerns</a> [HRC report] that this new law could create conflicts with LGBT protections and gay marriage provisions. In response to these concerns, Haslam stated: </p>

<blockquote>Using a word's ordinary meaning is a well-established principle of statutory construction. While I understand the concerns raised about this bill, the Obergefell decision is the law of the land, and this legislation does not change a principle relied upon by the courts for more than a century, mitigating the substantive impact of this legislation. Because of that I have signed HB 1111/SB 1085 into law.</blockquote>

<p>The concept of giving laws their "natural and ordinary" meaning derives from the idea of "textualism," of which the late Justice Antonin Scalia was an ardent advocate. More than en years ago, Scalia <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/scalia-defends-constitutional-approach.php">engaged in a rare televised debate</a> [JURIST report] with the former president of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.nyls.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/faculty_profiles/nadine_strossen/">Nadine Strossen</a> [official profile]. The two clashed on issues of constitutional interpretation and fundamental rights, with Scalia defending his "textualist" approach [backgrounder] to constitutional interpretation, which asks what constitutional language meant at the time it was adopted. Strossen had then responded: "I'm very distressed about your failure to find protections in the Constitution for the right of consenting individuals in their homes to decide what they see and read, and what type of sexual relations they have." LGBT protections are still disputed globally and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against "unlawful assembly" and the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. The same week <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and other advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a><br />
 [JURIST report] UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary General António Guterres</a> [official website] to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. A week earlier the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/news/signature/23490">signed</a> [signing statement, text; <a href="mailto:https://www.facebook.com/TexasGovernor/videos/10155316084703256/">video</a>] into law a <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [SB 4, text] banning so-called "sanctuary cities" in the state. Under the law, municipal officials who fail to assist with federal immigration enforcement could face civil penalties, removal from office and criminal charges. Abbot said the law was needed to maintain public safety in the state: <blockquote>As Governor, my top priority is public safety, and this bill furthers that objective by keeping dangerous criminals off our streets ... It's inexcusable to release individuals from jail that have been charged with heinous crimes like sexual assault against minors, domestic violence and robbery. There are deadly consequences to not enforcing the law, and Texas has now become a state where those practices are not tolerated. With this bill we are doing away with those that seek to promote lawlessness in Texas.</blockquote>The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/texas-state-house-approves-ban-on-sanctuary-cities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Texas House of Representatives last month and will take effect on September 1.</p>

<p>Since the election of US President Donald Trump, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">continue to stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In March the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies.  In February, the Alabama House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. In the same month, Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/texas-senate-approves-bill-targeting-sanctuary-cities.php">approved a bill targeting sanctuary cities </a>[JURIST report] by requiring them to comply with federal immigration law. Earlier in February San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding</a> [JURIST report] from sanctuary cities. In January, San Francisco's police chef was <a href="paperchase/2017/01/san-francisco-sued-by-undocumented-immigrant-over-violation-of-sanctuary-city-law.php">sued by an undocumented El Salvadorian over the city's sanctuary protection laws</a> [JURIST report]. Also in January, the New York Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/new-york-ag-proposes-model-language-for-laws-and-policies-regarding-immigration.php">proposed model language</a> [JURIST report] for immigration laws and policies in sanctuary cities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese human rights lawyer detained in the city of Changsha since 2015 pleaded guilty Monday to incitement to subversion and disturbing legal proceedings. Prosecutors <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/08/c_136265623.htm">accused</a> [Xinhua report] Xie Yang of conspiring with people in and out of China to distort reports of police brutality, with the ultimate goals of undermining state power and threatening national security. Xie's wife has publicly <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1840JP?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that the trial was a sham, that Xie's supporters were barred from accessing the proceedings, and that he is innocent of the charges. The Changsha Intermediate People's Court released a video of Xie's statement, in which he also encourages lawyers to abide by the law and says that he was not forced to confess. In January, however, Xie stated through his lawyers that he was was beaten and deprived of sleep while in custody.</p>

<p>China has faced continued international criticism for its treatment of human rights defenders, ranging from filing of arbitrary criminal charges, suspension or dismissal of law licenses, and disappearances. In February, the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report] highlighting intensified crackdowns on human rights defenders. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of human rights lawyer</a> [JURIST report] Jiang Tianyong, after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. Last September China <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">handed down a 12 year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July China announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/courts/ca4/17-1351-20170508.mp3">oral arguments</a> [audio, MP3] on Monday regarding President Donald Trump's immigration executive order. The Trump Administration is appealing a Maryland court ruling in March which placed a temporary ban on Trump's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">Executive Order 13780</a> [text], also known as the "revised travel ban." The plaintiffs in the case <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKBN1840ZM?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">argue</a> [Reuters report] that the executive order violates immigration law and the First Amendment freedom of religion. The government, however, maintains that the immigration executive order was enacted due to national security.</p>

<p>As with Trump's last travel ban, the new immigration order has been highly controversial. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/massachusetts-to-join-lawsuit-against-revised-travel-ban.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/california-joins-multi-state-lawsuit-against-revised-immigration-order.php">California</a> [JURIST reports], Maryland, New York, Oregon and <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-attorney-general-asks-judge-to-block-new-travel-ban.php">Washington</a> joined in a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] opposing the ban. These lawsuits are premised on what JURIST guest columnist Jonathan Hafetz described as underlying <a href="/forum/2017/03/jonathan-hafetz-trump-travel.php">racial discrimination</a> [JURIST report] in the ban. Weeks after the Maryland court ruling, 13 states came out <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/13-states-back-trump-travel-ban-in-court-filing.php">in support of the revised travel ban</a> [JURIST report] by filing a brief with the court stating that the president lawfully acted in the interest of national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/russian-interference-in-the-2016-united-states-election">testified</a> [materials] before a Senate judiciary subcommittee on Monday stating that she had warned about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's vulnerabilities to blackmail by Russia less than a week after <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] assumed office. Flynn's conversations with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to US was a primary focus of the Yates's testimony. Flynn had denied discussing with Kislyak the subject of US sanctions on Russia for the November election interference, but high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials had recorded conversations between Kislyak and Flynn. Yates stated that she has no way of knowing "what, if anything" was done about the matter, and that "If nothing was done, then certainly that would be concerning." This development comes after former president <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/">Barrack Obama</a> [official website] said he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/us/politics/obama-flynn-trump.html">warned Trump not to hire Flynn</a> [NYT report]. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer minimized the warnings saying that "If President Obama was truly concerned about General Flynn, why didn't they suspend his security clearance, which they approved just months earlier?"</p>

<p>In late March Flynn <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-nsc-advisor-michael-flynn-requests-immunity-in-exchange-for-testimony.php">requested immunity</a> [JURIST report] in exchange for his potential testimony on Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, according to a <a href="/paperchase/Statement%20of%20Counsel%20to%20Mike%20Flynn.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent from his attorney, Robert Kelner. Allegations of Russian connections have been a problem for the Trump administration in the early stages of his presidency. The previous week, FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the FBI is investigating allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election. Earlier the same month <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">US Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recused himself</a> [JURIST report] from probes into Russian interference after it was revealed that he had <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">met with Russian officials</a> [JURIST reports] during the campaign. In January a group of US Senators introduced legislation seeking to make <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/white-house-announces-sanctions-against-russia-for-election-hacking.php">mandatory sanctions enacted</a> [JURIST reports] in December by then-president Barack Obama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Jakarta Governor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37872151">Basuki "Ahok" Tjahaja Purnama</a> [BBC backgrounder] was sentenced Tuesday to two years in prison after being found guilty of <a href="https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/idn/indonesian_penal_code_html/I.1_Criminal_Code.pdf">blasphemy</a> [Criminal Code Article 156, PDF] by an <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/index.php?page=web.Beranda&menu=1">Indonesian court</a> [official website]. Ahok is Christian and the charges came as a result of his reference to a Qur'an verse used by conservative leaders to justify the claim that Muslims should not be led by non-Muslims. Ahok <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/09/ahok-taken-to-cipinang-detention-center.html">was detained</a> [Jakarta Post report] immediately following the verdict, drawing criticism from  <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fbzbSOOssaUJ:https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA2153532016ENGLISH.pdf+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=safari">human rights groups</a> [AI press release, PDF] and praise from members of conservative Islamic groups. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=blasphemy&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] have been a controversial issue in several countries. In 2010, the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/03/ireland-justice-minister-proposes.php">proposed referendum</a> [JURIST report] to remove the criminal offense of blasphemy from the Irish Constitution, and in 2008, the UK House of Lords <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php">voted to abolish</a> [JURIST report] the criminal offenses of blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the UK common law. Earlier this year, however, a Sharia high court in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/nigerian-shariah-court-sentences-10-to-death-for-blasphemy.php">sentenced cleric Abdulaziz Dauda and nine others to death</a> [JURIST report] for committing blasphemy against the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and this past February, a Pakistani man was executed for his part in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/pakistan-top-court-upholds-death-sentence-in-blasphemy-killing.php">murdering a politician</a> [JURIST report] who supported a Christian who had been convicted of blasphemy.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy group <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/05/08/us-detention-hazardous-immigrants-health">warned</a> [press release; <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/08/systemic-indifference/dangerous-substandard-medical-care-us-immigration-detention">report</a>] Monday that there are "systemic failures, such as unreasonable delays in care and unqualified medical staff leading to "dangerously subpar" medical care in US immigration detention centers. The group expressed concerns about the Trump administration's plans to detain an even higher number of immigrants, which HRW believes will result in more "needless and preventable deaths." The group documented numerous incidents of "substandard and dangerous" medical care, including failure to follow up on symptoms that required attention; over-reliance on unqualified medical staff; delays in emergency responses and requests for medical care; and the misuse of solitary confinement for people with mental health conditions. According to the report, this type of substandard care contributed to seven of the 18 deaths in the detention centers. </p>

<p>The rights of refugee and migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. In January the Slovenian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-slovenia-strips-refugees-of-protections.php">passed amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the Aliens Act to enact emergency measures to deny refugees entry into the country and to expel those whom did not have their asylum claims properly assessed. Also in January US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/17-state-ags-denounce-trump-immigration-order.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an executive order restricting access to the US for refugees and visa holders from seven countries. In November experts questioned humanitarian conditions at Grecian migrant camps when a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/2-asylum-seekers-killed-in-fire-at-greece-migrant-camp.php">66-year-old woman and six-year-old boy died</a> [JURIST report] in a camp fire. In April 2016 several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also in April 2016 HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the first deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was "riddled with an array of irregularities." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ireland Health Minister <a href="http://www.simonharris.ie">Simon Harris</a> [official profile] said Monday  that the country's <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/print#part5">blasphemy laws</a> [Defamation Act, text] were "embarrassing" and called for their repeal. His <a href="http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/irelands-blasphemy-laws-are-embarrassing-and-need-to-be-repealed-minister-harris-35691694.html">comments</a> follow the <a href="http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/garda-launch-blasphemy-probe-into-stephen-fry-comments-on-the-meaning-of-life-35684262.html">revelation that an investigation</a> [Independent Ireland reports] had been launched into British actor, Stephen Frye concerning comments he made on RTE in March of 2015. Harris said that the actor "regardless of your own religious views, was clearly making a number of points that he clearly felt very strongly about in his usual witty way. I think we do need a referendum." </p>

<p><br />
In March Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/pakistan-pm-blasphemy-on-social-media-must-be-punished.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that blasphemy is an "unpardonable offense" and ordered the state to remove such content from social media. Last year a sharia high court in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/nigerian-shariah-court-sentences-10-to-death-for-blasphemy.php">sentenced </a>[JURIST report] cleric Abdulaziz Dauda and nine others to death by hanging for committing blasphemy against the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. In October the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye said that governments are "wielding the tools of censorship" and <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-criticizes-widespread-censorship-laws.php">cautioned</a> [JURIST report] that "the freedom of expression is under the widespread assault." In 2015 a Pakistani man was executed for his part in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/pakistan-top-court-upholds-death-sentence-in-blasphemy-killing.php">murdering a politician </a>[JURIST report] who supported a Christian who had been convicted of blasphemy. Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the Indonesian Parliament in 2015 to reject proposed amendments to its law on the "eradication of terrorism." HRW asserted that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-proposed-amendments-to-indonesia-terror-law-threaten-human-rights.php">proposed amendments are too vague</a> [JURIST report] and would limit the exercise of free expression and directly conflict with Indonesia's obligations to international human rights, leading to fundamental rights violations. And in 2010 HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hrw-urges-repeal-of-pakistan-blasphemy-laws.php">urged the repeal of all such laws</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sends-justice-karnan-to-6-months-in-jail-for-contempt-of-court/articleshow/58588872.cms">ordered</a> [Times of India report] the judge to be taken into custody immediately as "[w]hosoever commits contempt gets punished." The judge was set to retire in June, however, he will serve out the rest of his term incarcerated.

Trump said he acted under direction from both the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711116/White-House-Fires-James-Comey.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] written to former FBI Director states that his leadership was ineffective and that a new leader is needed to restore public trust and confidence in law enforcement. Comey was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-comey-idUSKBN1852MV">leading</a> [Reuters report] the investigation into Trump's presidential campaign possible collusion with Russia. According to Trump, he fired Comey due to his handling of the email scandal regarding presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Democrats and some others, however, said they believe the move was intended to hinder an FBI investigation into alleged ties between the Trump administration and Russia.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's election campaign and political run has faced a lot of scrutiny. In November state democrats <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/11/voter-intimidation-injunction-pennsylvania-230901">raised voter intimidation suits</a> in six states [Politico report], yet only a federal judge in Ohio granted the requested injunction before being <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-appeals-court-stays-order-blocking-voter-intimidation-ativities-in-ohio.php">rejected on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. In April a federal judge<a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rejects-president-trumps-free-speech-defense-to-rally-violence.php"> rejected Trump's free speech defense</a> in response to his alleged inciting of violence among protestors during his presidential campaign. Trump's travel ban <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/appeals-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-revised-travel-ban-appeal.php">continues to opposed</a> [JURIST report] by several states as a violation of immigration law and the First Amendment freedom of religion. Also, Trump's administration has been plagued with <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-ag-yates-tells-senate-she-warned-of-flynn-vulnerability.php">allegations</a> JURIST report] of his collusion with Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=25590"> passed a bill</a> [text] on Tuesday that would reinstate the death penalty. The House voted a 24-16 on House Bill 125, designated the <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=25590&legislationTypeId=1&docTypeId=2&legislationName=HB125">Extreme Crimes Protection Act</a> [text]. The bill requires juries to unanimously agree that aggravating circumstances in a murder warrant a death sentence. Sponsors of the bill hope that this amendment will address issues raised last year that caused Delaware's capital punishment law to be labeled <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/6519">unconstitutional</a> [advocacy press release]. The bill now heads to the Senate.</p>

<p>The death penalty continues to be a point of contention across the United States. In April Amnesty International released an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF] revealing the US to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. However, in March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. That same month, Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. In April the <a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/">Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/texas-sues-fda-to-release-seized-lethal-injection-drugs.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> [official website] for banning a shipment of lethal injection drugs to prison officials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese human rights lawyers Xie Yang and Li Heping were released from prison Tuesday after being detained for nearly two years on charges of attempting to subvert the country's ruling Communist Party. The two activists were originally rounded up in July of 2015, along with hundreds of other activists and lawyers, in the so-called <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/china-state-media-detained-lawyers-threatened-rule-of-law.php">"7-09 Crackdown"</a> [JURIST report].  A <a href="http://t.cn/RaqFPUT">video</a> [materials, Weibo] released by the <a href="http://cszy.chinacourt.org/index.shtml">Changsha Intermediate People's Court</a> [official website] shows Xie reading a <a href="http://cszy.chinacourt.org/article/detail/2017/05/id/2851452.shtml">prepared statement</a> [materials] before his release in which he appears to retract previous statements that he was tortured and denounces his activism. A <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/2017/05/china-must-drop-all-charges-against-lawyer-xie-yang/">statement from the Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> [advocate website], an organization that has closely followed events following the "7-09 Crackdown," refers to Xie's statement and the quick trial that preceded it a "mockery of justice." Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/china-human-rights-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to-subversion.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Xie of conspiring with people in and out of China to distort reports of police brutality, with the ultimate goals of undermining state power and threatening national security. Friends of Li say he is now with his wife and daughter at their family home in Beijing, adding that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/10/emaciated-unrecognisable-china-releases-human-rights-lawyer-from-custody">he appears "emaciated" and "unrecognizable"</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhangDajun/status/861953749396451329">videos</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhangDajun/status/861963820566269952">photos</a> [materials, Twitter] that have been shared on social media. </p>

<p>China has faced continued international criticism for its treatment of human rights defenders, ranging from filing of arbitrary criminal charges, suspension or dismissal of law licenses, and disappearances. In February, the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report] highlighting intensified crackdowns on human rights defenders.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Wenesday <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19428.pdf">scheduled a public hearing</a> [press release] to resolve a dispute over an Indian man accused of spying after <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19420.pdf">receiving notice</a> [press release] from Indian officials that a Pakistani military court has <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php">sentenced the man to death</a> [JURIST report]. Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, an Indian national and former member of the Indian Navy, has been in custody in Pakistan since March of 2016. Pakistani officials claim that Jadhav was detained in Balochistan province following his "involvement in espionage and terrorist activities," while India's request to the ICJ claims he was "kidnapped" in Iran. In their request, which asks the ICJ to <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19426.pdf">stay Jadhav's execution until the matter is resolved</a> [statement], India claims that Pakistan has violated numerous provisions of the Vienna Convention by failing to grant consular access to Jadhav, failing to inform him of his rights, and failing to inform Indian officials of his detention and charges until long after his arrest. <blockquote>[India] states that Mr. Jadhav will be subjected to execution unless the Court indicates provisional measures directing the Government of Pakistan to take all measures necessary to ensure that he is not executed until th[e] Court's decision on the merits of the case. India points out that Mr. Jadha's execution would cause irreparable prejudice to the rights claimed by India.</blockquote>The hearing is set for May 15.</p>

<p>The Pakistani military court that sentenced Jadhav to death is one of nine courts established in January of last year after Taliban militants attacked children in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30505448">Peshawar school massacre</a> [BBC archive; <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/h/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-savage-extremism-of-taliban-insurgents.php">JURIST report</a>], killing 134 students and 19 adults. Military power was subsequently expanded, giving military courts jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism despite the country's civilian government. Critics argue that the new procedures defer too much power to the military. Allegations of torture and judicial abuse were widespread during the reign of previous Pakistani military courts. However, many Pakistanis support the military courts due to the crumbling civilian system. Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December 2014 in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] that month, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, in March of last year the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">are minors</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Canadian Federal Court ruled on Wednesday that certain provisions of the <a href="https://www.cba.org/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=97a417ea-9a17-446d-be2b-5a8ec6769aaf">Citizen Act</a> [text] violate principles of fundamental justice under Canada's<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-12.3/FullText.html"> Bill of Rights</a> [text]. <a href="http://cas-cdc-www02.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Gagne">Judge Jocelyne Gagne</a> [official website], who ruled over eight cases involving the law, struck down provisions that prevented people from challenging their loss of Canadian status over alleged lies on residency or citizenship applications. Additionally, these provisions barred those who lost citizenship from reapplying for citizenship for ten years. These cases <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3441476/stripping-people-of-canadian-citizenship-without-hearing-is-unfair-judge/">challenged</a> [Canadian Press report] the law's intolerance of allowing those stripped of their residency or citizenship from having their case heard in front of an independent and impartial adjudicator. The final ruling stated that those stripped of their residency or citizenship status are entitled to a hearing before an administrative tribunal in which they have a right to defend themselves. This decision will prevent the <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/department/minister/index.asp">Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</a> [official website] from deciding to revoke someone's citizenship on their own and without a trial.</p>

<p>The Citizenship Act has been under attack since the new, more liberal government has taken control. The act, also known as bill C-24, was passed in June of 2014, which made eligibility requirements for immigrants seeking citizenship stricter than in the <a href="http://www.cicnews.com/2016/05/government-canada-aims-pass-canadian-citizenship-act-law-july-1-058036.html">past</a> [CIC report]. The government has proposed various provisions to the Act to make it easier for those seeking citizenship in the country. These provisions would potentially abolish the requirements of: physical residence for 3 to 5 years prior to application, language requirements for those between the ages of 18-54, taking an oath of citizenship, among many others. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Brazilian President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10841416">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> [BBC profile] appeared in Court on Wednesday and gave a four-hour deposition on the graft charges he faces. In the deposition, da Silva< a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-lula-idUSKBN186239">criticized the charges</a> [Reuters report] as "illegitimate" and a "farce," claiming that the Brazilian media wants to get him "dead or alive". Three years ago, da Silva was charged with receiving $1.1 million in improvements and expenses from a construction company for a beachfront apartment in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-former-president-to-be-tried-on-corruption-charges.php">exchange</a> [JURIST report] for kickbacks from the state-run oil company Petrobras, which has become known as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/business/international/effects-of-petrobras-scandal-leave-brazilians-lamenting-a-lost-dream.html">Petrobas Oil Scandal</a> [NYT report]. Prosecutors in the case allege that businesses paid a total of over <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/brazil-ex-president-to-be-questioned-in-petrobras-case.php">$2 billion</a> [JURIST report], which they then exploited by running up costs and delaying completion.  Despite da Silva's repeated denial of any involvement, federal prosecutors say that da Silva allegedly funneled millions of dollars into the campaigns of those in the Workers Party. Da Silva has also been charged in four other corruption cases.</p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal, including the chief of staff under Brazil's former President Jose Dirceu, former speaker of the house <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/brazil-ex-president-faces-corruption-charges-linked-to-petrobras.php">Eduardo Cunha</a> [JURIST report], and the former president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fernando-Collor-de-Mello">Fernando Collor de Mellon</a> [Britannica profile]. In November of 2015, Brazil's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/brazil-arrests-politician-and-investment-banker-in-corruption-investigation.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the arrest of André Esteves, the chief executive of the country's largest investment bank, and that of Delcídio do Amaral, a powerful senator of the country's ruling party, both accused of bribery and corruption affiliated with Petrobras.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magistrate James Eremye Mawanda of the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ug/data/causelist/51/Nakawa%20Chief%20Magistrate%20Court.html">Nakawa Chief Magistrate Court</a> [court website] on Wednesday released a jailed academic on bail after she had been arrested for criticizing Ugandan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12421747">Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile]. Stella Nyanzi, who teaches at a local college in Kampala, was arrested after criticizing the Ugandan leader over failing to deliver on a promise to provide female students with feminine hygiene products to help them to attend all their classes. Nyanzi was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-uganda-politics-idUSKBN186275">granted bail</a> [Reuters report] after her health deteriorated. She was also ordered to turn over her passport will receive a psychiatric examination to determine if she is fit tostand trial. </p>

<p>Museveni has been in power in the country since becoming president in 1986. His time in charge has led to many rights groups criticizing the leader for a lack of democracy in the African nation. In March <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-calls-for-independent-investigation-into-uganda-killings.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the deaths of over 150 people in the country in what some believe to be an exercise of the leader's power. In 2016 it seemed as though as there was another attempt to eliminate vocal threats to power when the country <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/uganda-charges-opposition-leader-with-treason.php">jailed the main opposition</a> [JURIST report] leader after an election in which Museveni won. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attorneys for US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-f33f-de0a-a15f-ffbf45ad0001">asked</a> [motion, PDF] for a dismissal of a <a href="http://courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Emoluments.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, pdf] over an alleged infringement of the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/68/emoluments-clause">Emoluments Clause</a> [text] of the constitution. Lawyers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/trump-says-d-c-wine-bar-can-t-sue-him-over-unfair-competition">argued</a> [Bloomberg report] that the President has "absolute presidential immunity precludes personal liability based on the president's office". The lawsuit was filed by a wine bar over the implications the Presidents new hotel will have when effecting local business. The attorneys for the wine bar believe that the President will not be immune, as the exemption does not apply to personal acts that effect private business. It is being claimed that there are improper benefits being received by the Hotel drawing international customers in order to curry favor to the President, in turn creating an economic burden on other local business. </p>

<p>President Trump continues to face legal challenges both personally and to some of his administration's actions within the early days of his presidency. In April a federal judge<a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-defunding-of-sanctuary-cities.php"> granted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] over a Trump executive order targeting the funding of sanctuary cities. This was just another challenge to one of the key Trump goals of targeting immigration. Trump is facing multiple <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/restaurant-group-joins-emoluments-suit-against-trump.php">challenges</a> [JURIST report] over alleged infringements over the emoluments clause. Though the President has been challenged over executive orders and alleged violations of the emoluments clause, the legal challenges in recent months have not been limited to these types of challenges. President Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-lawyers-argue-immunity-for-protest-lawsuit.php">called for immunity</a> [JURIST report] over a protest lawsuit where the charge is that then campaigning Trump incited violence at one of his rallies. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acting <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] director Andrew McCabe <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-worldwide-threats-hearing-0">told</a> [materials] the <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">Senate Intelligence Committee</a> [official website] Thursday that the FBI would continue to investigate alleged connections between the Trump administration and Russia despite the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">recent firing</a> [JURIST report] of former director James Comey. In response to a question from <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/">Senator Marco Rubio</a> [official website] about Russian ties, McCabe stated, "The work of the men and women of the F.B.I. continues despite any changes in circumstances. There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date. Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the F.B.I. from doing the right thing." He also swore to inform the Intelligence Committee if any attempt was made to interfere with investigations. McCabe was named acting director in the wake of James Comey's firing that occurred Tuesday evening and is now overseeing the investigation into the possibility of a collusion between the Trump administration and Russia during the 2016 US Presidential election. </p>

<p>The Trump administration has given conflicting reasons justifying Comey's firing. In an official letter of termination, President Trump said that Comey is "not able to effectively lead the Bueau" and that "It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission." The letter was  published in a <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711116/White-House-Fires-James-Comey.pdf">press release</a> [text, PDF] that included recommendations for Comey's ouster from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer pointed to Rosenstein as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/11/the-white-house-explanations-for-comeys-firing-are-crumbling-before-our-eyes/?utm_term=.bda48888428b">prime mover</a> [WP report] of the decision to fire Comey. In a memorandum, Rosenstein criticizes Comey's decision to close the investigation into Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server without prosecution, but he never specifically recommends firing Comey. White House deputy press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said on Wednesday that President Trump <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-10/white-house-clarifies-timeline-on-james-comey-dismissal">did not ask</a> [USNews report] for the recommendation but "The president had lost confidence in Director Comey, and frankly he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected." <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/">Democratic Senator of Calirofnia Dianne Feinstien</a> [official website] is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/live-briefing-james-comey-andrew-mccabe.html">skeptical of the memo</a> [NYT report], saying, "The memo appears to have been hastily assembled to justify a preordained outcome." Republican Senator Richard Burr also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/republican-response-comey-fired/">expressed concerns with the timing</a> [CNN report] of Comey's firing. Last week, federal prosecutors <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html">issued grand jury subpoenas</a> [CNN report] for the business records of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn who is being investigated for financial ties to Russia and Turkey. According to the CNN report, "The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia." The Senate Intelligence Committee has requested for Comey to testify as a private citizen in a closed hearing next week. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit </a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-5103.Opinion.5-5-2017.1.PDF">upheld </a> [opinion, PDF] the government bailout of <a href="http://www.aig.com/">American International Group (AIG)</a> [corporate website] as lawful.  The ruling came down in a denial of an appeal from <a href="http://www.starrcompanies.com/whoweare">Starr International Co</a> [corporate website] where shareholders were bringing suit against the government, arguing that the bailout was not only unconstitutional but harmful to the shareholders. Starr alleged the government's reverse stock split option was made to falsely increase the price of the shares and the high interest loan in exchange for equity was not permitted by the law. The court found that because AIG was not party to the suit and the methods saved the company from ruin, there was no claim. <blockquote>In sum, while we have no reason to doubt that Starr was affected by the Government&#8217;s acquisition of AIG equity, Starr has not established any ground for direct standing under either federal or Delaware law. The alleged injuries to Starr are merely incidental to injuries to AIG, and any remedy would go to AIG, not Starr. The Equity Claims are therefore exclusively derivative in nature and belong to AIG, which has exercised its business judgment and declined to prosecute this lawsuit. We need not reach the remaining issues on appeal with respect to the Equity Claims, including the question of whether the equity term was permissible under § 13(3) of the Act. </blockquote>AIG has been part of numerous lawsuits since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7748874.stm">2008 financial crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In February, former American International Group (AIG) CEO Maurice Greenberg <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/former-aig-executives-settle-fraud-charges-with-new-york-ag.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] accounting fraud charges, first brought by then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005. In June 2015, the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/former-aig-head-wins-bailout-suit-with-zero-damages.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Federal Reserve bailout of AIG  in 2008 exceeded its authority but did not award any damages. In March of the same year a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York  <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/aig-to-pay-nearly-1-billion-to-shareholders-in-class-action-settlement.php">approved </a>[JURIST report] a $970.5 million settlement between AIG and shareholders who said they were misled about the company's subprime mortgage exposure. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official site] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00125">rejected</a> [vote summary] a measure that would rollback methane gas regulations.  <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/36/text">HJ Res 36</a> [text] was a joint measure which sought to provide Congressional disapproval of the final rule of the Bureau of Land Management relating to "<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/18/2016-27637/waste-prevention-production-subject-to-royalties-and-resource-conservation">Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation</a>" [materials]. The rule controlled for the amount of methane that could be released during offshore drilling and when royalties were subjected during the process. The measure sought to overturn the ruling in order to support an increase in drilling. The House had passed the measure in February with 221-191 vote but in a 51-49 vote, the Senate rejected the measure to keep the protections in place. </p>

<p>Climate concerns continue to be an issue in local politics. Earthjustice, an environmental law advocacy group, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/environmental-groups-ask-appeals-court-to-order-epa-pesticide-ban.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] in April on behalf of two other environmental groups asking a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to order the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  to ban chlorpyrifos - a pesticide widely used for various fruits, vegetables, and wheat grown in the US. In March US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">signed </a>[Jurist report] an executive order reforming the previous administration's energy policies. In February the newly confirmed head of the EPA Scott Pruitt [<a href="/paperchase/2017/02/epa-chief-promises-aggressive-rollback-of-obama-regulations.php"> announced </a> [JURIST report] that they would be rolling back some Obama era regulations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kosovo's government lost a <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/?cid=1,128,8958">no confidence</a> [press release, in Albanian] on Wednesday. In a 78-34 <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kosovo-election-idUSKBN1871O1?il=0">vote</a> [Reuters report], the <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/?krye=home&lang=en">Kosovo Assembly</a> [official website] adopted a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Isa Mustafa's coalition government. Within hours of the vote, President Hashim Thaci dissolved the parliament. The outcome of the government's collapse will push an election, which was not due until next year, up to June 11, 2017. Opposition to Mustafa's administration blamed the cabinet for not following through with pledges made during their campaign three years ago. The cabinet was also unable to secure a parliamentary majority to pass a boarder demarcation deal with Montenegro. Opposition to the coalition claimed that Kosovo would lose territory under the agreement. Completing the deal is the final obstacle before the European Union will lift its requirement of needing a visa to travel to Kosovo. The election will delay both the deal and relations with Serbia that will further progress for both countries in gaining membership to the European Union. </p>

<p>Kosovo split from Serbia in 1999 following a campaign of ethnic cleansing directed against Albanians by Serbian forces. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 and has been attempting to establish itself as a country since. Last month the EU <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/eu-appoints-19-international-judges-to-special-court-in-kosovo.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] 19 International judges to the Specialist Chambers, effectively beginning the creation of the court. The court will serve a vital need, as suspected war criminals continue to be prosecuted in the region. In March the <a href="https://www.scp-ks.org/en">Kosovo Specialist Chambers</a> [official website] adopted <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/kosovo-special-court-adopts-rules-and-procedures.php">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [JURIST report] which allowed it to begin functioning. In January Kosovo <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/kosovo-indicts-ex-guerrilla-for-war-crimes.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] an ex-guerrilla for war crimes committed in connection with Serbian forces. Also in January a French Court of Appeals ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/france-appeals-court-releases-former-kosovo-pm-with-orders-to-remain-in-france.php">release of the ex-PM</a> [JURIST report] of Kosovo, with orders to stay in the country, until it reviewed an extradition order from Serbia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/">Vermont Legislature</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2018/S.22">voted to approve</a> [materials] recreational use of marijuana. The bill was <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/JOURNAL/hj170510.pdf#page=17">amended</a> [text] by the house to permit the recreational use of marijuana in small quantities. The law would create a legal system to regulate the use and sale of the drug, but would still make possession over an ounce a criminal offense.<blockquote> It is the intent of the General Assembly to eliminate all penalties for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana and two mature and four immature marijuana plants for a person who is 21 years of age or older while retaining criminal penalties for possession, dispensing and sale of larger amounts of marijuana. This act also retains civil penalties for possession of marijuana by a person under 21 years of age, which are the same as for possession of alcohol by a person under 21 years of age.</blockquote>The bill now awaits the Governor's signature. </p>

<p>Legalization measures are becoming a global priority. The Mexican Chamber of Deputies  <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/mexico-legislature-approves-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in April allowing the use, production and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. Also in April Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-legalizing-medicinal-marijuana-extract.php">signed Senate Bill 10</a> [JURIST report], legalizing the medicinal use of a marijuana extract, into law.  An anonymous Canadian government official in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/canada-may-legalize-recreational-marijuana-by-july-2018.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] the country's intention to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018. The lower house of the Dutch parliament in February <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dutch-lower-house-approves-bill-allowing-cultivation-of-cannabis.php">voted </a>[JURIST report] 77-72 to approve a bill [text, in Dutch] that would tolerate the cultivation of cannabis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/notification-senate-intel-committee-subpoenas-former-national-security-advisor-flynn-for-documents-regarding-russia-probe">issued a subpoena</a> [press release] Wednesday compelling former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to provide documents related to the committee's investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. In a joint statement from Chairman Senator Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Senator Mark Warner, the committee says that the documents being requested are the same documents they requested April 28. Flynn, through his attorney, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-nsc-advisor-michael-flynn-requests-immunity-in-exchange-for-testimony.php">refused to comply</a> [JURIST report] with that request without <a href="/paperchase/Statement%20of%20Counsel%20to%20Mike%20Flynn.pdf">immunity from prosecution</a> [letter, PDF]. </p>

<p>Allegations of Russian connections have been a problem for the Trump administration in the early stages of his presidency. Earlier this week former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-ag-yates-tells-senate-she-warned-of-flynn-vulnerability.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that she had warned about Flynn's vulnerabilities to blackmail by Russia less than a week after President Donald Trump assumed office.  In March, now-former FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the FBI is investigating allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election. Earlier the same month US Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recused himself</a> [JURIST report] from probes into Russian interference after it was revealed that he had <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">met with Russian officials</a> [JURIST reports] during the campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moon Jae-in was <a href="http://www.korea.net/Government/Briefing-Room/Presidential-Speeches/view?articleId=145935">sworn in as the 19th President of South Korea</a> [press release] on Wednesday, later that day seeking international assistance on North Korean weapons threats. Moon had a phone call with US President Donald Trump <a href="https://mn.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=3478441">focusing</a> [<em>KBS</em> report] on the threat of nuclear attack from North Korea. Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/10/readout-president-donald-j-trumps-call-president-moon-jae-republic-korea">invited Moon to the Washington</a> [press release] to discuss the issue "at an early date," an invitation that Moon accepted. Moon also took calls from <a href="http://www.korea.net/Government/Current-Affairs/National-Affairs/view?affairId=534&subId=594&articleId=24497">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> and <a href="http://www.korea.net/Government/Current-Affairs/National-Affairs/view?affairId=534&subId=593&articleId=145971">Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> [press releases], with an official statement from the president's office stressing that North Korea's weapons program is a primary concern for all three countries. "Denuclearization in Pyongyang [North Korea], and also across the peninsula, is our common goal," according to the statement. </p>

<p>President Moon inherits a difficult and long-standing challenge in dealing with the reclusive communist country's nuclear ambitions. In February, Prime Minister Abe and President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/10/remarks-president-trump-and-prime-minister-abe-japan-joint-press">strongly condemned</a> [text] a North Korea ballistic missile test during a joint conference from Palm Beach, Florida. Kim Jong-un, leader of North Korea, <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/north-korea-declares-it-will-test-intercontinental-ballistic-missile.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in his New Year's address that the country is in the final stage of preparations to test-launch an intercontinental ballistic rocket. At the start of 2016, the US Congress approved <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-house-approves-bill-to-sanction-north-korea-following-nuclear-test.php">additional sanctions</a> [JURIST report] including the seizure of assets and limitation of commerce in response to reports that North Korea tested a hydrogen bomb [NYT report]. In April of 2016, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53698#.WKDl2W8rLIV">"strongly condemn[ed]"</a> [press release] North Korea's testing of missiles and that February, UN Secretary General described North Korea's missile launching as <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-sg-condemns-north-korea-missile-launch.php">"deplorable"</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Trump signed an <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/executiveorders/13799.php">executive order</a> [text, JURIST] on Thursday launching a commission to investigate allegations of voter fraud and suppression. Vice President Mike Pence will head the Presidential Commission on Election Integrity along with <a href="https://www.kansansforkobach.com/">Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach </a> [official website], a voter identification advocate with a tough stance on immigration. The panel will consist of about a dozen election officials from both parties and will be tasked with finding vulnerabilities in the system such as fraudulent voter registration. During his campaign, President Trump repeatedly made <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/11/donald-trump-voter-fraud-investigation/">unfounded claims</a> [Fortune report] of voter fraud, insisting the election was "rigged" against him. After the election, he maintained that voter fraud had taken place by asserting to congressional leaders that had there not been "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/at-white-house-trump-tells-congressional-leaders-3-5-million-illegal-ballots-cost-him-the-popular-vote/?tid=a_inl&utm_term=.df5b9b278c8c">millions of illegal votes</a>" [WP report] he would have won the popular vote against Hilary Clinton. The White House has yet to provide documentation backing up President Trump's claims.</p>

<p>Several states have enacted statutes to address voter fraud, often by setting a stricter requirement for what type of ID is necessary to be allowed to vote. Some have <a href="/forum/2016/10/michael-gilbert-election-integrity.php">argued</a> [JURIST commentary] however, that having stricter voter ID laws will not improve the integrity of elections. In April US District Judge Nelva G. Ramos <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rules-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that a controversial Texas voter ID law was passed in part with discriminatory intent. In February Texas officials <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/texas-election-officials-hundreds-of-texans-may-have-voted-improperly.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of people were allowed to improperly cast ballots in the recent presidential election, evading the state's stringent voter ID law, by signing affidavits in lieu of showing their photo ID. Also in February Democratic <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission </a>(FEC) [official website] member <a href="http://www.fec.gov/members/weintraub/weintraub.shtml">Ellen Weintraub</a> [official profile] in a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/fec-commissioner-ask-to-trump-to-prove-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-allegation.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] urged President Donald Trump to present evidence of his claims of extensive voter fraud in New Hampshire. In January the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear an appeal by Texas seeking to revive the state's voter identification requirements. In April 2016 the Arizona Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/arizona-judge-dismisses-voter-fraud-complaint.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit alleging voter fraud during the 2016 primaries. In January the US Supreme Court r<a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">efused to hear</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit about a Texas voter ID law, that would limit IDs that could be used to vote to seven specified government issued IDs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice (ECJ) </a> [official website] on Thursday<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=190593&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=892063"> issued a non-binding opinion</a> [text] finding that <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber </a> [corporate website] is a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. Uber presented itself as technology services that uses infrastructure to provide transportation. But a Spanish taxi union argued the description gave Uber an unfair tactical advantage because the company was not subject to the same rules and regulations as other transportation companies. The court found because Uber controlled every aspect of the encounter, it was a transportation company and subject to the all local rules and regulations of the jurisdictions they enter. It did uphold Uber's right to have independent contractors instead of employees and refused to order an injunction on the app.   <blockquote>Uber&#8217;s activity must be viewed as a whole encompassing both the service of connecting passengers and drivers with one another by means of the smartphone application and the supply of transport itself, which constitutes, from an economic perspective, the main component. This activity cannot therefore be split into two, for the purpose of classifying a part of the service as an information society service. Consequently, the service must be classified as a &#8216;service in the field of transport'</blockquote> The court refused to rule on the use of technology in the Uber scheme and remanded the case for a lower court to decide if any penalties are necessary. </p>

<p>Since its inception, Uber has mounted legal challenges based on its business model.  Last Thursday it became public that the the Department of Justice (DOJ) has <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/reuters-doj-conducting-criminal-investigation-of-uber-for-avoiding-law-enforcement.php">launched a criminal</a> [JURIST report] investigation into the company  for the use of a software tool that helped drivers evade local transport regulators.  The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/uber-ordered-to-pay-20-million-for-misleading-recruitment-information.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] in January  that Uber Technologies [corporate website] agreed to pay $20 million to settle a claim that the ride-hailing company had engaged in misleading tactics to recruit new drivers. The European wing of Uber <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/uber-indicted-in-denmark-for-violating-taxi-laws.php">was indicted</a> [JURIST report] in Denmark last December  on charges of assisting drivers in their violation of taxi laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump signed an <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/executiveorders/13800.php">executive order</a> [text, JURIST] Thursday designed to strengthen IT and cyber security frameworks in the country by having agency heads manage security risks and modernize the IT infrastructure. The order also mandates the use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework to manage risks and a creation of a new cyber secure network. The order calls on all agency head to submit a risk assessment within 90 days which will outline the goals and vulnerabilities within each agency.  <blockquote>Known but unmitigated vulnerabilities are among the highest cybersecurity risks faced by executive departments and agencies (agencies).  Known vulnerabilities include using operating systems or hardware beyond the vendor's support lifecycle, declining to implement a vendor's security patch, or failing to execute security-specific configuration guidance. Effective risk management requires agency heads to lead integrated teams of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisition, law, privacy, and human resources.</blockquote> The order mandates a report on security that will be released at the end of the year. </p>

<p>Cyber security is a growing threat around the world. The National Control Commission for the Election Campaign for the Presidential Election (CNCCEP) on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/commission-warns-journalist-may-face-prosecution-if-publish-hacking-info.php">cautioned </a>[JURIST report] media outlets against sharing information leaked from an alleged hack of a presidential candidate. in April Roman Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russian-man-receives-longest-ever-cybercrime-sentence.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for hacking into more than 500 US businesses, stealing then selling millions of credit card numbers.  Also in April the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/doj-disables-kelihos-botnet-after-arrest-of-russia-hacker.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that it had effectively disrupted the Kelihos botnet, a network of thousands of virus ridden computers used to glean personal information and login credentials by distributing malicious software through spam email. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The North Korean legislature on Friday sent a <a href="https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/274659/u-s-state-sponsored-terrorism-will-be-recorded-as-unprecedented-setback-kcna-memorandum/">letter</a> [text, KCNAWatch] to the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] protesting new <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/legislation/h-r-1644-korean-interdiction-modernization-sanctions-act/">sanctions</a> [materials] raised against the country. The letter is a rare communication between the two nations, who do not have any formal ways to communicate. The letter <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/international/333076-north-korea-warns-us-lawmakers-against-tightening-sanctions">stated</a> [Hill report], "As the U.S. House of Representatives enacts more and more of these reckless hostile laws, the DPRK's efforts to strengthen nuclear deterrents will gather greater pace, beyond anyone's imagination."  Condemnation of sanctions and US actions is not uncommon by North Korea, yet this formal approach is not common. In 1984 North Korea also sent a letter to congress, which led to talks between the US, South and North Korea. Some <a href="http://time.com/4776890/north-korea-sanctions-letter-congress/">believe</a> [TIME report] that this communication, which came from a recently revived commission may be a move to create possible dialogue between the isolated nation and the greater international community.  </p>

<p>Tensions continue to rise throughout the international community in regards to the North Korean actions seeking to obtain functional nuclear missile. In January <a href="https://www.jurist.org/wayback/world/northkorea.htm">North Korea</a> [JURIST background] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/north-korea-declares-it-will-test-intercontinental-ballistic-missile.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would attempt intercontinental ballistic missile test, furthering its effort to show strength to the world. It has been well documented throughout the world that these tests will be denounced by many prominent nations. With some mulling the idea of possible military intervention on the Korean peninsula, the more common rhetoric has been that increased sanctions on the country will force it to comply with the international communities wishes. That is what the United States did in January, when it choose to <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-expands-sanctions-on-north-korea-for-human-rights-violations.php">increase sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on North Korea in regards to the countries violations of human rights.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former congresswoman Corrine Brown was convicted of fraud on Thursday. Brown represented the Jacksonville, Florida district from 1993 to 2017 as part of the Democratic party. She had lost re-election last fall after her indictment. Brown was convicted of 18 out of 22 charges related to the misuse of funds from the charity One Door for Education. The charity was meant to provide scholarships, but the court <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2017-05-11/ex-us-rep-corrine-brown-guilty-18-fraud-tax-charges">found</a> [<em>Florida Times-Union</em> report] it had only given out one $1,200 scholarship to an unidentified person, despite bringing in $800,000 between 2012 and 2016. The rest was spent on lavish parties, trips, and shopping excursions. Brown's former chief of staff, Elias "Ronnie" Simmons, and the charity's president, Carla Wiley, both previously pleaded guilty to misusing the charity's funds and testified against Brown. Sentencing is expected to take place in about 90 days. Brown, who is currently 70, could potentially spend the rest of her life in prison. Brown still maintains her innocence, blaming the theft solely on Simmons.</p>

<p>Brown was convicted of 12 counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, three counts of filing a false US individual tax return, one count of engaging in a scheme to conceal material facts, and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the Internal Revenue Laws. The conviction comes less than a year after a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-dismiss-corruption-charges-against-sen-bob-menendez.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss corruption charges against US Democratic Senator Bob Menendez. Menendez is expected to face <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/doctor-tied-to-new-jersey-democratic-sen-bob-menendez-convicted-of-medicare-fraud/article/2621622">trial</a> [<em>Washington Examiner</em> report] this fall on those charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] on Friday issued a <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/jeff-sessionss-criminal-charging-policy/2432/">new charging policy </a> [materials] urging prosecutors to seek the largest sentences for each crime. This reverses the past administrations policy regarding drug related crimes. The so-called <a href="https://www.fd.org/sites/default/files/criminal_defense_topics/essential_topics/sentencing_resources/clemency/holdermemo.pdf">Holder Memo</a> [text, PDF] had been issued to urge that prosecutors to not seek the longer sentences for people charged with drug crimes that were not connected to large drug organizations. The new Sessions memo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-issues-sweeping-new-criminal-charging-policy/2017/05/11/4752bd42-3697-11e7-b373-418f6849a004_story.html?utm_term=.b716bed737a4">urges</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] prosecutors to "charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense". This new policy is expected to lead to more federal prosecutions and raise the prison population. This is the first move by the Trump administration to tighten its criminal justice in regards to the drugs in the country. </p>

<p>Combating drug use is an issue US President Donald Trump has emphasized in recent months. In March he signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/30/presidential-executive-order-establishing-presidents-commission">executive order</a> [materials] which <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">established a task force</a> [JURIST report] which is charged with reducing drug addiction in the nation. This order comes as the national opioid epidemic sweeps throughout America, leaving more people than ever addicted to the substance. President Trump in February also <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-new-executive-orders-targeting-drugs-and-crime-reduction.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order that was aimed at targeting drug cartels in an attempt to reduce crimes against law enforcement.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court of Northern California</a> [official website] gave final approval on Thursday for <a href="http://www-origin.vw.com/">Volkswagen's</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/vwmdl/proposed-settlement-3-liter">settlement</a> [text] related to cheating on the emissions of their 3.0-liter vehicles sold in the US.  The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-idUSKBN1871WO">settlement</a> [Reuters report] requires Volkswagen to pay at least $1.22 billion to buy back or fix 80,000 3.0-liter vehicles. Owners of the vehicles will receive between $7,000 and $16,000 from Volkswagen to fix the cars if the emissions remedies are approved. If regulators do not approve the fixes, Volkswagen could end up paying up to $4.04 billion. The amount of compensation the owners receive will be based on the year and model of their car. In total, Volkswagen must pay up to $25 billion related to the vehicles sold in the US. The final settlement related to the 2.0-liter vehicles was <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/crb/vwmdl/final-settlement-2-Liter">approved</a> [settlement] in late April.</p>

<p>The Volkswagen scandal began in September 2015 when it was leaked that Volkswagen had intentionally circumvented emissions tests through installing technology to determine when emissions testing would take place and alter the cars emissions during inspections. The company has since undergone litigation in a number of countries throughout the world. In April, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/german-court-allows-use-of-seized-evidence-against-volkswagen.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the seizure of evidence against Volkswagen obtained during a raid of the law firm Jones Day. In December, South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-to-file-criminal-action-against-volkswagen.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to fine the company for false advertising. In October, a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/spain-court-orders-vw-to-pay-car-owner-over-emisions-scandal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Volkswagen to pay a car owner €5,006 for the 10% decrease in the car's value due to the emissions cheating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/05/270816.htm">signed</a> [press release] the <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/other/2017/270802.htm">Fairbanks Declaration</a> [text] to affirm protection of the arctic climate. The move was a part of the <a href="http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/">10th Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting</a> [official website], with goals to maintain peace, stability and constructive cooperation in the Arctic. The signing of the declaration included reaffirming the threat of climate change and a promise to work together to solve issues facing the Arctic region.<blockquote>Note again that the Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, note with concern that the pace and scale of continuing Arctic warming will depend on future emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants, reiterate the importance of global action to reduce both greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants to mitigate climate change, and call for the Arctic Council to undertake additional analyses to contribute to the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and continued collaboration with all levels of governments</blockquote>The measure is not binding on the US or any partner. </p>

<p>Climate concerns and solutions are still a contested issue. The US Senate on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-votes-to-keep-methane-regulations.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a measure that would rollback methane gas regulations. The Trump administration in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-administration-requests-delay-of-appeals-court-ruling-on-clean-power-plan.php">asked </a>[JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  to postpone ruling on the Obama administration's climate change regulations. Also in March, US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order reforming the previous administration's energy policies.  UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-calls-for-strong-anti-pollution-legislation-and-enforcement.php">called </a>[JURIST report] on global leaders in February to take urgent action on air pollution to ensure world citizens enjoy what the UN calls "the human rights to life and health in environments free from contamination."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President of Congo's Commission <a href="http://www.ceni.cd/">Electorale Nationale Indépendante  (CENI)</a> [advocacy website, in French] , <a href="http://www.ceni.cd/portraits/corneille-nangaa-yobeluo">Corneille Nangaa </a> [official website, in French] on Friday warned the presidential election may be postponed due to sectarian violence. Nangaa make the remarks <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-politics-idUSKBN1882EA">during an interview with Reuters</a> [report]. He expressed concern about the violence in the region and the militia's interference with the election process. Nangaa and CENI remain <a href="http://www.ceni.cd/articles/le-president-corneille-nangaa-et-une-delegation-de-loif-en-mission-de-supervision-et-dobservation-dans-le-kongo-central">committed </a> [press release, in French] to ensuring the election takes places by the end of the year. Of concern to Nangaa is the issue of fighting in the region of Kasai, Kasai Central and Lomami. In a previous statement Nangaa <a href="https://actualite.cd/2017/05/10/lubaya-nangaa-a-dit-quil-impossible-dorganiser-elections-kasai/">expressed</a>[Acuatlite report, in French]  the following, <blockquote>It is now up to the government to use all means in its power to pacify the provinces of Kasai, Kasai Central and Lomami, favoring peaceful means of conflict resolution and ending the militarization of an oasis of peace. Opinion leaders, for their part, are committed to raising awareness among all sections of the population of Kasai to create a climate of peace and tranquility conducive to electoral operations and to participate massively in them. </blockquote>Violence in the Congo has plagued the nations for years. Spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency, Babar Baloch, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-more-drc-refugees-migrating-to-angola-to-escape-violence.php">said</a> [JURIST report]  in a press release in April  that over 11,000 refugees from the Kasai province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have recently escaped to Angola due to violence in their province.  The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/icc-violence-in-drc-could-be-war-crimes.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] also in April alleging that recent acts of violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could amount to war crimes. In March, Secretary-General António Guterres  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-human-rights-investigators-killed-in-the-drc.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the remains of two human rights investigators were found in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-fe11-d361-abff-ffdb15370001">ordered</a> [text, PDF]  the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive ored. Arab American Civil Rights League v. Trump, is a case before the court arguing that the immigration ban initially proposed by the administration had discriminatory intent against Muslims. The previous draft in question was alleged to have been made by an adviser of Trump who said the administration asked him to find a way to make a muslim ban legal. The court held the draft had enough significance to warrant limited discovery as the parties involved had standing to proceed with the case. <blockquote>Moreover, in light of the other findings - especially the finding that the motion to dismiss will not dispose of the case entirely - Defendants' concern that the discovery sought will implicate several complex privilege issues, including a matter of first impression pertaining to information related to a president elect's activities, weighs in favor of allowing Plaintiffs to initiate limited discovery immediately. Because these issues will inevitably be raised, there is no point in delaying discovery and delaying the progress of this case, just to avoid having to decide these issues now</blockquote><br />
The deadline for disclosure of the draft is the May 19.</p>

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/appeals-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-revised-travel-ban-appeal.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on Monday regarding President Donald Trump's immigration executive order. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill banning so-called "sanctuary cities" in the state. The US Supreme Court  <a href="http://jurist.or/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-asylum-appeal.php">declined to hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a group of Central American asylum-seekers in April who hoped the court would overturn a lower court's ruling preventing them from having their removal orders reviewed by a federal judge. The US Department of Justice  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/justice-department-appeals-court-injunction-on-travel-ban.php">filed a notice </a>[JURIST report] in March saying that it will appeal a Hawaii federal judge's order against President Donald Trump's  revised travel ban. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The OCHA <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/who-we-are">came into being</a> [OCHA backgrounder] in 1991, when the General Assembly adopted <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/582/70/IMG/NR058270.pdf?OpenElement">resolution 46/182</a> [text, PDF] to to strengthen the UN's response to emergencies and natural disasters and to improve the overall effectiveness of humanitarian operations. The USG/ERC is <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/ocha-leadership">responsible</a> [materials] for the "oversight of all emergencies requiring United Nations humanitarian assistance." The USG also serves as the "central focal point for governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental relief activities." The current OCHA USG Stephen O'Brien's term has been to the end of August 2017, so as to enable him to conclude a number of initiatives and reforms he has been leading at OCHA, without any impediments. O'Brien, himself from the UK, was <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1553.doc.htm">appointed over two years ago</a> [press release] by then UN SG <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/formersg/ban.shtml">Ban Ki-moon</a> [UN profile]. O'Brien brought to the position extensive experience in international humanitarian affairs, and was noted for his contributions to the fight against malaria and neglected tropical diseases, and to UK's achievement of the UN-endorsed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance. At the OCHA, among other things, O'Brien has been at the forefront of the crisis in Syria, attempting to gather support to evacuate civilians from conflict-ridden areas in Syria. Last month O 'Brien <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-official-condemns-attack-on-civilian-evacuees-in-syria.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] attacks against people, including many civilians, who were fleeing the Syrian towns of Foah and Kefraya. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Tunisians on Saturday <a href="http://front-populaire.org/?p=5068">protested</a> [advocacy press release] a bill that would grant amnesty to officials facing corruption charges from a previous regime. Under the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/14/tunisia-amnesty-bill-would-set-back-transition">amnesty bill</a> [HRW backgrounder] officials who had money seized from them following the overthrow of former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12196679">Ben Ali </a> [BBC profile] would be pardoned and have their funds returned to them. Proponents of the bill say it would help reconcile political divisions in the country but it has been met with <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2016/5/31/we-shall-not-forgive-tunisias-campaign-against-ex-regime-figures"> massive public disapproval</a> [Al-Araby report].  </p>

<p>Tunisia continues to face challenges after the Arab Spring uprising. A Tunisian court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/tunisia-court-sentences-uk-dj-to-prison-for-offending-public-morality.php">sentenced</a> British DJ Dax Jto a year in prison in April for public indecency and offending public morality after the artist played  a remix of the Muslim call to prayer in a nightclub.  In March, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/germany-and-italy-deport-suspected-terrorists-to-tunisia.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report]  that a Tunisian man responsible for a deadly museum attack in Tunisia in 2015 will be deported. Tunisian security forces have committed human rights abuses following a series of armed attacks in the country, Amnesty International (AI)  <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-tunisia-security-forces-committing-rights-abuses.php">reported</a> [JURIST report ] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egypt's State Council General Assembly on Saturday nominated their own council head despite a recent <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-president-signs-law-giving-him-authority-to-appoint-head-judges.php">amendment</a> [JURIST report]  reserving that right for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi . The <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2017/05/13/state-council-defies-amendments-judicial-authority-law/"> nomination</a> [Daily News Egypt report] follows a contentious debate over amending the judiciary laws to give the president more control over the judiciary to fight terrorism. The council nominated Judge Yehia Dakroury to be their council head. The new law gives the president the power to nominate the council head which means he<a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/egypt-s-judges-put-sisi-political-judicial-deadlock"> may ignore the nomination</a> [Egyptian Independent report].</p>

<p>Egypt's attempt to provide security through increasingly strict laws has been the focus of recent scrutiny. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-egypt-security-measures-encouraging-radicalization.php">said </a> [JURIST report] last week that Egypt's recent security measures have been encouraging the very radicalization they were trying to control. In April, JURIST Guest Columnist Mohamed Abdelaal  <a href="/forum/2017/04/Mohamed-Abdelaal-rule-of-law-in-egypt.php">discussed</a> [JURIST report] how the revival of the Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 had potential to negatively impact the rule of law in Egypt. Also in April an Egyptian criminal court in Cairo <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-court-jails-former-official-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Habib el-Adly, the former interior minister under former president Hosni Mubarak, to seven years in jail for embezzling more than $100m of public funds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/051517zor_986b.pdf">declined to hear</a> [order list, PDF] a lower court's rejection of a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v8.pdf"> North Carolina Voter ID law</a> [text, PDF]. The piece of legislation, which was originally enacted in 2013 has faced numerous legal challenges over the past years, including the Supreme Court previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">declining to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] the law before the 2016 election. The North Carolina General Assembly urged the Supreme Court to review the lower court decision, which had <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/supreme-court-north-carolina-voter-id/">stated</a> [CNN report] that the bill significantly disenfranchised minorities.</p>

<p>Voter ID laws have been a trend by many States within the recent years, which has led to a series of contested court cases. These laws are often thought to be discriminatory in nature, which has led to backlash in a variety of ways. In February rights groups announced a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/rights-organization-announces-boycut-of-north-carolina-over-discriminatory-legislation.php">boycott</a> [JURIST report] in North Carolina over the state's voter ID law. February in Arkansas, the legislature decided that it would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/arkansas-house-approves-plan-to-reinstate-voter-id-laws.php">reinstate</a> [JURIST report] a voter id law which had been struck down by the courts two years prior. The Supreme Court in January also <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear an appeal on a Texas law regarding voter id laws. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/web/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website] on Monday upheld the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/resources/documents/617564_CRIMINAL_APPEAL_NO.39-40_OF_2013_2.pdf">conviction</a> [text, PDF] of Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, an Islamist preacher sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16207201">1971 liberation war</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the country. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/web/?page=chief_justice.php&menu=11">Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha</a> [official profile] delivered the judgment of the court, <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/node/1100131/world">rejecting pleas</a> [AFP report] from both sides to change the verdict. The state was seeking a death sentence while the defense was looking for an acquittal. Sayeedi was charged for a variety of crimes in connection to his role supporting the Pakistani army during the war, ranging from kidnapping and rape to forced religious conversion. </p>

<p>The International Crimes Tribunal, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with detaining, prosecuting and punishing persons responsible for committing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under international law committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." Last year the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-high-court-upholds-islamist-leaders-death-sentence.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for Islamist leader Motiur Rahman Nizami. Earlier last year the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence of a former opposition politician for allegedly committing war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. In February of last year the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-2-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two men to death for crimes against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court issued an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-32_o7jp.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kindred-nursing-centers-limited-partnership-v-clark/">Kindred Nursing Centers Limited Partnership v. Clark</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] on Monday holding that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/chapter-1">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [LII materials] preempts a Kentucky state law that requires a power-of-attorney agreements to expressly grant authority to enter an arbitration agreement. The Kentucky Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-binding-arbitration-agreements.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that arbitration agreements signed by legal representatives of nursing home residents were invalid, unless the ability to so sign is specified as a power of the representative, as being against the right to have a jury trial. The Supreme Court, however, found that the FAA "preempts any state rule discriminating on its face against arbitration" and that "hostility to arbitration" is what "led Congress to enact the FAA." Justice Thomas dissented stating that the FAA does not apply to proceedings in state courts and "does not displace a rule that requires express authorization from a principal before an agent may waive the principal's right to a jury trial." </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has decided multiple cases in favor of arbitration agreements and the FAA in the recent past. In <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-upholds-binding-arbitration-clause-in-directv-case.php">DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia</a> [JURIST report], the court held 6-3 that the FAA preempts a California court's refusal to enforce an arbitration clause in a contract. In <a href="/hotline/2012/12/rochelle-bobroff-ussc-faa.php">Nitro-Lift Technologies v. Howard</a> [JURIST op-ed], the court unanimously concluded that the FAA preempted an Oklahoma state court from determining whether an employment contract violated an Oklahoma law that limited the enforceability of non-competition agreements. Holding that only an arbitrator could determine whether the contract violated state law, the Supreme Court simply cited its prior precedent, which purported to rely on congressional intent in passing the FAA in 1925. In <a href="/dateline/2013/02/robert-marcelis-arbitration-agreement.php">Marmet Health Care v. Brown</a> [JURIST op-ed], the court repudiated West Virginia's categorical bar invalidating arbitration agreements that involve personal injury or wrongful death in nursing homes.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> [official website] issued an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1031_hejm.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] on Monday for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/howell-v-howell/">Howell v. Howell</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] ruling that a veteran does not need to pay a divorced spouse for retirement benefits that have been waived in favor of service-related disability benefits. In <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/490/581.html">Mansell v. Mansell</a> [text] the court held that while the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31663.pdf">Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act</a> (USFSPA) [CRS backgrounder, PDF] allows for a state to treat a veteran's "disposable retired pay" as divisible property, the act expressly excludes "from its definition of 'disposable retired pay' amounts deducted from that pay 'as a result of a waiver . . . required by law in order to receive' disability benefits." The court also stated that "reimbursement or indemnification displace the federal rule" and as a result are also preempted by USFSPA. </p>

<p>When John and Sandra Howell divorced in 1991 the <a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/AZ-Courts/Superior-Court">Arizona Superior Court</a> [official website] in anticipation of John's retirement granted Sandra half of his Military Retirement Plan funds, treating them like community property. In 2005 the Department of Veteran's Affairs found that John was about 20% disabled due to a service-related injury to his shoulder. In order to receive disability benefits, he was required to waive some of his retirement funds in order to prevent double counting. In doing so, Sandra's portion of retirement pay was reduced by about $250 per month. The Arizona family court enforced the original decree holding that it had given Sandra a "vested interest in the prewaiver amount of that pay." The Supreme Court held that although the waiver in Mansell took place before the divorce proceeding, unlike the waiver in Howell that came many years after the divorce, the state court still did not have the power to extinguish the future contingency that Sandra's share of military retirement pay would be worth less due to John's waiver.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] Council on Monday <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/venezuela/26136/consejo-de-la-uni%C3%B3n-europea-adopta-conclusiones-sobre-venezuela-150517_en">urged</a> [official statement] Venezuelan officials to release political prisoners and hold elections in hopes of ending the violent protests against <a href="http://www.nicolasmaduro.org.ve/biografia/#.WPjdSVPyuLJ">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official profile, in Spanish]. The EU called for peace saying that:<br />
<blockquote>Violence and the use of force will not solve the country's crisis. The fundamental rights of the Venezuelan people, including the right to demonstrate peacefully, must be respected. It is essential that all parties refrain from violent acts. In this context, the announcement of the extension and reinforcement of armed civil groups is disturbing, as it can fuel a resurgence of violence and contribute to no solution.</blockquote> EU officials said they hope that Venezuelan authorities can work constructively toward a solution to the country's crisis that not only affects Venezuelans, but also more than 600,000 Europeans whose security is a concern for the EU. The council also said it is willing to cooperate with Venezuelan authorities to assist with security and to protect all European citizens in Venezuela during these protests that have injured hundreds and killed at least 39 people since they <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-eu-idUSKCN18B1LF">began</a> [Reuters report].</p>

<p>Venezuela has had significant political unrest since the December 2015 election. In October of 2016, the National Assembly voted to open criminal <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-348_h315.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that a creditor may seek repayment of a debt even after the statute of limitations period has expired without facing sanctions. The court, in a 5-3 decision, ruled in favor of <a href="https://www.midlandfunding.com/">Midland Funding</a> [official website], a credit management corporation, which was being sued by Aleida Johnson, a resident of Alabama. In 2014 Johnson filed for bankruptcy under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/chapter-13">Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code</a> [LII materials]. Two months later Midland filed a written statement asserting that Johnson owed Midland credit card debit of $1,879.71. The last activity on the card was more than 10 years before Johnson filed for bankruptcy and well outside of Alabama's six-year statute of limitations, so Johnson sued Midland <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-deportation-standards.php">arguing</a> [JURIST report] that it violated a late protecting against unfair debt collection practices. Justice Breyer, delivering the opinion of the court, said that the written statement did not fall within the scope of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> [text] because it was "not 'false, deceptive, or misleading representation,' or using any 'unfair or unconscionable means' to collect, or attempt to collect, a debt." </p>

<p>Justice Sotomayor dissented and was joined by Justices Ginsberg and Kagan. In her dissent Sotomayor writes, "Professional debt collectors have built a business out of buying stale debt, filing claims in bankruptcy proceedings to collect it, and hoping that no one notices that the debt is too old to be enforced by the courts. This practice is both 'unfair' and 'unconscionable.'" She goes on to point out that statutes of limitations do not deter debt buyers. Because statutes of limitations are affirmative defenses, "consumers must appear in court and raise it in order to dismiss the suit." Consumers, though, often fail to appear in court and as a result debt buyers "have won 'billions of dollars in default judgments' simply by filing suit and betting that consumers will lack the resources to respond." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_video.php?pk_vid=0000011467">heard</a> [video; <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">materials</a>] arguments Monday on the Trump administration's revised ban on travelers from some majority Muslim countries. <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">State of Hawaii, et al. v. Trump</a> [materials] was brought before the court on appeal after the travel ban <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">was previously struck down</a> [JURIST report]. At issue is the alleged  <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2017/02/Marjorie-Cohn-trump-unconstitutional-muslim-ban.php">discriminatory intent </a> [JURIST op-ed] of the executive order that was designed to prevent individuals from specified countries from coming into the country. Due to statements made during the campaign, the plaintiffs allege the travel ban was in fact a Muslim ban and therefore unconstitutional. However, the administration argued the comments were campaign rhetoric that has no basis on an executive order that is facially neutral in wording. The administration also argued the ban is targeted at countries where terrorist organizations have safe havens, even though the previous statements about Muslims were not explicitly disavowed. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">travel ban</a> [text] continues to create mounting legal issues. The US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan last week <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the order. Also last week the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/appeals-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-revised-travel-ban-appeal.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/348409551/Waymo-Uber-Injunction">ordered</a> [opinion] <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber </a> [corporate website] engineer removed from the self-driving division of the company in a ruling made public Monday. The case <a href="https://www.law360.com/cases/58af6ff8a1717c55ec000001">Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies Inc.</a> [materials, law360]  centers on engineer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/23/anthony-levandowski-google-uber-self-driving-cars-lawsuit">Anthony Levandowski</a> [Guardian report] who may have stolen information from self-driving technology company <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo </a> [corporate website] before becoming employed at Uber. The two transportation companies are in a race to bring self-driving capabilities using <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/l-is-for-lidar/">Lidar technology</a> [Scientific American backgrounder] to the market. The court ordered the engineer to not work for the driving program and be relocated elsewhere in the company.<blockquote> By way of summary, this order finds plaintiff Waymo LLC has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there. The evidence shows that, both before and after his departure, Levandowski and defendant Uber Technologies,Inc., planned for Uber to acquire Levandowski's new companies, defendants Ottomotto LLC and Otto Trucking LLC, and to hire Levandowski as the head of its self-driving car efforts. Moreover, defendants and Levandowski anticipated and took steps to defend against litigation with Waymo in connection with his move to Uber.</blockquote> The court also ordered all communication between Levadowski and Uber  as well as compliance communications to be turned over in discovery by May 31st. </p>

<p>Uber continues to have legal battles over its technology and organization. Last week the European Court of Justice (ECJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a non-binding opinion finding that Uber is a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. Earlier this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/reuters-doj-conducting-criminal-investigation-of-uber-for-avoiding-law-enforcement.php">announced it has launched</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation into Uber for the use of a software tool that helped drivers evade local transport regulators. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/uber-ordered-to-pay-20-million-for-misleading-recruitment-information.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in January that Uber Technologies agreed to pay $20 million to settle a claim that the ride-hailing company had engaged in misleading tactics to recruit new drivers</p>]]></content:encoded>

The election, which is scheduled for Friday, is among current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22886729">President Hassan Rouhani</a> [BBC profile] and a handful of challengers. Rouhani is favored to win the election after he was able to negotiate a deal over the nuclear sanctions. The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-4510870/Over-60-electoral-violations-run-Iran-vote-judiciary.html">infractions</a> [DailyMail report] leading up to the elections were committed by "governors, county chiefs, district chiefs and the heads of government offices" as reported by Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei. The two arrests were in connection with an attempt to steal rival campaign documents. The government has not released information about any of the other violations, only saying that they are being pursued by the courts. The tensions building in the nation are between the moderate and hardline political factions. </p>

<p>The main political challenger Ebrahim Raisi, who was a former member of the often criticized hardline judiciary, has been criticized for executions of jailed dissidents during his time as prosecutor in the 1980's. The choice the nation is faced is with the more conservative Raisi who might follow the hardline policy that many of the courts follow. In April the Supreme Court of Iran <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/iran-supreme-court-upholds-five-year-prison-sentence-for-woman-on-undisclosed-charges.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction and five-year prison sentence of a British-Iranian woman, but did not disclose the crime she is accused of committing. Conditions in the Iranian prison system has led to the US Department of the Treasury to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/us-treasury-sanctions-iran-prison-company.php">implement sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against the Iranian prison company Tehran Prisons Organization and one of its senior officials over conditions and treatment of prisoners, many of which are political opponents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ukrainian Security and Defense Council <a href="http://www.rnbo.gov.ua/en/news/2764.html">imposed</a> [materials] sanctions on a series of Russian tech companies Tuesday, citing security concerns over possible cyber attacks. The council said that the sanctions were imposed to protect against companies "whose activities threaten the information and cyber security of Ukraine". The sanctions <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-sanctions-idUSKCN18C0SQ">froze any assets</a> [Reuters report]  held by the Russian companies still in Ukraine as of Tuesday morning. These new sanctions have increased to 400 the total number of blacklisted Russian firms in Ukraine since 2014. The action will have an effect on <a href="https://vk.com/">Vkontakte</a> [corporate website], which is the Russian version of Facebook, and is widely popular in the country.</p>

<p>Russia has been subject to a variety of economic sanctions from many different nations over recent years. In March the European Court of Justice ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php">sanctions </a> [JURIST report] placed on Russia by the European Union were valid. These sanctions were targeting Russia's involvement in Ukraine, in an attempt to slow the Russian involvement on the border crisis between the two countries. Also in March Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/ukraine-asks-icj-to-bar-russia-from-aiding-ukraine-separatists.php">asked the International Courtof Justice</a> [JURIST report] to bar any Russian action in supporting separatists. In January the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-senate-bill-seeks-mandatory-sanctions-against-russia-for-hacking.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at implementing sanctions against Russia for its involvement in hacking during the 2016 presidential election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Africa's <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">highest court</a> [official website] heard arguments on Monday from <a href="https://www.enca.com/south-africa/sacp-remain-resolute-in-call-for-zuma-to-step-down">opposition parties</a> [press release] who demanded that the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3549876/UDM-Founding-Affidavit-Very-FINAL-COMPLETE-10-04.pdf">motion of no-confidence</a> [application, PDF] against President Jacob Zuma be voted on using a secret ballot. Zuma, who has been implicated in a series of corruption scandals, has survived similar past impeachment efforts and is also the leader of the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za">African National Congress</a> [official website] (ANC), which holds a majority in parliament. Mmusi Maimane, leader of the main opposition <a href="https://www.da.org.za">Democratic Alliance party</a> [official website], told protesters that a secret ballot would force "ANC members of parliament to choose between what is best for the themselves and what is best for South Africa."</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Zuma has faced controversy in South Africa politics. Zuma was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but was ultimately acquitted and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as African National Congress deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov">US State Department</a> [official website] said Monday that it has <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/05/270865.htm">evidence</a> [official transcript] showing the Syrian government has been using crematoriums to dispose of inmates' bodies in the <a href="https://saydnaya.amnesty.org">Saydnaya prison</a> [AI backgrounder]. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/bureau/263947.htm">Stuart Jones</a> [official profile] asserted that about 70 people are held in each five-person capacity prison cell and approximately 50 inmates are killed each day. During his briefing, Jones presented photographs showing some evidence of the building believed to be a crematorium. He highlighted the melting snow on top of the roof as proof that the building is kept at a higher temperature than the other buildings. Jones cited the regime's various acts of violence to support his premise: <blockquote>Since 2012, the regime has routinely conducted airstrikes and artillery strikes in dense urban centers, including with barrel bombs, improvised unguided bombs, which are sometimes described as air-dropped IEDs. . . In addition to airstrikes, the regime continues to systematically abduct and torture civilian detainees, often beating, electrocuting, and raping these victims. . . Moreover, the regime has also authorized the extrajudicial killings of thousands of detainees using mass hangings at the Saydnaya military prison. . . Although the regime's many atrocities are well-documented, we believe that the building of a crematorium is an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place in Saydnaya prison.</blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to insight violence on civilians, prisoners and opposition forces. Earlier in May <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported new evidence that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in at least <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-syria-used-chemical-weapons-in-multiple-attacks.php">four recent attacks</a> [JURIST report] targeting civilians. In February, according to HRW, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel controlled portions of Aleppo. The same month, Amnesty International reported that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">more than 13,000 prisoners were hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at the prison. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald Trump's administration <a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/05/270866.htm">announced</a> [press release] plans Monday to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/">US Agency for International Development</a> [official website] to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Trump's plan, named "Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance", implements "the manner in which U.S. Government Departments and Agencies will apply the provisions of the Mexico City Policy to foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive U.S. funding for global health assistance." The plan originally only covered about $600 million in family planning funds but now extends to all roughly $9 billion international health care aid provided by the US government. The State Department said: "All foreign NGOs will have the opportunity to receive global health assistance awards if they indicate their agreement to abide by the terms of Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance by accepting the provisions in their award." In a statement to <a href="http://www1.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2017/05/14/brody-file-exclusive-trump-administration-to-significantly-expand-pro-life-mexico-city-policy">Christian Broadcasting Network News</a> [CBNNews report], a White House official said, "Foreign NGOs that agree not to perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, or provide financial support to any other foreign non-governmental organization that conducts such activities, will remain eligible for global health assistance funding." Since many NGO clinics offer family planning in addition to other healthcare services, opponents argue the restriction will drastically reduce access to healthcare for those in rural areas.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to be a controversial issue in the US. In April UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-sg-objects-to-us-cuts-to-reproductive-fund.php">voiced deep regret</a> [JURIST report] regarding US decision to cut financial support for the UN population agency over allegations of its involvement in coercive abortions and involuntary sterilization in China. In February the US House of Representatives recently <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST commentary] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. That same month the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the Mandatory Delay Law, which requires that a woman wait for 24 hours after receiving counseling from a physician before she can have an abortion. Also in February the <a href="http://www.pasen.gov/">Pennsylvania Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] (ICJ) on Monday <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19428.pdf">heard the case</a> [press release] of the coming execution of Indian officer <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-kulbhushan-jadhav-the-hindu-explains/article17907888.ece">Kulbhushan Jadhav</a> [The Hindu backgrounder] who was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] by a Pakistani Field General Court Martial earlier this year. Both India and Pakistan made their arguments before the court, wherein India accused Pakistan of violating the <a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf">Vienna Convention</a> [text] and conducting a "farcical trial." India also demanded an immediate suspension of Jadhav's death sentence, expressing fears that Pakistan would execute him prior to the end of the ICJ hearing. In response, Pakistan argued that the case is a matter of national security and the ICJ lacks jurisdiction over the outcome. Jadhav, an Indian national and former member of the Indian Navy, has been in Pakistan's custody since March of 2016.</p>

<p>Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December 2014 in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] that month, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, in March of last year the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">are minors</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday said they have <a href="https://securelist.com/blog/research/78431/wannacry-and-lazarus-group-the-missing-link/">found evidence</a> [Kapersky Lab report] that could link North Korea to the recent cyberattack that affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries over the weekend. The so-called WannaCry ransomware has lines of code that are identical to the malware used by a group of hackers called Lazarus that have been connected to North Korea in the past. Lazarus has also been linked to the hacking of <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/">Sony Pictures</a> [official website] in 2014 and accused of stealing millions of dollars from a Bangladeshi bank in 2016. Although North Korea denied allegations that it was behind those events, Simon Choi, a senior researcher who has done extensive investigations into North Korea's hacking programs said the WannaCry program is "similar to North Korea's backdoor malicious codes." WannaCry also includes software that was stolen from the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">US National Security Agency</a> [official website] and illegally published online in April. The software, which targeted <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/">Microsoft Windows</a> [official website] operating systems, encrypts data and demands ransom payments in the form of <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoins</a> [organization website]. The breadth and speed of the attack was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39907965">described</a> [BBC report] by <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/">Europol </a>[official website] as "unprecedented." </p>

<p>Cyber security is a growing threat around the world. On Thursday US President Donald Trump signed an <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-signs-executive-order-on-cybersecurity.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] designed to strengthen IT and cyber security frameworks in the country by having agency heads manage security risks and modernize the IT infrastructure.The National Control Commission for the Election Campaign for the Presidential Election (CNCCEP) last week <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/commission-warns-journalist-may-face-prosecution-if-publish-hacking-info.php">cautioned</a> [JURIST report] media outlets against sharing information leaked from an alleged hack of a presidential candidate. in April Roman Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russian-man-receives-longest-ever-cybercrime-sentence.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for hacking into more than 500 US businesses, stealing then selling millions of credit card numbers. Also in April the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/doj-disables-kelihos-botnet-after-arrest-of-russia-hacker.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it had effectively disrupted the Kelihos botnet, a network of thousands of virus ridden computers used to glean personal information and login credentials by distributing malicious software through spam email.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a five-day mutiny soldiers in the Ivory Coast on Tuesday <a href="http://www.gouv.ci/_actualite-article.php?recordID=7615">agreed to a government settlement</a> [press release] to end the disruption. The mutiny <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ivorycoast-military-agreement-idUSKCN18C0ZP">began</a> [Reuters report] Friday when soldiers began firing bullets at the army headquarters in the central business district of Abidjan, the economic capital, and in several army barracks located nearby. The military then seized control of Bouaké, the second largest city, and proceeded to launch uprisings in at least six other towns and cities across the country. The mutiny comes as a result of some 8,400 former rebels, now embedded into the army, demanding money due from four years fought without pay in support of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12934834">President Allassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile]. The government has agreed to give the soldiers an immediate bonus payment and an additional payment the end of June. The mutiny raises concerns of a resurgence of violence similar to that seen during the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13287585">10-year civil war</a> [BBC backgrounder] on the Ivory Coast, which ended in 2011.</p>

<p>The Ivory Coast has faced turmoil since 2010 when former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=gbagbo&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">news archive</a>] lost his second presidential race to former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile]. The EU recognized that Ouattara defeated Gbagbo, but Gbagbo refused to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/former-ivory-coast-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-war-crimes.php">concede victory</a> [JURIST report]. Gbagbo has been <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-victims-of-ivory-coast-election-violence-must-not-be-forgotten.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of starting a civil war after losing the presidency, which resulted in 3,000 deaths and the displacement of one million people. Voters in the Ivory Coast successfully <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/ivory-coast-president-signs-new-constitution.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution last year. In November, Oattara <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/11/ivory-coast-president-signs-new-constitution.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the constitution into law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201712167.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] Georgia death row inmate J.W. Ledford's request that his execution be carried out by firing squad rather than lethal injection. Ledford's counsel argued that lethal injection would violate constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment because Ledford has been taking a prescribed drug that would prevent the lethal injection protocol from operating as intended. The court ruled that because execution by lethal injection has already been ruled constitutional, Georgia did not need to "experiment with execution by . . .firing squad." Ledford was convicted after robbing and murdering his neighbor in 1992 and was "unanimously recommended imposition of the death penalty." Ledford's attorneys will likely <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-georgia-execution-idUSKCN18C104">appeal</a> [Reuters report] to the Supreme Court, but if the execution goes through, it will be the 70th execution in Georgia since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.</p>

<p>Use of the death penalty remains a controversial issue throughout the US. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">Delaware House of Representatives</a> [JURIST report] passed a <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail?LegislationId=25590">bill</a> [text] that would reinstate the death penalty. In April, Arkansas <a href="/forum/2017/03/Valena-Beety-death-penalty.php">planned</a> [JURIST op-ed] to execute eight people over ten days, but this planned was later blocked by US District Court Judge Kristine Bakerby <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-execution-plan.php">issuing</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/sites/ared/files/Preliminary%20Injuction%20Order.pdf">temporary injunction</a> [text, PDF]. In March, Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] signed a new <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/0280/">bill</a> [SB 280, materials] which stated that the death penalty may only be <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Mississippi man was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/mississippi-man-sentenced-49-years-prison-bias-motivated-murder-transgender-woman-lucedale">sentenced</a> [DOJ statement] to 49 years in prison and a fine of $20,000 on Monday in the first-ever conviction under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/249">Matthew Shepard, James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act</a> [text], a federal hate crime statute. Joshua Vallum murdered Mercedes Williamson in May 2015. Vallum <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/us/transgender-hate-crime-murder-sentence-mississippi/">initially claimed </a>[CNN report] that he killed Williamson in a panic upon learning that she was transgender. He later admitted to lying when he pleaded guilty and that he had decided to kill her after a friend learned that Williamson was transgender. As a member of a crime gang, the Latin Kings, Vallum said believed his life would be in danger if other members learned that he engaged in sexual relationship with a transgender woman. "Today's sentencing reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. "The Justice Department will continue its efforts to vindicate the rights of those individuals who are affected by bias motivated crimes." Vallum also plead guilty to an earlier murder charge for which he is serving a separate life sentence.</p>

<p>Transgender rights have been a controversial issue in recent months, mostly concerning access to bathrooms. In April the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina concerning a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 last month with the passage of House Bill 142. In February, six Democrats in the North Carolina House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/north-carolina-lawmakers-introduce-bathroom-bill-repeal.php">filed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to repeal HB2. Last May, former governor Pat McCrory filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill, but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST reports] from the lawsuit in September. In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/">European Court of Justice (ECJ) </a>[official site] on Tuesday <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-05/cp170052en.pdf">ruled</a> [press release, PDF] member states must sign off on trade deals before they become law. The<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=190727&mode=req&pageIndex=1&dir=&occ=first&part=1&text=&doclang=EN&cid=557478"> ruling</a> [text] found that the member states and the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union (EU)</a> [official website] share competence in many areas involving trade and if the EU does not hold exclusive competence the member states must ratify the measure. The ruling centered on a free trade agreement between the EU and Singapore that was referred to the court for legal clarity. The court found the EU had competence in intellectual property rights and sustainable development, but they can not determine dispute settlements and non-direct foreign investment. </p>

<p>The ECJ continues to rule on contested jurisdictional issues. The ECJ on Thursday <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">issued a non-binding opinion</a> [JURIST report] finding that Uber is a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. The ECJ in April <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/european-court-of-justice-upholds-visa-ban-for-iran-student.php">upheld </a>[JURIST report] a visa ban on an Iranian student seeking to study in Germany. In March the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php"> ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the bloc's economic sanctions placed on Russia were valid. Also in March the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-rejects-argument-that-tamil-tigers-did-not-engage-in-terrorist-acts.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an argument by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam requesting that their activities not be classified as "terrorist acts."<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Representative <a href="https://chaffetz.house.gov/">Jason Chaffetz</a> [official website], chairman of the <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/">House Oversight Committee</a> [official website], sent a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-05-16-JEC-to-McCabe-FBI-Memos.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations on Tuesday requesting "all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to communications between [fired FBI Director James] Comey and [President Donald] Trump." The request came hours after the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/james-comey-trump-flynn-russia-investigation.html?_r=0">reported</a> [text] the existence of a memo drafted by Comey detailing a closed-door meeting between himself and the president, wherein Trump allegedly asked Comey to discontinue an investigation of former National Security Advisor Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, saying "I hope you can let this go." Chaffetz, a Republican, issued the letter following a request to do so in <a href="https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/All%20Oversight%20and%20Judiciary%20Dems%20to%20Chairs%2005-16-17.pdf">a more detailed letter</a> [text, PDF] signed by the 33 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee and House Judiciary Committee. </p>

<p>Chaffetz gave a deadline for FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe to produce the requested material by May 24, citing <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/house-rules.pdf">House Rule X</a> [text, PDF] as authority. He has <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/864616135466950656">indicated</a> [Twitter post] a willingness to subpoena the FBI to obtain the documents if necessary, writing "I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready." </p>

<p>Trump's administration has faced significant scrutiny over alleged connections to Russia and its handling of investigations into those allegations. Last week, the acting FBI director said the bureau would continue <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/acting-fbi-director-says-agency-will-continue-investigation-despite-comey-firing.php">its investigation</a> into the allegations following the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">firing of Comey</a> [JURIST report] days earlier. In addition to the FBI, both the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/04/nunes-steps-down-from-house-investigation-on-russia.php">House</a> and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/senate-intelligence-committee-subpoenas-former-nsa-leader-flynn.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] Intelligence Committees have held hearings on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&Datum=2017-5-16&nr=78289&linked=pm&Blank=1">ruled</a> [press release, in German] Tuesday that government websites can store personal data as long as they provide adequate justification. Patrick Beyer sued the German government over the storing of IP addresses, which he believed to be in violation of data protection laws. The Federal Court of Justice presented the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg which <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-10/cp160112en.pdf">gave</a> [press release] its decision in October of 2016. The ICJ ruled similarly to the Federal Court in that the data collection did not violate law. The court stated that is the storing of an IP address can be legal if the operator of the website has a "legitimate interest" to do so. </p>

<p>Privacy on the internet remains a prominent issue around the world. In the United States, President Donald Trump in April officially <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-repeals-fcc-internet-privacy-rules-requiring-consumer-consent.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] internet privacy regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term. This decision made it no longer necessary for providers to seek consumer consent before sharing or selling their private information. JURIST guest columnist Andreas Kuersten discusses the recent trend of governments <a href="/hotline/2017/04/Andreas-Kuersten-internet-consumer-privacy.php">selling personal data</a> [JURIST op-ed] to without their consent.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/tbmm_internet.anasayfa">Turkish Parliament</a> [official website] elected <a href="http://www.bursadabugun.com/haber/meclis-te-hsk-uyeleri-secildi-829070.html">seven new members</a> [vote counts;<em>Bursada Bugun</em> report, in Turkish] to the country's 13-member Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK) in an overnight vote Wednesday under changes made to the constitution in a referendum last month. The HSK has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-idUSKCN18D0T9">broad judicial power</a> [Reuters report] in Turkey, overseeing "the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplining and dismissal of judges and prosecutors." The new members are all candidates of <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/">President Tayyip Erdogan's</a> [official website] ruling AK Party or its ally, the <a href="http://www.mhp.org.tr/mhp_index.php">Nationalist Movement Party</a> [official websites, in Turkish]. Critics of the move, including members of the pro-Kurdish <a href="http://www.hdp.org.tr/">People's Democratic Party</a> and the secularist <a href="http://www.chp.org.tr/">Republican People's Party</a> [official websites, in Turkish], say the changes to the constitution which allow the appointments are "illegitimate," and give too much power to Erdogan and the AK Party. Supporters of Erdogan say <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/turkey-parliament-approves-plan-to-strengthen-presidential-powers.php">the expansion of his power</a> [JURIST report], as well as the expulsion of 4,238 judges and prosecutors who were politically aligned with US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, is necessary to combat Kurdish and Islamist militants. </p>

<p>Since the failed coup in Turkey in July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. Last month, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkish-justice-minister-warns-against-challenge-to-referendum-expanding-presidential-powers.php">said</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://constitutionalcourt.gov.tr/">Turkish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] would reject any opposition challenge to the referendum that expanded Erdogan's powers, and the European Court of Human Rights had no jurisdiction on the matter. In March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights published a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-reports-recent-human-rights-violations-in-southern-turkey.php">report</a> [JURIST report] describing a plethora of human rights violations committed by the Turkish government between July 2015 and December 2016. Also in March around 330 individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for alleged involvement in an attempted coup. In November Turkey significantly restricted the activities of NGOs like human rights organizations and children's groups and <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested opposition party leaders </a>[JURIST report] alleging they were connected to terror organizations. In October Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/hrw-turkish-emergency-decrees-permitting-government-sanctioned-torture.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the emergency decrees put in place after the failed coup, had resulted in serious human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea Manning was released from US Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, a military prison, on Wednesday. In 2013 Manning was convicted of stealing 700,000 documents and releasing them to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [advocacy website] while she was an intelligence analyst in Iraq. WikiLeaks founder <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-11047811">Julian Assange</a> [BBC profile], who is under criminal investigation in the US and Sweden, has agreed to accept extradition if Manning was freed. Manning, who was once known as Private First Class Bradley Manning, was the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/17/politics/chelsea-manning-release/index.html">first service member</a> [CNN report] to undergo gender reassignment surgery while detained in military prison. <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [official website], who campaigned for Manning's release, issued a <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/chelsea-manning-finally-free-after-cruel-ordeal/">statement</a> [press release] saying, "While we celebrate her freedom, we will continue to call for an independent investigation into the potential human rights violations she exposed, and for protections to be put in place to ensure whistleblowers like Chelsea are never again subjected to such appalling treatment."</p>

<p>Manning served 7 of her 35 year sentenced term, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/chelsea-manning-leaves-prison.html">unprecedented sentence</a> [NYT report] for disclosing secret files. In one of his last acts in office, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/obama-commutes-chelsea-mannings-sentence.php">commuted</a> [JURIST report] the remainder of her sentence. In September Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-sentenced-to-solitary-confinement-over-suicide-attempt.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two weeks of solitary confinement over a suicide attempt she made while transitioning and the possession of a banned book. Earlier in September, Manning ended a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-prison-treatment.php">five-day hunger strike</a> after the Army agreed to allow her to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-to-undergo-gender-reassignment-surgery-following-hunger-strike.php">undergo gender reassignment surgery</a> [JURIST reports]. In May Manning <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/chelsea-manning-appeals-35-year-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her 35-year prison sentence. In 2013 Manning filed for a presidential pardon of the 35-year sentence. In February 2013 Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to WikiLeaks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1288_en.htm">sent</a> [press release] a letter asking for Italy's response to allegations that <a href="https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/Pages/home.aspx">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Group</a> [official website] used illegal emissions control devices. The letter is the first step in infringement proceedings against Italy. The European Commission has requested that Italy provide justification for its legal treatment of Fiat's emission control strategies. Italy has two months to respond to the letter. Allegations of illegal emission control devices in Fiat's vehicles were brought by the German Transport Ministry in September 2016.</p>

<p>The allegations against Fiat are similar to allegations against Volkswagen, who was also accused of circumventing emission testing through installed software and equipment. Earlier this month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-approves-volkswagen-emissions-settlement.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] of a settlement case against Volkswagen regarding their 3.0-liter vehicles. In April, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/german-court-allows-use-of-seized-evidence-against-volkswagen.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the seizure of evidence against Volkswagen obtained during a raid of the law firm Jones Day. In December, South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-to-file-criminal-action-against-volkswagen.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to fine the company for false advertising. In October, a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/spain-court-orders-vw-to-pay-car-owner-over-emisions-scandal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Volkswagen to pay a car owner €5,006 for the 10% decrease in the car's value due to the emissions cheating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US District Court of the Southern District of New York on Wednesday began hearings on the restructuring of Puerto Rico's debt. The hearing stems from Puerto Rico <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/puerto-rico-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-under-special-law.php">filing for bankruptcy protection</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2016/A-021-2016.pdf">Article 3 of PROMESA</a> [text] for its $70 billion debt earlier this month. Chief Justice Roberts <a href="http://www.sdnyblog.com/files/2017/05/17-Civ.-01578-Order.pdf">appointed</a> [text, PDF] Judge Laura Taylor Swain two weeks ago to hear the case as she has an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/business/dealbook/judge-puerto-rico-case.html">extensive history</a> [NYT backgrounder] in large debt cases. While proceedings opened up this morning, reports have emerged that the main creditors are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-hearing-idUSKCN18D0D9">interested in mediation talks</a> [Reuters report] to resolve the debt. </p>

<p>Puerto Rico has been seeking multiple avenues to solve the debt issue and have faced numerous problems with the debt. In February Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló  <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/puerto-rico-governor-approves-statehood-referendum.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] to hold nonbinding referendum that would allow the US territory to vote on statehood. The referendum is to be held in June. The Governor Ricardo Rossello<a href="/paperchase/2017/01/puerto-rico-governor-signs-controversial-labor-reform-bill.php"> signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in January a heavily-debated labor reform bill. The same month the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-puerto-rico-pension-bondholders-case-to-proceed.php">ruled that bondholders</a> [JURIST report] of Puerto Rico's Employee Retirement System deserve a hearing to determine if their case has merit to proceed. Last June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-against-puerto-rico-on-debt-restructuring.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust that Section 903(1) of the Bankruptcy Code preempts Puerto Rico's Recovery Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal">European Parliament</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2017-0216+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN">resolution</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday accusing Hungary of engaging in actions which have resulted in the "serious deterioration of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights." The organization particularly focused on human rights of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees as well as freedom of education. It <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20170511IPR74350/fundamental-rights-in-hungary-meps-call-for-triggering-article-7">calls for</a> [press release] "the Hungarian Government to repeal laws tightening rules against asylum-seekers and non-governmental organisations, and to reach an agreement with the US authorities, making it possible for Central European University to remain in Budapest as a free institution." They are also requesting that any EU funds to Hungary be monitored by the European Commission. The resolution was passed by a vote of 393 to 221, with 64 abstentions. </p>

<p>Hungary has been several investigations in recent years. In April, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/eu-opens-investigation-into-hungary-education-law.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into Hungary's recent Higher Education law that was meant to close the Central European university. The International Federation for Human Rights had <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/rights-group-urges-eu-to-address-hungarys-attack-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the EU in November to better address Hungary's sustained attack on human rights. In February 2015, Human Rights Watch had <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the EU for not taking action against Hungary's laws and practices relating to human rights. In 2013 the Hungarian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hungary-to-propose-further-constitutional-amendments.php">enacted constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] after receiving criticism over its 2012 amendments. HRW and other human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hungary-constitution-changes-do-not-go-far-enough-hrw.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the changes as "largely cosmetic," highlighting a lack of resolve over issues surrounding weakened human rights protections in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former FBI director Robert Mueller was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel">appointed</a> [DOJ statement] as special counsel to the investigation of Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election on Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein issued the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3726381/Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] in place of Attorney General Jeff Session who recused himself after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/us/politics/robert-mueller-special-counsel-russia-investigation.html?_r=0">admitting</a> [NYT report] he had failed to disclose meetings he had with a Russian ambassador while he was serving as an advisor to the Trump campaign. Mueller is authorized to investigate any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump with or without consulting the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website]. As special counsel, Mueller <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39961732">will be able to</a> [BBC report] issue subpoenas, bring criminal charges, and can prosecute anyone who interferes in his investigation through crimes including perjury, destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice, and intimidation of witnesses. Mueller can only be fired by Rosenstein for "good cause" which includes dereliction of duty, misconduct, conflict of interest, incapacity, and violation of department policies. This is only the second time the Justice Department has appointed a special counsel, the first being in 1999 when the law which created the position took effect. </p>

<p>The White House issued a formal <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/17/statement-president-donald-j-trump">statement</a> [text] from Trump following the appointment: <blockquote>As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity.  I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.  In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country.</blockquote> On Thursday morning, Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/865173176854204416">called the investigation</a> [Twitter post] "the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!" </p>

<p>Robert Mueller served as director of the FBI under both Presidents Bush and Obama. He took the position of director just one week before the 9/11 attacks and is credited with rebuilding the FBI during the aftermath. Mueller worked closely with fellow former FBI director James Comey who was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] last week. Mueller is viewed as one of the most reliable and credible law enforcement officials in the country by both democrats and republicans, although some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/deputy-attorney-general-appoints-special-counsel-to-oversee-probe-of-russian-interference-in-election/2017/05/17/302c1774-3b49-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c_story.html?utm_term=.39dd8e861554">are still calling</a> [WP report] for an independent commission to lead an investigation as well. California Representative and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee <a href="https://schiff.house.gov/">Adam Schiff</a> [official website] <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/864867748438044674">said</a> [Twitter post] "Both are warranted" because "An independent commission has a very different purpose than an independent prosecutor." Others are concerned with Muellers employment with <a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/">WilmerHale</a> [official website], the law firm that represented Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Mueller is expected to announce his resignation from the firm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Court of Justice on Thursday <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/168/19440.pdf">instructed</a> [press release] Pakistan to withhold the execution of an Indian national  until after the court's final decision his case. The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=1&code=ipak&case=168&k=b8"> Jadhav Case (India v. Pakistan)</a>  [ICJ docket] centers on alleged violations of consular rights that predated the <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/pakistan-military-court-sentences-detained-indian-naval-officer-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report]  of Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav, who is accused of being a spy. India brought the case before the court arguing they have no knowledge of the charges against Jadhav, nor are they aware of the judicial proceedings against him. The ICJ  noted they have jurisdiction to hear the issues and indicated Pakistan did not promised to suspend the execution as justification for their ruling. <blockquote>The Court concludes by indicating the following measures: Pakistan shall take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Mr. Jadhav is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings and shall inform the Court of all the measures taken in implementation of the present Order. The Court also decides that, until it has given its final decision, it shall remain seised of the matters which form the subject-matter of this Order.</blockquote> The execution is scheduled for August. </p>

<p>Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December 2014 in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] that month, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, in March of last year the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting<a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php"> hangings for all prisoners </a>[JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">are minors</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website], found that in order to avoid anti-trust concerns, Facebook stated that it could not automatically match users between Facebook and WhatsApp when it purchased the company in 2014. The European Commission states that the technology to automatically match users existed in 2014 and that Facebook staff were aware of that. Facebook alleges that the missing information in the 2014 merger deal was not intentional. </p>

<p>Facebook was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/facebook/about/">founded </a> [official profile] in 2004 and is one of the most popular social media networking websites today. Its popularity has subjecting it to numerous lawsuits. In May the <a href="http://broadcasting.nbtc.go.th/wps/portal/Eng/Home">National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission of Thailand</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/thailand-orders-facebook-to-remove-posts-about-king.php">ordered </a> [JURIST report] Facebook to remove a video of King Maha Vajiralongkorn or face legal action.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_6gbFPjVDoxaEVNNmJrZHNtVGc/edit">granted</a> [order, PDF]  a temporary restraining order to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. <a href="https://www.nwirp.org/">Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP) </a> [advocacy website]  filed <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/cases/nwirp-v-sessions">NWIRP v. Sessions </a> [case summary] after being informed by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR)  they could no longer provide legal advice to individuals unless they offered full representation of the clients. NWIRP argued the EOIR enforcement would leave them unable to assist the immigrates as there were too many to provide full representation for. The group had previously agreed to inform the court if they worked on a case in any capacity by including a note on all documents they had assisted with. <blockquote>The Court finds that NWIRP met its burden to show that it is immediately and irreparably harmed, and will continue to be so harmed, as a result of EOIR's enforcement ... against NWIRP attorneys ... These harms are significant and ongoing, and the Court therefore finds that entering this TRO against the Government is necessary to maintain the status quo until such time as the Court may hear and decide the matter of a preliminary injunction.</blockquote> NWIRP <a href="https://www.nwirp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Jorge-Statement-on-Todays-Ruling-5.17.17.png">stated</a> [press release] they are pleased with the ruling. </p>

<p>Immigration legal issues continue in the judicial systems. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/appeals-court-hears-travel-ban-oral-argument.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] arguments Monday on the Trump administration's revised ban on travelers coming into the US from selected majority Muslim countries. The <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order. Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">signed </a>[JURIST report] into law a bill [SB 4, text] last Sunday banning so-called "sanctuary cities" in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/house-passes-syria-sanctions-bill/">passed a bill</a> [press release] Wednesday to impose sanctions on supporters of Syria's Assad regime. <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr1677/BILLS-115hr1677ih.pdf">Bill 1677</a> [text, PDF], also known as Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, is hoped to encourage negotiations to end violence and promote the prosecution of war criminals. Chairman Ed Royce delivered a speech on the House floor urging members to vote on the bill and recounted the atrocities people face in Syria. Chairman Royce further stated that, "Syria can't keep going on and on like this. That's not in our humanitarian interest, the interest of the region, or America's national security interest. This has to change." Supporters of the bill assert that it will halt Assad's power and end the violent conflict that has led to about 500,000 lives being taken. The bill must still pass the US Senate and be signed by the President before becoming law.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact on the country. In April the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] conducted emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-security-council-holds-emergency-talks-after-suspected-chemical-attack-in-syria.php">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. That same month, Russia <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-blocks-un-condemnation-of-syria-domestic-attack.php">vetoed </a> [JURIST report] a UN Security Council resolution that would have condemned Syrian president <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">Bashar al-Assad's</a> use of neurological gas against a Syrian town. Also that month, the US military attacked <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/us-military-has-launched-more-50-than-missiles-aimed-at-syria-nbc-news.html">Syria-government airfield with 59 Tomahawk missiles</a> [CNBC News]. In February, according to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">HRW </a>[advocacy site], the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted </a>[JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo. In the same month, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">more than 13,000 prisoners were hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at Saydnaya prison. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby was found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the shooting of an unarmed black man on Wednesday. Terence Crutcher was fatally shot after his SUV stalled on the side of the road. Shelby <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/18/528915380/tulsa-police-officer-is-found-not-guilty-in-death-of-terence-crutcher">testified</a> [NPR report] that she feared Crutcher was under the influence of PCP, a hallucinogen that causes erratic, combative behavior. According to her testimony, Crutcher ignored the officers on scene and placed his hands on the SUV and began to reach inside when Shelby fired shots. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/21/us/terence-crutcher-police-shooting-point-counterpoint/">Videos</a> [CNN archive] from Shelby's dashboard camera and a police helicopter show Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his hands in the air. Shelby was arrested shortly after the videos were released. </p>

<p>Use of police force has been questioned on a national scale recently. Earlier in May the <a href="http://www.dallascounty.org/department/sheriff/sheriff_index.php">Dallas County Sheriff's Department</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/police-officer-charges-with-murder-of-15-year-old-jordan-edwards.php">arrest warrant </a>[JURIST report] for former Police Officer Roy Oliver over the murder of Jordan Edwards, a young black man.  In 2015 Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/chicago-police-officer-charged-with-first-degree-murder.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with first-degree murder for the death of black teenager Laquan McDonald in October 2014. That same year an Ohio grand jury decided <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Also in 2014 a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, decided <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">not to indict</a> [JURIST report] police officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown in August of that year. In 2013 the UN Working Group of Experts of People of African Descent and the UN Special Rapporteur on racism <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-experts-urge-us-finalize-zimmerman-trial-investigation.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] the US government to finalize its investigation into the case surrounding the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Trade Representative <a href="https://ustr.gov/">Robert Lighthizer</a> [official website] sent a <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/Press/Releases/NAFTA%20Notification.pdf">letter</a> [text] to Congress Thursday communicating the Trump administration's intention to begin the process of re-negotiating the <a href="https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/laws/italaw6187%286%29.pdf">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA) [text, PDF]. NAFTA is an international trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada, and has been in place since 1994. Lighthizer cited a lack of modernity in light of more recent digital trade developments as the reason for renegotiation. Lighthizer wrote:<br />
<blockquote>In particular, we note that NAFTA was negotiated over 25 years ago, and while our economy and businesses have changed considerably over that period, NAFTA has not. Many chapters are outdated and do not reflect modern standards. For example, digital trade was in its infancy when NAFTA was enacted. In addition, and consistent with the negotiation objectives in the Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, our aim is that NAFTA be modernized.</blockquote>US President Donald Trump had previously threatened to withdraw completely from the agreement. </p>

<p>The US' place in international trade has been uncertain since Donald Trump took office. The letter from Lighthizer comes on the heels of an executive order directing the Commerce Department and Lighthizer to review all US trade agreements and the country's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-orders-review-of-trade-agreements-wto-membership.php">determine the cause of the US trade deficit</a> [JURIST report]. The order called for a comprehensive review of whether previous free trade agreements and membership in the WTO have brought the benefits that were predicted. The order came just days after Trump announced he would not order a withdrawal from the NAFTA, but would rather renegotiate its terms with Canada and Mexico. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/28/press-briefing-secretary-commerce-wilbur-ross-executive-order-trade">Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross responded</a> [press briefing] to the order, stating that an analysis of NAFTA will be a significant part of the required study. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Brazilian Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday authorized a corruption probe into <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36070366">President Michel Temer</a> [BBC profile] and his alleged involvement with the bribery of a potential witness in a major corruption case. Local news sources have cited the court's decision, but the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.valor.com.br/politica/4973416/investigado-por-obstrucao-temer-diz-que-nao-renunciara">has yet to release a copy</a> [Valor Econômico report, in Portuguese] of the decision itself. Temer has responded that he will not resign and that he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-idUSKCN18E1YX">welcomes the investigation</a> [Reuters report] so his innocence can be proven.       </p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times as former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST report] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. Last month Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">ordered investigations into eight cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. The investigation was ordered on the tails of an anti-corruption measure that was passed last December by the Brazilian Lower Chamber of Deputies. <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/brazil-lawmakers-pass-anti-corruption-law-with-controversial-changes.php">"Operation Carwash"</a> [JURIST report] allows individuals who are subject to prosecution to seek criminal consequences against their prosecutors and judges if the officials abuse their powers. "Operation Carwash" was passed as charges have been filed against some of Brazil's most powerful politicians, including former president <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [JURIST report]. In late September former finance minister <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-corruption-probe.php">Antonio Palocci was arrested</a> [JURIST report]. In November <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">Rousseff's lawyers filed documents</a> [JURIST report] with the Superior Electoral Court in Brazil alleging that Temer was involved with bribery.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Oregon becomes second state to ease transgender ID changes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oregon became the second US state to enact <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2673">legislation</a> [HB 2673A materials] that makes it easier for transgender individuals to change the name and gender on their birth certificates on Thursday. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oregon-transgender-idUSKCN18F02Z">law</a> [Reuters report] allows transgender Oregon residents to amend their name and gender identification by filling out a form rather than having to post a public notice in the county clerk's office and petition a court. The new system will allow for more privacy and is more cost effective as well. The process will cost an estimated $65 instead of the hundreds of dollars typically incurred by court fees. A 2015 survey conducted by the <a href="http://www.transequality.org/">National Center for Transgender Equality</a> [advocacy website] showed that just one in 10 transgender people have legal identification that matches their gender identity. Reduced costs and fewer processing hurdles will make it easier for transgender individuals to obtain the identification required to find jobs and receive access to medical care. The law was <a href="http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2017/5/18/oregon-eases-birth-certificate-changes-trans-people">signed</a> [Advocate report] by <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/gov/Pages/index.aspx">Governor Kate Brown</a> [official website], the nation's first openly bisexual governor, and will go into effect January 2018.</p>

<p>Transgender rights have been a controversial issue in recent months, mostly concerning access to bathrooms. In April the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina concerning a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 in March with the passage of House Bill 142. Last May former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST reports] from the lawsuit in September. In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sweden's Director of Public Prosecution, Marianne Ny, <a href="https://www.aklagare.se/globalassets/dokument/ovriga-dokument/decision-20170519.pdf">dropped</a> [decision, PDF] the preliminary investigation of rape charges against <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [official website] founder Julian Assange on Friday. The decision was made on the grounds that in order to continue with court proceedings, Assange would need to be physically present. Assange has been protected by asylum, living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since 2012 when he lost a court battle over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/19/swedish-prosecutors-drop-julian-assange-investigation">extradition</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to Sweden for the rape charges. He feared that extradition to Sweden would lead to extradition to the US where he is wanted for leaking thousands of classified documents. Although the UK has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/europe/julian-assange-sweden-charges-dropped/">not commented</a> [CNN report] as to whether it has received an extradition request from the US, a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39973864">treaty</a> [BBC report] between to the two countries would allow British authorities to arrest Assange and send him to the US. Ny <a href="https://www.aklagare.se/en/nyheter--press/press-releases/?newsId=D4CC929291BC29E2">did not discount</a> [press release] the possibility of attempting to prosecute Assange in the future, saying, "If he, at a later date, makes himself available, I will be able to decide to resume the investigation immediately."</p>

<p>The arrest warrant against Assange was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/sweden-court-upholds-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] eight times. All of the rulings have been against Assange until now. The <a href="/forum/2011/06/ashley-savage-whistleblowing.php">WikiLeaks controversy</a> [JURIST op-ed] has also garnered much debate in the US. Last year US Army Major General Jeffery Buchanan <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/army-general-denies-chelsea-mannings-request-for-clemency.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Private Chelsea Manning's conviction and prison sentence for turning over classified information to WikiLeaks. In September 2013 Manning filed for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports] she received in August. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/chelsea-manning-released-from-military-prison.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from military prison earlier this week after serving seven of her 35 years. President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/obama-commutes-chelsea-mannings-sentence.php">commuted</a> [JURIST report] the remainder of her sentence as one of his final acts in office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://crpa.org/">California Rifle and Pistol Association</a> [advocacy website], the state affiliate of the National Rifle Association (NRA), filed a <a href="http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Duncan-v.-Becerra_Filed-5-17-17_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday seeking to prevent California from enforcing stricter gun laws. The complaint seeks declaratory and  injunctive relief against the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&sectionNum=32310.">measure</a> [section 32310] that limits magazine capacity to 10 rounds. The complaint argues the restrictions are in violation of the constitutional right to carry arms and due process:<blockquote>Finally, Section 32310 violates the Due Process Clause. Banning magazines over ten rounds is no more likely to reduce criminal abuse of guns than banning high horsepower engines is likely to reduce criminal abuse of automobiles. To the contrary, the only thing the ban ensures is that a criminal unlawfully carrying a firearm with a magazine over ten rounds will have a (potentially devastating) advantage over his law abiding victim. And Section 32310 raises particularly acute due process concerns because it criminalizes the continued possession of magazines that were lawful when acquired.</blockquote>The lawsuit is the <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20170518/lawsuit-filed-against-california-s-ban-on-standard-capacity-magazines">second in a series</a> [press release] that gun advocates plan to file against recent California gun restrictions. </p>

<p>Gun control remains a controversial domestic issue. The NRA in April <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nra-files-challenge-to-california-gun-control-legislation.php">filed the first complaint</a> [JURIST report] challenging the California gun laws last month. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/iowa-governor-signs-law-expanding-gun-rights.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] in April expanding gun rights in the state. House File 517 gives gun owners the ability to defend themselves in public and prevents local governments from implementing their own rules. South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/south-dakota-governor-vetoes-bills-seeking-to-loosen-gun-control-laws.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that would have loosened the state's regulations on concealed carry laws. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-house-approves-bill-making-it-easier-for-mentally-incompetent-veterans-to-purchase-guns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report} a bill in March making it easier for certain veterans to obtain firearms</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">US Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0090.aspx">announced sanctions</a> [press release] against eight Venezuelan Supreme Court justices for usurping democracy. The sanctions come after the court has issued controversial rulings, including <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolving the legislature</a> [JURIST report]. The rulings were <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/venezuela-supreme-court-reverses-ruling-after-protests.php">met with backlash</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/amnesty-calls-for-venezuela-police-retraint-during-protests.php">protests</a> [JURIST reports]. As a result the treasury announced sanctions against the justices pursuant to <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/venezuela.aspx">Executive Order 13692</a> [summary]:<blockquote>The eight officials are the President of Venezuela's TSJ, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, and the seven principal members of the TSJ's Constitutional Chamber (La Sala Constitucional del TSJ or TSJ-C): Juan Jose Mendoza Jover (Second Vice President of the TSJ and President of the TSJ-C); Arcadio de Jesus Delgado Rosales (Vice President of the TSJ-C); Gladys Maria Gutierrez Alvarado (Magistrate of the TSJ-C and former President of the TSJ); Carmen Auxiliadora Zuleta de Merchan (Magistrate of the TSJ-C); Luis Fernando Damiani Bustillos (Magistrate of the TSJ-C); Lourdes Benicia Suarez Anderson (Magistrate of the TSJ-C); and Calixto Antonio Ortega Rios (Magistrate of the TSJ-C). As a result of today's actions, all of the designated individuals' assets within U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them</blockquote>The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/house-passes-bill-to-impose-sanctions-on-assad-supporters.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday to impose sanctions on supporters of Syria's Assad regime. Bill 1677, also known as Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, is intended to encourage negotiations to end violence and promote the prosecution of war criminals. The Ukrainian Security and Defense Council <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ukraine-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-tech-companies.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] sanctions on a series of Russian tech companies Tuesday, citing security concerns over possible cyber attack. The North Korean legislature on last Friday <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-sends-letter-to-us-congress-over-sanctions.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the US House of Representatives protesting new sanctions  raised against the country</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than a dozen Democratic attorneys general filed a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2017-05-18_-_states_motion_to_intervene.pdf">motion to intervene</a> [text, PDF] in a lawsuit that threatens key parts of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628/text">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text] on Thursday. <a href="https://jonathanturley.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/house-v-burwell-d-d-c-complaint-filed.pdf">House v. Price</a> (formerly <span class="casename">House v. Burwell</span>) [complaint, PDF], a suit currently pending in the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website], was filed in an attempt to cut subsidy payments to insurance plans that were created under the ACA that help cover out-of-pocket expenses for low-income Americans. Attorneys general from Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington state and the District of Columbia have joined <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/about-attorney-general">New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/about">California Attorney General Xavier Becerra</a> [official websites] on the motion. They argue that the "States have unique sovereign interests&#8212;in administering their insurance markets and safeguarding their residents&#8212;that the current parties cannot represent." They assert that cutting subsidy payments would increase the number of uninsured Americans, "hurting vulnerable individuals and directly burdening the States." If the replacement for the ACA, the American Health Care Act, passes in the Senate, the pending litigation will become moot. </p>

<p>Repealing the ACA has been a significant priority for President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers. In March an earlier version of the proposed American Health Care Act (AHCA) was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-healthcare-bill-withdrawn-from-congress-due-to-lack-of-votes.php">withdrawn from consideration</a> [JURIST report] after failing to get enough support to pass. Earlier that month, Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/republicans-present-modifications-to-aca-replacement-bill.php">released two amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the AHCA in an effort to appeal to both conservative and liberal critics. Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-senators-propose-first-aca-replacement-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] the initial ACA replacement bill at the end of January. This came after Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-issues-executive-order-seeking-repeal-of-aca.php">signed an executive orde</a>r [JURIST report] aimed at repealing the ACA, shortly after being sworn in. The Senate had prepared for the repealing of the ACA earlier that month when it <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/senate-takes-first-step-to-repeal-acaa.php">voted 51-48</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the process from being subject to a filibuster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romania's <a href="http://www.parlament.ro/index_en.html">parliament</a> [official website] approved legislation on Friday that facilitates financial support for Holocaust survivors. The law, which will be enforced starting July 1, will offer 400 lei (USD $97.98) per month for each year of deportation or detention to those who had their property taken or were forcefully removed from their homes to endure ghettos, concentration camps, death trains and forced labor. The restitution will be provided to those who are no longer Romanian citizens as well as living partners of Holocaust survivors provided they have not remarried. It is unclear how many are eligible for the payments or how much it will cost the Romanian government. Romania, an ally of Nazi Germany until August 1944, has a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-romania-holocaust-idUKKCN18F1D3">current population</a> [Reuters report] of fewer than 11,000 Jews. Most of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/world/europe/romania-holocaust-survivors-jews-restitution-claims.html?_r=0">beneficiaries</a> [NYT report] of the new law, who are in their 80s and 90s, have been fighting to regain their lost property in cases that can last years. More than 40,000 claims are still pending.</p>

<p>International courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. Last year, Reinhold Hanning, a 94-year-old former Schutzstaffel (SS) guard in the Auschwitz death camp between 1942 and 1944, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/94-year-old-former-ss-sergeant-apologizes-to-nazi-victims-at-trial-in-germany.php">apologized to Nazi victims at his trial in Detmold</a> [JURIST report], a small town in West Germany. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. In December 2015, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/germany-court-rules-accused-auschwitz-paramedic-fit-for-trial.php">German court allowed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of a 95-year-old Auschwitz paramedic accused of being an accessory to the murder of 3,681 people at Auschwitz. The most recent person imprisoned for their role in the Holocaust was Oskar Groening. Known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," G<a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">roening was charged</a> [JURIST report] in September 2014 as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. In July 2015 Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">said he would appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.almcms.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/292/2017/05/Automaker-settlement.pdf">settlement</a> [text, PDF] was reached between plaintiffs and several car manufacturers in a lawsuit concerning defective <a href="http://www.takata.com/en/">Takata</a> [official website] airbag inflators on Thursday. The faulty airbags would rupture and expel debris, causing injury and damage to the vehicle's cabin. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/18/528966358/4-car-companies-settle-takata-airbag-lawsuit-for-553-million">At least 16 deaths</a> [NPR report] were linked to the defect. <a href="https://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a>, <a href="https://www.subaru.com/">Subaru</a>, <a href="https://www.mazdausa.com/">Mazda</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</a> [corporate websites] will collectively pay out $553 million in a deal that covers nearly 16 million vehicles. The settlement will not cover personal injuries or damage to property but will compensate those who own cars with the defective airbags by providing rental cars. Claims against other auto manufacturers in the suit, including <a href="http://www.honda.com/">Honda</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a> and <a href="https://www.nissanusa.com/">Nissan</a> [corporate websites], are still pending.</p>

<p>Auto manufacturers have continued to face punishment for issues with their vehicles and parts in the US. In February Takata <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/takata-company-pleads-guilty-to-air-bag-fraud.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to wire fraud arising out of the airbag defects. In July the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/fiat-chrysler-faces-punishment-for-automotive-recall-issues.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] that Fiat Chrysler failed to provide a remedy and notices for 23 recalls related to malfunctions of their automobiles. In 2014 the US DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/doj-announces-12-billion-settlement-with-toyota.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a $1.2 billion settlement agreement with Toyota for misleading customers and US regulators. In November 2012 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/toyota-settles-shareholder-class-action-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit for $35.5 million brought by its shareholders for failing to disclose vehicle quality issues. In 2010 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay $32.4 million in fines following investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. JURIST Guest Columnist Bruce Aronson in 2011 <a href="/forum/2011/11/bruce-aronson-corporate-governanace.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the recent corporate scandals in Japan, including the Toyota recalls, highlight the need for reform of that country's corporate governance structure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Human Rights Division of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmiss/">United Nations Mission in South Sudan</a> (UNMISS) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/SS/UNMISSReportJuly2016_January2017.pdf">report</a> [PDF] on Friday that revealed the findings of a year-long investigation into human rights violations in the Yei Town, Central Equatoria area of South Sudan. The human rights violations stem from violence between the government and opposition forces led by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25402865"> Riek Machar </a> [BBC profile]. The report found 114 cases of Sudan's People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and allied militias killing civilians that were perceived to be supporters of the opposition group, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), based on their ethnicity. The documented cases <a href="https://unmiss.unmissions.org/un-report-exposes-human-rights-violations-and-abuses-against-civilians-and-around-yei-south-sudan">included</a> [press release] attacks on funerals, indiscriminate shelling of civilians, and sexual violence towards women and girls with an excessive degree of brutality. The report also found that the SPLA subjected civilians to detention and torture while looting and destroying their property. Aside from the casualties, these human rights violations has also led to the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians who are fleeing the ethnically motivated violence. The documented cases in the UN report refer mostly to violations committed by the SPLA because the government would not allow the investigators into areas that were occupied by opposition forces. However, the report does include a few cases of human rights violations committed by the SPLM. These cases include similar instances of murder, rape, and abduction.</p>

<p>The conditions in Sudan have been a pressing issue in the past few years. As recently as last month Eugene Owusu, the top United Nations official in South Sudan, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-warns-of-growing-humanitarian-crisis-in-south-sudan.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that without peace in South Sudan, humanitarian conditions would continue to deteriorate. Only days earlier Owusu made a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/south-sudan-un-official-urges-government-and-opposition-to-protect-civilians-and-aid-workers.php">similar plea</a> [JURIST report] to the government and opposition of South Sudan to ensure the protection of civilians and aid workers in the country. <a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which was officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">recognized</a> [JURIST report] as an independent nation in July 2011, has spent much of its brief history as a nation in civil war. In March, the Chair of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoHSouthSudan/Pages/Index.aspx">UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-in-south-sudan.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that there is a need to establish courts and bring prosecutions against those who have committed rights abuses throughout the nation's conflicts. In January, UNMISS <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-hundreds-raped-killed-in-south-sudan-by-military-groups-in-violent-july.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that a violent period in July 2016 left hundreds of civilians dead. In December the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-commission-ethnic-cleansing-underway-in-south-sudan.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that ethnic cleansing was occurring in South Sudan. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal appeals court: Arizona prison outgoing mail policy violates constitution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/05/18/16-15277.pdf">ruled</a> [Opinion, PDF] that the <a href="https://corrections.az.gov/">Arizona Department of Corrections</a>' (ADC) [official website] outgoing mail policy calling for a "page-by-page content review" of inmates' confidential outgoing legal mail violated the First and Sixth Amendments of the US Constitution. In reaching this conclusion, the panel applied Nordstrom I standard for Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel, which states: "The right to counsel is violated when 1) 'the government deliberately interferes with the confidential relationship between a criminal defendant and defense counsel' and 2) the interference 'substantially prejudices the criminal defendant.'" The panel concluded: "We have recognized a defendant&#8217;s 'ability to communicate candidly and confidentially' with defense counsel as 'essential to his defense' and 'nearly sacrosanct' ... Thus, prison officials may not read an inmate&#8217;s 'outgoing attorney-client correspondence.'" However, the panel added that prison officials can "inspect" an inmate&#8217;s outgoing mail, in his presence, to ensure that it does not contain such items as a map of the prison yard, details of guards&#8217; shift changes, escape plans, or contraband. As to the First Amendment, the panel applied the four-factor Turner tests which asks:</p>

<blockquote>(1) whether there is "a valid, rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate
governmental interest put forward to justify it"; (2) "whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that
remain open to prison inmates"; (3) what "impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have
on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally"; and (4) whether there is an "absence of ready alternatives."</blockquote>

<p>The panel concluded that the outgoing legal mail policy failed the four-part test, and thus violated the defendant Scott Nordstrom's First Amendment rights "due to the more limited threat that outgoing mail poses to prison security," ADC's inability to make a sufficient showing that such mail poses a threat, and because "there are readily available, less restrictive alternatives" to ADC's policy. The case has been remanded back to the lower court.</p>

<p>Prisoner issues have been prominent across the world. In January, the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a> released figures demonstrating a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/record-number-of-prison-deaths-in-england-and-wales-report.php">record number of suicides and other deaths</a> [JURIST report] in prisons in England and Wales in 2016. Many experts and politicians have attributed the findings to overcrowding and a cut in funding and staffing. Following a clemency order issued by President Pierre Nkurunziza, Burundi's government <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/burund-government-releases-scores-of-prisoners.php">began releasing</a> [JURIST report] scores of prisoner earlier in January. The <a href="https://acluhi.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii</a> (ACLU of Hawaii) [Advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/aclu-of-hawaii-files-complaint-with-doj-over-conditions-in-jails.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in January, stating that overcrowding in the state correctional facilities is resulting in violations of the prisoners' Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The<a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/"> cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> [official site] <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/19/national/politics-diplomacy/cabinet-approves-bill-allow-japans-first-abdication-emperor-200-years/">approved a special bill</a> [Japan Times report] on Friday allowing the reigning <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36983409">Emperor Akihito</a> [BBC profile] to abdicate his throne. This development comes after the 83-year-old emperor hinted at the negative impact the grueling schedule had on his health during a televised remark last year. The current laws preclude the emperor from retiring, thereby preventing a new heir to the throne from assuming the role until after the current emperor dies. The proposed bill not only allows the emperor to retire voluntarily but also names his successor as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Naruhito">Crown Prince Hironomiya Naruhito</a> [Britannica profile]. Notably, this is a one-time abdication provision specifically designed only for Akihito, so as to prevent other monarchs from following suit by taking voluntary retirements. The new bill, to be considered by the Japan Parliament shortly, has created some controversy particularly since it makes no mention of potential female heirs to the throne in the future, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/world/asia/japan-emperor-akihito-retirement-succession.html?_r=1">strong public support for women</a> [NYT report] ascending to the throne. That part of the bill remains unchanged, which would mean that women of royalty who marry would continue to be forced to leave the imperial household. With the passage of this bill, Akihito would become the first emperor since Emperor Kokaku in 1817 to abdicate his throne.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the subject of female accession to the throne in Japan has been raised. More than ten years ago in November 2005, a government panel <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/japan-panel-backs-change-to-succession.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that Japan's succession law should be changed to allow the first-born child, irrespective of gender, the right to ascend to the throne. But late Prince Tomohito, Akihito's cousin, disapproved of changing Japan's "unique tradition and history so easily." The following month the Japanese government <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/japan-preparing-legislation-to-allow.php">set to prepare a legislative proposal</a> [JURIST report] that would have amended the country's the 1947 succession law, the <a href="http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-kunaicho/hourei-01.html">Imperial Household Law</a> [text; The Imperial Household Agency translation from Japanese], to allow female monarchs. In January 2006 then Prime Minister <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Koizumi-Junichiro">Junichiro Koizumi</a> [Britannica profile] <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/japan-pm-to-introduce-bill-allowing.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] by promising to introduce the reform legislation. However, the following month over 1,000 protesters, primarily on the conservative side, gathered in Tokyo to <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japanese-rally-against-female-imperial.php">rally against the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report]. The entire episode came to an abrupt halt ten days later, despite public support for the change, when Koizumi <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japan-pm-scraps-female-royal.php">decided against submitting the bill</a> [JURIST report] to parliament in the face of strong opposition from conservative members of his own party and partly in response to the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japan-pm-slows-support-for-female.php">news of Princess Kiko Kawashima's pregnancy</a> becoming public [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Governor of Texas <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/bio/">Greg Abbott</a> [official profile] is expected in coming days to sign into law <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB100/2017">House Bill 100</a> [materials] which creates a statewide legislation for ride sharing companies, allowing them access back into all Texas markets. The new legislation will allow both <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> [official websites] to enter several markets within the state. The new legislation will allow companies to circumvent local regulations, such as an <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/pio/document.cfm?id=272998">Austin law</a> [memo] requiring fingerprint criminal verification for all drivers for the companies. The bill may also affect Houston regulations that give access to handicapped passengers in the city. An Uber representative said in a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-ridesharing-idUSKBN18H0IJ">statement</a> [Reuters report] that "a statewide framework for ridesharing will help bring greater economic opportunity and expanded access to safe, reliable transportation options to more Texans."</p>

<p>The introduction of ride sharing companies to American markets has led to a variety of responses from state, local and federal legislatures. The dynamics of the new industries has created a shift in major cities all across the United States. To understand the depth of the <a href="/feature/featured/ride-sharing/detail.php">ride sharing industry</a> [JURIST feature], it is important to look at the background, the progression of the industry and its future. Texas is not alone in creating state wide legislation to regulate the industry. In April, the Missouri House passed legislation that <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/missouri-house-approves-statewide-laws-for-ride-sharing.php">standardized</a> [JURIST report] state-wide ride sharing rules. Also in April a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-blocks-seattle-ride-sharing-union-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Seattle's first-in-the-nation law that would allow drivers for taxis, Lyft and Uber to unionize. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Sunday <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2017/05/271009.htm">launched</a> [official statement] a <a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES/0100417Z2NK/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.jpg">short range</a> [RT graphic] missile on Friday creating strain in the reunification efforts with North Korea. The missile launch was the <a href="http://theasianherald.com/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-warns-war-now/">second in a series</a> [Asian Herald report] of test the nation is doing to strengthen their arms capabilities. South Korean President Moon Jae-in <a href="http://english1.president.go.kr/korea/korea.php?srh%5Bview_mode%5D=detail&srh%5Bseq%5D=99">remarked</a> [press release] that the last missile test strained the relation between the parties and called for an emergency session to address the recent missile launch.  The missile test will be brought before the UN on Tuesday to decide <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/un-security-council-to-consult-on-n-korea-missile-diplomats/2017/05/21/815b1d4a-3e4e-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html?utm_term=.62e3ddcb5cbd">how to respond</a>[WAPO report]  to North Korea. </p>

<p>North Koea's pursuit to build up its military continues to draw international response. Back in February Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump, appeared in a joint press conference in Palm Beach, Florida, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/international-community-condemns-north-korea-missile-test.php">strongly condemned</a> [JURIST report] a North Korea ballistic missile test. Moon Jae-in was<a href="/paperchase/2017/05/new-south-korea-president-seeks-international-assistance-against-north-korea-weapons-threat.php"> sworn in as the 19th President of South Korea</a> [JURIST Report] in early May , later that day seeking international assistance on North Korean weapons threats. The North Korean legislature on last <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-sends-letter-to-us-congress-over-sanctions.php">sent a letter </a>[JURIST report] to the US House of Representatives protesting new sanctions  raised against the country.<br />
Cybersecurity researchers on Tuesday said <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/security-researchers-north-korea-possible-source-of-wannacry-cyber-attack.php">they have found evidence </a>[JURIST report] that could link North Korea to the recent cyberattack that affected 300,000 computers in 150 countries over the weekend</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday President Trump <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/posts/10159172888005725">called</a> [official transcript] on the leaders of the Middle East to join in the fight against terrorism. During the speech given to the <a href="https://riyadhsummit2017.org/">Arab Islamic American Summit</a> [official site], international leaders were urged to collectively solve the problems of terrorism by doing their fair share to combat growing violence in their borders. <blockquote>Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith.Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism&#8217;s devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing&#8212;then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God.This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations.</blockquote> The President also announced that the US would be adopting a new strategy of "Principled Realism" in combating terror and would do away with previous strategies that were ineffective. Additionally, he announced the <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0092.aspx">Terrorist Financing Targeting Center</a>[press release] agreement between nations to limit the channels by which terrorist are able to create funding.</p>

<p>The international threat of terrorism is of global concern. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-egypt-security-measures-encouraging-radicalization.php"> said</a> [JURIST report early may that Egypt's recent security measures have been encouraging the very radicalization they were trying to control.UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism  Ben Emmerson <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-expert-saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-policies-threaten-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in May that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights. The UK Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/uk-justice-ministry-to-isolate-extremist-prisoners.php">announced </a>[press release] on Friday plans to separate 28 "dangerous extremist" from the main stream prison population by placing them in one of three separation centers. The UN Security Council in February <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-security-council-condemns-terrorist-attack-in-baghdad.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the February 16 terrorist attack in Baghdad that left at least 55 people de</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan and other Asia-Pacific members of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/tpp-explained-what-is-trans-pacific-partnership.html?_r=0">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) [NYT backgrounder] agreed Sunday to move forward with their deal despite the US' withdrawal. Trade ministers from the 11 remaining countries <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-vietnam-idUSKCN18H02B">met in Hanoi, Vietnam</a> [Reuters report], to plan how to proceed without the US. A possible impediment to continuing the deal is keeping Vietnam and Malaysia on board as one of their motivations for committing was gaining better access to US markets. Trade representatives also <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/39990686">agreed</a> [BBC report] to help the US rejoin the partnership at any time. <a href="https://ustr.gov/">US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-vietnam-lighthizer-idUSKCN18H06D?il=0">said</a> [Reuters report] that the US would not be returning to the TPP but would still engage with the region in bilateral negotiations. The 11 countries that remain in the partnership are Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei</p>

<p>In January, as one of his first moves in office, US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-withdrawing-from-trans-pacific-partnership.php">signed a memorandum</a> [JURIST report] removing the US from the TPP on that grounds that he feared it would have harmed domestic American labor. The move represented a fulfillment of a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/trump-to-withdraw-from-trans-pacific-partnership-on-first-day-in-office.php">campaign promise</a> [JURIST report] for Trump, and a repudiation of one of former president Barack Obama's most ambitious accomplishments, <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-house-passes-compromise-trade-bill.php">first passed in June of 2015</a> [JURIST report]. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/trade-deals-working-all-americans">statement</a> [text] on the official White House website suggests that the president intended to use a threat of similar withdrawal from <a href="https://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/Home/Texts-of-the-Agreement/North-American-Free-Trade-Agreement">NAFTA</a> [official website] to renegotiate the trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Last week Robert Lighthizer <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-confirms-renegotiation-of-nafta.php">sent a letter</a> [text] to Congress communicating the Trump administration's intention to begin the process of renegotiating. However, concerns remain that withdrawing or threatening to do so from such trade deals such like the TPP could ultimately be to the nation's detriment long term; Senator John McCain issued a <a href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=75B5FF88-7343-427C-BC95-E2D4960E8B3B">statement</a> [text] concerning the TPP cancellation, calling it a "serious mistake" that will have "lasting consequences" for America's economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN experts decided to step in after the former governor of Jakarta, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37872151">Basuki "Ahok" Tjahaja Purnama</a> [BBC backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/indonesia-court-convicts-jakarta-governor-of-blasphemy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to two years in prison for blasphemy against Islam, a sentence that was more harsh than what prosecutors sought. His conviction came after Ahok, a Christian, criticized conservative Muslim leaders for using the Quran to prohibit Muslims from voting for a non-Muslim, which Ahok argued was misleading to Muslim voters. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/world/asia/indonesia-governor-ahok-basuki-tjahaja-purnama-blasphemy-islam.html?_r=0">statement</a> [NYT report] was interpreted by some as insulting the Quran. The UN argues that the criminalization of blasphemy is a restriction on freedom of expression, and "disproportionately target persons belonging to religious minorities or traditional religions, non-believers and political dissidents." The experts for the UN argue that laws criminalizing blasphemy justify intolerance and hate speech, which have no place in a democratic society like Indonesia, the UN maintains.</p>

<p><a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=blasphemy&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] have recently been under scrutiny in several countries. In 2008 the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">UK House of Lords</a> [official website] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php">abolish</a> [JURIST report] the criminal offenses of blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the UK common law. In 2010 the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ireland-justice-minister-proposes.php">proposed referendum</a> [JURIST report] to remove the criminal offense of blasphemy from the Irish Constitution. Earlier this year, however, a Sharia high court in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/nigerian-shariah-court-sentences-10-to-death-for-blasphemy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] cleric Abdulaziz Dauda and nine others to death for committing blasphemy against the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. This past February, a Pakistani man was executed for his part in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/pakistan-top-court-upholds-death-sentence-in-blasphemy-killing.php">murdering</a> [JURIST report] a politician who supported a Christian who had been convicted of blasphemy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Switzerland voters back renewable energy plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss voters on Sunday backed the government's plan to provide billions of dollars in subsidies for renewable energy. They also voted by a 58.2 percent majority to ban nuclear power plants and to help bail out struggling utilities, which overturns a November <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/switzerland-votes-to-keep-nuclear-power-options.php">majority vote</a> [JURIST report] rejecting a referendum to phase out the nation's nuclear power program. Switzerland has a system of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-energy-idUSKBN18H0HM">direct democracy</a> [Reuters report], which gives voters the final say in policy issues. The EU's "<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energy-union/2050-energy-strategy">Energy Strategy 2050</a>" [EU background, text] has "a long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95 percent, when compared to 1990 levels, by 2050." Under the proposed law 480 million francs would be put towards funding wind, solar and hydro power. Switzerland's energy output consists of 60 percent hydro, 30 percent nuclear and a mere 5 percent for solar and wind combined. Debates on the proposed laws focused on whether a four-fold increase in solar and wind power would deliver enough energy to replace non-renewable resources. Many were also concerned with how much customers and taxpayers would pay under the proposed changes. Critics of the plan say a family of four would pay an additional 3,200 Swiss francs (USD $3,290) annually and increase the country's reliance on imported energy. </p>

<p>Climate concerns and solutions related to renewable energy resource are still a contested issue. Earlier this month US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-signs-climate-change-declaration.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/other/2017/270802.htm">Fairbanks Declaration</a> [text] to affirm protection of the arctic climate. Also in May the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-votes-to-keep-methane-regulations.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a measure that would rollback methane gas regulations. The Trump administration in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-administration-requests-delay-of-appeals-court-ruling-on-clean-power-plan.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to postpone ruling on the Obama administration's climate change regulations. Also in March US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order reforming the previous administration's energy policies. UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-calls-for-strong-anti-pollution-legislation-and-enforcement.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on global leaders in February to take urgent action on air pollution to ensure world citizens enjoy what the UN calls "the human rights to life and health in environments free from contamination." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court rules North Carolina redistricting unconstitutional</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1262_db8e.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting was unconstitutional. North Carolina officials redrew two congressional districts after the 2010 census, neither of which had a majority black voting-age population, but "both consistently elected the candidates preferred by most African-American voters." To comply with the one-person-one-vote standard, District 1 needed to add nearly 100,000 people. Most of the people added were "from heavily black areas of Durham&#8212;increasing the district's BVAP from 48.6 percent to 52.7 percent." District 12 was also reconfigured, increasing African-American voters from 43.8 percent to 50.7 percent. The court held that the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In a dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito cited a previous state court lawsuit concerning North Carolina's District 12 and argued that the court "junks a rule adopted in a prior, remarkably similar challenge to this very same congressional district." The court held, however, that "North Carolina's victory in a similar state-court lawsuit does not dictate the disposition of this case."</p>

<p>Voting rights and how voters are grouped and counted has become and increasingly important issue over the past year. In January the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit Suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. Earlier that week the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-ordering-special-elections-in-north-carolina.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ruling ordering the redrawing of the congressional district map and special elections to be held in North Carolina. This came after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-two-racial-gerrymandering-cases.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in racial gerymanderings cases from Virginia along with arguments from North Carolina's case. In September several organizations filed a federal lawsuit challenging Georgia's <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/georgia-voter-registration-system-challenged-by-federal-lawsuit.php">voter registration system</a> [JURIST report]. Last April the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced on Sunday that the state of emergency temporarily placed on the country after last year's failed coup would continue until the country reached "welfare and peace." The state of emergency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/21/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-state-of-emergency.html?_r=0">gives</a> [NYT report] Erdoğan and his cabinet nearly unlimited power as it allows them to make policy decisions without parliamentary oversight or review by the constitutional court. International rights groups, such as <a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], have contested the initially justified decree that they now feel is overstepping human rights. Thus far the decrees have permitted the government to jail at least 120 journalist and more than 40,000 people accused of plotting a failed attempt at a second coup. Additionally, more than 140,000 people have been fired or suspended and over 150 news sources have been shut down. In April a law <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkey-blocks-wikipedia-as-threat-to-national-security.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] under the state of emergency blocked access to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> [official website]. </p>

<p>Since the failed coup in Turkey in July, where Turkish military forces tried to overthrow the government, the Turkish government has taken several controversial steps to strengthen its power. Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/tbmm_internet.anasayfa">Turkish Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/turkey-lawmakers-elect-new-judicial-board-members-under-new-constitution.php">elected seven new members</a> [JURIST report] to the country's 13-member Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK) in an overnight vote. Last month, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/turkish-justice-minister-warns-against-challenge-to-referendum-expanding-presidential-powers.php">said</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://constitutionalcourt.gov.tr/">Turkish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] would reject any opposition challenge to the referendum that expanded Erdoğan's powers, and the European Court of Human Rights had no jurisdiction on the matter. In March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-reports-recent-human-rights-violations-in-southern-turkey.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] describing a plethora of human rights violations committed by the Turkish government between July 2015 and December 2016. Also in March around 330 individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/turkish-court-opens-mass-trial-of-coup-suspects.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for alleged involvement in an attempted coup.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human rights situation in Belarus has seen a dramatic deterioration, according to a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/35/40">report</a> [materials] published Monday from Miklos Haraszti, the UN Special Rapporteur on Belarus. The report notes numerous instances of rights abuses, beginning with the suppression of peaceful protests in March over a <a href="http://president.gov.by/uploads/documents/3decree.pdf">law</a> [text, PDF, in Russian] imposing a tax on people who are not employed full time in which more than 900 people were detained. Among those detained in the March protests were political opponents, civil activists, human rights defenders, journalists and foreign observers. This wave of mass arrests was the most severe repression of human rights since the election in 2010. Before the extreme crackdown on peaceful protests, there were reports of political opponents, social activists, and human rights defenders being harassed. The report also highlights that the absence of a free and fair election makes it impossible for real opposition presence in the Belarus Parliament. Additionally, Belarus has resumed its use of capital punishment, executing three people in the past year whose cases were still pending before the Human Rights Committee. Finally, the report acknowledges that has still failed to establish a human rights institution. All of these events have culminated in the deterioration of human rights in Belarus. The report will be presented at the next session of the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>The report by Haraszti highlights the ongoing human rights struggle in Belarus. Perhaps the biggest instance of the deterioration of human rights in Belarus was the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/thousands-gather-in-belarus-to-protest-labor-law.php">suppression</a> [JURIST report] of peaceful protests in March. A UN Special Rapporteur in December <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-strongly-condemns-recent-executions-in-belarus.php">strongly condemned </a> [JURIST report] the executions of three men in Belarus, citing the executions as a confirmation of the "the persistent disregard for human rights in the country." Last May UN human rights experts expressed <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">grave concern</a> [JURIST report] over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee. In August of 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/eu-officials-praise-belarus-for-release-of-political-prisoners.php">EU Officials</a> [JURIST report] Belarus' president for his release of political prisoners. In June 2015 Haraszti <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-advocate-cites-belarus-for-continued-imprisonment-of-opponents.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that Belarus continues to sentence and imprison political opponents of the government. In April 2014 Haraszti called for the country to end its use of the death penalty, reiterating earlier <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/belarus-must-stop-executing-its-citizens-un.php#.U1vQaPldXT8">statements</a> [JURIST report] and citing politically motivated courts and the lack of fair trials. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court: service of process by mail allowed under Hague Service Convention</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-254_5iel.pdf">held unanimously</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/water-splash-inc-v-menon/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/ea_HagueService.pdf">Hague Service Convention</a> [text, PDF] does not prohibit service of process by mail. The purpose of The Hague Service Convention is to simplify, standardize and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad. The court analyzed the text of Article 10(a), which states, "the Convention shall not interfere with the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad." The court saw no reason why the word "send" would exclude the transmission of documents for the service of process. With the scope of the Convention being limited to the service of documents, the court noted that it would not make sense for Article 10(a) to exclude the service of process. Furthermore, the court reasoned that if the drafters of the Convention had wished to limit Article 10(a), they could have done so as they explicitly did in Article 15. Finally, in refuting the argument that service of process should not include mail, the court cited the French version of the convention which uses the word "adresser", a word commonly understood to mean service or notice.</p>

<p>The court had initially heard <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-police-use-of-force-service-abroad.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] for this case on March 23. In this case, Tara Menon worked for Water Splash, a company that makes splash pads for use in parks. During her employment at Water Splash, Menon began using Water Splash designs for a competitor. Water Splash filed suit against Menon in Texas state court, and sought to serve her at her Quebec home by certified mail return receipt requested, first class mail, Federal Express and e-mail, to which Menon did not respond. After Menon failed to respond, the Texas state court granted Water Splash a default judgment, and Menon moved for a new trial alleging improper service because service of process by mail did not comport with the Hague Service Convention. The Texas 14th Court of Appeals found in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16-254-op-below-tex.-app..pdf">Menon's favor</a> [opinion, PDF]. The question for the Supreme Court in this case was whether the Hague Convention's proscription on service by mail is superseded by its preservation of the freedom to send judicial documents by postal channels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN expert on freedom of religion Ahmed Shaheed <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21643&LangID=E">stated</a> [press release] on Monday that Houthi de facto authorities in Yemen must end harassment against the <a href="http://www.bahai.org/">Bahá'í</a> [official website] community in Sana'a. Shaheed's statement was prompted by reports of increased arbitrary arrests and detentions against the Bahá'í community. In addition to demanding Bahá'í community members be released, he also said that Yemen must begin an inquiry into the disappearance of Walid Ayyash and Mahmood Humaid, who were arrested by political authorities in April and whose whereabouts are unknown. Shaheed said "the new wave of court summons and arrest orders appears to be an act of intimidation pressuring the Yemeni Bahá'ís to recant their faith." Such discrimination and harassment against the religious minority threatens the Republic of Yemen's independence and is a violation of Yemeni individuals' rights. </p>

<p>The state of human rights in Yemen is rapidly deteriorating since October, when UN rights expert Heiner Bielefeldt <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-yemen-must-stop-harassment-of-religious-community.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Yemen for detaining individuals belonging to the religious community. In April the Public Prosecutor summoned 30 Bahá'í community members to appear in court and the Houthi de facto authorities ordered the arrest of 25 members. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein reported that more than 13,000 civilians have been killed or wounded in the last two years and more than 80 percent of the population are in need of humanitarian assistance, in his March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-right-chief-calls-for-a-cease-fire-in-yemen.php">statement calling for an immediate ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] in the Yemen war and continued international support in ending the conflict. In February the Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-us-should-investigate-civilian-deaths-in-yemen-raid.php">called on the US</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the January US raid on Al-Qaeda that resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A trial over the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey began at a prison courtroom in Sincan on Monday. Two hundred of the 221 defendants in the case were <a href="http://aa.com.tr/tr/darbe-girisimi-cati-davasi/darbe-planlayicilari-hakim-karsisinda/823222">marched into the courtroom</a> [AA report, in Turkish] before a group of protesters, some of whom threw nooses and demanded the death penalty. Many of the protesters had lost relatives during the coup, which resulted in 240 deaths, primarily civilians. Most of the defendants are former military personnel, with ranks ranging from captains to generals. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-trial-idUSKBN18I10U?il=0">Prosecutors are seeking life sentences</a> [Reuters report] for the defendants' alleged involvement in the coup, where they are accused of "commandeer[ing] tanks, warplanes and helicopters, bombing the parliament and attempting to overthrow the government." US-based Muslim cleric Fetullah Gulen, named as the number one defendant in the case and accused of orchestrating the coup, will be tried in absentia. The trial is scheduled to last until June 16. </p>

<p>The aftermath of the failed coup attempt continues as Turkish President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] that those involved in the coup would "pay a heavy price." On Sunday, Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/erdogan-extends-state-of-emergency-in-turkey.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the state of emergency temporarily placed on the country after the failed coup would continue until the country reached "welfare and peace." In November, Turkey significantly halted the activities of 370 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including human rights and children's groups to investigate the groups' <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkey-significantly-restricts-activities-of-ngos-and-rights-organizations.php">alleged terror connections</a> [JURIST report]. The president of the UN Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, Theodor Meron, <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-demands-turkey-release-international-judge.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] the release of Turkish judge Aydin Sefa Akay in an address to the UN General Assembly. Earlier that month, the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/turkish-government-arrests-opposition-party-leaders.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] eight pro-Kurdish political party members, including the party's two leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag and an additional nine party members. In September, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said that approximately 32,000 people <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/turkish-official-more-than-32000-arrested-in-connection-with-coup-attempt.php">have been arrested</a> [JURIST report] and 70,000 have been questioned. In late October, Turkey's government <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/turkey-government-dismisses-10000-civil-servants-and-closes-15-media-outlets.php">dismissed 10,000 additional civil servants</a> [JURIST report] and closed 15 more media outlets for their supposed connection with US-based religious leader Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey has accused of orchestrating the attempted coup in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/en/">Texas Civil Rights Project</a> (TCRP) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="https://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-main.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Monday to challenge a recently passed <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [text, PDF] that they claim unlawfully targets immigrants. One provision of Senate Bill 4 (SB4) permits authorities to demand immigration or citizenship status from any individual suspected to be an undocumented person in an attempt to eliminate sanctuary cities. TCRP argues that this "show me your papers" law promotes racial and ethnic profiling and is unconstitutional. SB4 also criminally punishes state and local authorities that fail to enforce the provisions to a high degree and allows the Texas government to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/texas-state-house-approves-ban-on-sanctuary-cities.php">withhold funding</a> [JURIST report] from local governments acting as "sanctuary cities." <a href="http://americasvoice.org/">America's Voice</a> [official website] <a href="http://americasvoice.org/press_releases/texas-show-me-your-papers/">reported</a> [AV report] that enforcement authorities have been strong advocates against the law because the provisions will be counterproductive to ensuring public safety. One concern is that undocumented persons will not speak up against violence or cooperate as witnesses of crimes, in fear that they will be fined, detained, or deported. Texas Governor <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/">Greg Abbott</a> [official website] defended the bill <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/07/texas-senate-tentatively-approves-anti-sanctuary-city-legislation/">stating</a> [<em>Texas Tribune</em> report], "this bill ensures that there is predictability that our laws are applied without prejudice." </p>

<p>Since the election of US President Donald Trump, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">continue to stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In March the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mississippi-senate-approves-bill-to-prohibit-local-sanctuary-immigration-policies.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. In February, the Alabama House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. Earlier in February San Francisco filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding</a> [JURIST report] from sanctuary cities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Gambian court issued an order to freeze former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24383225">Yahya Jammeh's</a> [BBC profile] remaining assets on Monday. Justice Minister Abubacarr Tambadou <a href="http://fatunetwork.net/full-statement-delivered-justice-minister-tambadou-freezing-jammehs-assets/">said</a> [Fatu Network, press release] that the order was "necessitated after the discovery of unlawful withdrawals" between 2006 and 2016 that possibly totaled $50 million. The order affects 131 properties, 88 bank accounts, 14 companies associated with the former president as well as a number of his livestock. Three of Jammeh's cousins were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40003643">arrested</a> [BBC report] after selling his cattle. After 22 years in power Jammeh fled to Equitorial New Guinea when he lost the presidency to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38185428">Adama Barrow</a> [BBC profile]. Various luxury items, including cars, were loaded onto the cargo plane Jammeh used to leave the country. He has not been available for comment since leaving Gambia.</p>

<p>Shortly after his inauguration, Barrow promised to end human rights violations and <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/gambia-presdient-releases-171-inmates-held-without-trial.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of 171 inmates that who had been detained without trial. Barrow also recently announced that <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/gambia-president-country-will-remain-in-icc.php">will stay in</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], whose primary purpose is "trying individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity." Barrow's predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, had said that The Gambia would leave the ICC. Barrow's election results were hotly contested by Jammeh, who <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/gambia-president-files-injunction-to-bar-swearing-in-of-president-elect.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit seeking an injunction barring Barrow's inauguration in January. Jammeh also <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/gambia-president-to-challenge-election-results-before-supreme-court.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] the election results in January before Gambia's Supreme Court, but the court delayed hearing the suit until May. In another attempt to hold power, Jammeh <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/gambia-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a state of emergency in January, a month after Barrow won the presidential election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/news/human-rights-women-children-adolescents/en/">High-Level Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children and Adolescents</a> [WHO statement] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/Health/ReportHLWG-humanrights-health.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday imploring world leaders to allocate 5 percent of their country's GDP in "public health spending," <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21645&LangID=E">according</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website]. Tarja Halonen, former president of Finland and co-chair of the High-Level Group, said "human rights ... to health" must be recognized and protected in order to achieve the goals established in the <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">2030 Sustainable Development Agenda</a> [materials]. The report outlines nine recommendations falling under three main categories; "creating an enabling environment," "partner[ing] with people," and "strengthen[ing] evidence and public accountability." The report, which is addressed to the <a href="http://www.who.int/dg/en/">Director General of the World Health Organization</a> [official website], states: "We know what needs doing, and how to do it. We know why we should do it. We also know it makes financial sense. What we need is more concrete and sustained political commitment and leadership." The report will be <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session35/Pages/ListReports.aspx">presented</a> [materials] to the Human Rights Council on June 13. </p>

<p>Female access to equitable healthcare services has been a contentious and evolving battle throughout the world, especially with regards to reproductive and sexual health. Last June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health. The report refers to the "instrumentalization" of women in the healthcare system, in particular the "subjection of women's natural biological functions to a politicized patriarchal agenda." Earlier that month independent experts for the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">found</a> [JURIST report] a woman faced "inhumane treatment" while seeking an abortion procedure in Northern Ireland. In the press release, the experts called upon countries to more effectively balance the rights of the fetus with the rights of the woman, viewing her as more than just a mechanism for child-bearing. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-elimination-of-female-genital-mutilation-by-2030.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all countries to eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas' Republican-controlled Senate gave final approval to a bill that would enable publicly funded foster care and adoption agencies to refuse the placement of children with non-Christian, unmarried or gay prospective parents due to religious objections. The <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/HB03859I.pdf">"Freedom to Serve Children Act"</a> [text, PDF] was passed early Monday and will now go to <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website] for his consideration. <a href="http://www.senate.texas.gov/member.php?d=28">Senator Charles Perry of Lubbock</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/texas-adoption-agency-religious-refusal-closer-to-law/2017/05/21/668d356c-3e98-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html?utm_term=.1ff04bfdafbe">said</a> [AP report] that the bill does not prohibit particular groups from adopting. In contrast, critics of the measure have called the bill a form of state-funded discrimination. The bill is opposed by various LGBT rights groups and the <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Texas</a> [advocacy website]. </p>

<p>The rights of same-sex couples remains an ongoing issue after the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/obergefell-v-hodges/">Obergefell decision</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-orders-south-carolina-to-list-both-same-sex-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] South Carolina to list both same-sex parents on a child's birth certificate. In December the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/arkansas-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-birth-certificate-law.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows only the biological parents to be placed on the birth certificate, finding that equal protection was not violated by "acknowledging basic biological truths." In August New York's top court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/new-york-top-court-expands-definition-of-parent.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the definition of "parent" to better accommodate same-sex couples. Last May the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-supreme-court-vacates-ruling-refusing-to-recognize-same-sex-adoption.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption from other states. Last April a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN panel releases draft treaty banning nuclear weapons</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN panel released a <a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/05/22/BanDraft.pdf">draft treaty</a> [text, PDF] in Geneva on Monday that would ban the use of all nuclear weapons. States that are party to the treaty are obligated never to develop, produce, manufacture, acquire or use "any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion." The draft is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/un-panel-releases-draft-treaty-banning-possession-and-use-of-nuclear-weapons">supported</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] by more than 130 non-nuclear states, although none of the countries that are known to posses nuclear arms participated. Nine countries are believed to be in possession of nuclear arms: UK, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea and the US. Those countries that have nuclear arms would rather refocus efforts into strengthening the <a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text">Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</a> [treaty, text]. Critics of the treaty say the efficacy of the ban is determined by the involvement of those states currently in possession of nuclear arms. </p>

<p>Tensions continue to rise throughout the international community in regards to the North Korean actions seeking to <a href="/hotline/2017/05/James-Rudolph-north-korea-nukes.php">obtain functional nuclear missile</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Early this week North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/north-korea-missile-test-strains-unification-measures.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] a short range missile, creating strain in the reunification efforts with South Korea. The same day Moon Jae-in was sworn in as the nineteenth president of South Korea he <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/new-south-korea-president-seeks-international-assistance-against-north-korea-weapons-threat.php">sought international assistance</a> [JURIST report] with North Korean weapons threats. Back in February Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US President Donald Trump appeared in a joint press conference in Palm Beach, Florida, strongly <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/international-community-condemns-north-korea-missile-test.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] a North Korean ballistic missile test. In January North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/north-korea-declares-it-will-test-intercontinental-ballistic-missile.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would attempt intercontinental ballistic missile test, furthering its effort to show strength to the world. It has been well documented throughout the world that these tests will be denounced by many prominent nations. With some mulling the idea of possible military intervention on the Korean peninsula, the more common rhetoric has been that increased sanctions on the country will force it to comply with the international communities wishes. That is what the US did in January, when it choose to increase <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-expands-sanctions-on-north-korea-for-human-rights-violations.php">sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on North Korea in regards to the countries violations of human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a six-month <a href="https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nokia.apple_.complaint.pdf">legal dispute</a> [text, PDF] over the right to use patents and other intellectual property, <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin">Apple</a> and <a href="http://www.nokia.com/en_int">Nokia </a> [corporate websites] reached a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/05/nokia-and-apple-sign-agreement-settle-all-litigation/">settlement</a> [press release] Tuesday that covers all ends of the lawsuits filed. The suit came as a result of Apple stating that they would no longer pay to use Nokia's patents, many of which are built into Apple's miscellany of products. Apple claims that the Finnish telecommunications company is guilty of extortion while Nokia is adamant in defending their intellectual property. Nokia's former chief executive, Stephan Elop, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/14/apple-nokia-patent-case">said</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the settlement "enables us to focus on further licensing opportunities in the mobile communications market."</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Apple has been involved in a patent dispute. In December there was an installment concerning an <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php#.U2TvNa1dXG4">ongoing patent dispute</a> [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants Apple and Samsung. In July Apple filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/apple-urges-supreme-court-to-rule-against-samsung.php">brief</a> [JURIST report] asking the Supreme Court to rule against Samsung in its patent infringement lawsuit. In January the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/california-district-court-grants-apple-permanent-injunction-against-samsung.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] Apple's motion for a permanent injunction against Samsung for infringing upon three software patents. In August 2014 the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-denies-apple-request-for-ban-on-samsung-phones-and-tablets.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August 2014 Apple and Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/apple-samsung-agree-to-dismiss-international-patent-disputes.php">agreed to drop</a> [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/indigo_williams_et_al_v_phil_bryant_et_al_complaint.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Tuesday alleging that Mississippi is failing to uphold its obligations under a federal law that enabled it to rejoin the union after the Civil War. The law required the state to create a "uniform education system of free public schools" that would serve all children, regardless of race and that no amendment could be made to the state's constitution that would undermine the requirement. Despite this, the constitution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/black-parents-use-civil-war-era-law-to-challenge-mississippis-inequitable-system-of-public-schools/2017/05/23/4a055a14-3f4c-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?utm_term=.7782b9a2848b">has been amended four times</a> [WP report] including the addition of a provision that allowed for "separate but equal" schools that allocated mored funding for schools attended by white children. The current suit was <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/05/23/splc-suit-mississippi-violates-binding-obligation-provide-%E2%80%98uniform%E2%80%99-system-public-education">filed on behalf</a> [SPLC press release] of four African-American mothers whose children attend Jackson Public School District and the Yazoo City Municipal School District, districts that have been given an "F" rating from the Mississippi Department of  Education. 13 of the state's 19 school districts that receive an "F" rating are more than 95 percent African-American. The schools "lack textbooks, literature, basic supplies, experienced teachers, sports and other extracurricular activities, tutoring programs, and even toilet paper." Schools in neighboring areas that are mostly white and have access to a broad range of resources have much higher proficiency ratings in both math and reading. </p>

<p>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. In March the Kansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/kansas-top-court-rules-state-failed-to-ensure-adequate-education-funding.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state failed to ensure sufficient funding for public schools. In February the Illinois State Board of Education <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/illinois-board-of-education-settles-2008-funding-lawsuit.php">voted to approve</a> [JURIST report] a settlement of a lawsuit claiming discriminatory school funding. In September the Supreme Court of Nevada <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/nevada-top-court-rules-school-funding-system-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's school funding system was unconstitutional. Earlier that month the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that Governor Matt Bevin did not have the authority to unilaterally <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kentucky-top-court-rules-governor-cannot-cut-state-university-budgets.php">cut the budget</a> [JURIST report] for state universities. In 2015 the Supreme Court of Washington <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. Also in August of that year the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Korea's impeached president denied all charges and pleaded not guilty on Tuesday in her first court appearance at <a href="http://eng.scourt.go.kr/eng/judiciary/organization/courts3.jsp">Seoul Central District Court</a> [official website]. Former conservative party leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20787271">Park Guen-hye</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/world/asia/park-geun-hye-south-korea-trial.html">indicted</a> [NYT report] on 18 charges including accepting $52 million in bribes from large corporations such as <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [official website]. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/former-south-korean-president-park-geun-hye-on-trial-for-corruption">scandal</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] has led to the indictments of former business leaders, former cabinet ministers and senior presidential aides. Park has been living in a solitary cell since her arrest on March 31. Two preliminary hearings were already held in front of a three-judge panel without Park's presence. Park faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery. Her liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, has the power to pardon her sentence. The next day of hearings is scheduled for Thursday. </p>

<p>This is the latest development in a scandal that has grown to encompass numerous South Korean political and corporate leaders. Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/former-south-korea-president-indicted.php">indicted</a> [JURIST] in April along with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/shin-dong-bin/">Shin Dong-bin</a> [Forbes profile], chairman of the <a href="https://www.lotte.co.kr/eng/index.jsp">Lotte Group</a> [official website], on similar bribery charges. Earlier in April South Korea's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/high-court-upholds-impeachment-of-south-korean-president.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] parliament's decision to impeach Park over a scandal related to government bribes paid by Samsung. South Korean lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/south-korea-lawmakers-vote-to-impeach-president-park-geun-hye.php">voted 234-56 to impeach</a> [JURIST report] Park in December. In February Samsung's would-be head Lee was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/samsung-head-arrested-for-corruption-scandal-involving-south-korea-president.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery and undue influence in connection with the scandal. Five Samsung executives <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/samsung-executives-deny-bribery-charges.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] of bribery, embezzlement and corruption that were leveled against them in connection with Park. Two weeks ago the Seoul Central District Court said that it <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/south-korea-court-reassigns-samsung-case-to-new-judge.php">reassigned Lee's bribery case</a> [JURIST report] to a new judge, after reports surfaced the same week concerning the previous judge's connection to a woman Lee is accused of bribing. In February South Korea's special prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/south-korea-indicts-former-culture-minister-top-aide-for-abuse-of-power.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] former culture minister <a href="http://www.mcst.go.kr/english/ministry/minister/profile.jsp">Yoon-sun Cho</a> [official profile] and former presidential chief of staff Ki-choon Kim on charges of coercion, abuse of power and perjury connected to creation of a blacklist of opposition artists critical to Park. Park was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/former-south-korea-president-arrested.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of bribery, coercion, abuse of power, and leaking government secrets on March 31.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-341_8n59.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tc-heartland-llc-v-kraft-foods-group-brands-llc/">TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on what constitutes "residence" in the context of patent cases. The issue before the court was whether 28 USC § 1400(b) is the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in patent infringement actions and is not to be supplemented by 28 USC § 1391(c). The case centered around a previous Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11017090587647439652&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp</a> [text], where the court held that § 1400(b) is not to be supplemented by § 1391(c), and that as applied to corporate entities, the phrase "where the defendant resides" in § 1400(b) "mean[s] the state of incorporation only." The court held that residence refers only to the state of incorporation, which limits where suit can be filed. The patent venue statute, 28 USC § 1400(b), provides that "[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business."</p>

<p>The court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/16-341_8njq.pdf">heard arguments</a> [transcript] on the case this past March, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments.php">where petitioner argued</a> [JURIST report] that the patent venue statute, 28 USC §1400(b), has a statutory phrase on which the court previously ruled. In that case, Petitioner argued that the court found that the venue "means the state of incorporation only" and is "not to be supplemented by the provisions of 28 USC §1391(c). Petitioner therefore argued that the current interpretation by the court in <span class="casename">Fourco Glass</span> should be maintained as it preserves the original meaning of the statues and supports the court's canon of statutory construction. Respondent in turn argued that §1391(c) applies for all venue purposes including §1400(b) and the Venue Clarification Act is more recent than <span class="casename">Fourco Glass</span> and therefore should not be ignored. Therefore, respondent argued that Congress' definition of "residence" expands on venue more than just a place of incorporation and should be used for the purposes of patent litigation under §1391(c). </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] granted <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/17grantednotedlist.pdf">certiorari</a> [order, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sas-institute-inc-v-lee/">SAS Institute Inc. v. Lee</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on whether third parties can petition the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) [official website] to re-review issued claims and, if not patentable, cancel them. The question now is whether the re-review law requires the USPTO to issue written decisions regarding all the challenged claims, or only some of them. The issue before the court is:<blockquote>Whether 35 USC § 318(a), which provides that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in an inter partes review "shall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner," requires that Board to issue a final written decision as to every claim challenged by the petitioner, or whether it allows that Board to issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of only some of the patent claims challenged by the petitioner, as the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held.</blockquote><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-969-cert-petition.pdf">Petitioner claims</a> [cert. petition, PDF] that the statute in question is written in plain English, and should be interpreted in the manner in which the words mean in common conversation. The relevant statutory provision is, "If an inter partes review is instituted and not dismissed under this chapter, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall issue a final written decision with respect to the patentability of any patent claim challenged by the petitioner."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/152560.P.pdf">allowed a lawsuit</a> [text, PDF] by <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia</a> [website] to proceed against the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website]. The suit claims that the NSA's use of Upstream violates the First and Fourth Amendments. Upstream is a surveillance program authorized under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-36">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [materials]. In 2015 Wikimedia challenged the government's use of Upstream as it stored and reviewed some communications by Wikimedia. The appeals court vacated and remanded an earlier decision denying the suit on the basis of standing. The court held Wikimedia could move forward in its Upstream claim but not in its Dragnet claim, which was broader and alleged that the NSA stored and reviewed substantially all communications entering and exiting the US.</p>

<p>In 2015 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-surveillance.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/93._d._md._opinion_10.23.2015.pdf">lawsuit </a>[text, PDF] filed by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and other human rights organizations challenging surveillance by the NSA. Judge TS Ellis III granted the government's motion to dismiss, finding, "any alleged burdensome measures taken [by plaintiffs] as a result of subjective fear of surveillance are not fairly traceable to Upstream surveillance" and that common law precedent dictates that "a threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact and that allegations of possible future injury are not sufficient" for relief. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13559597">Ratko Mladić</a> [BBC profile], a former Bosnian Serb commander, has filed a challenge to a UN court's rejection of his request to be sent to Russia, according to <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/presord/en/170523.pdf">court documents</a> [text, PDF] released Tuesday. Mladić is seeking medical attention, as he has alleged that the care he receives at The Hague is inadequate. The Hague refutes these claims and fears, that if released, Mladić would not return. Mladić was indicted on two counts of genocide in 1995. He was not arrested until 2011. Closing arguments in Mladić's trial were made in December 2016.</p>

<p>In December prosecutors in Mladić's war crimes trial <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-prosecutors-urge-life-sentence-for-ratko-mladic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the judges to impose a life sentence. The trial commenced on May 16, 2012, before the <a href="http://www.icty.org/en">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. Mladić is commonly referred to as the "Butcher of Bosnia" for the various war crimes he allegedly committed during the Bosnian conflict from 1992-1995, including <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">genocide and crimes against humanity</a> [ICTY case sheet, PDF]. The charges against Mladić allege that he was responsible for the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18101028">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder] as well as a Serb sniping and mortar campaign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/Legislator/A/Senate/">Nevada Senate</a> [official website] voted 11-10 on Tuesday to approve a <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB261_R1.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would allow terminally ill patients the option to end their life. The bill would allow, but does not require, doctors to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/23/right-to-die-bill-moves-forward-nevada-legislature/340687001/">prescribe</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] pharmaceuticals intended to end the patient's life. In order to be found competent, two doctors must diagnose the patient with a terminal illness and the patient must be at least 18 years of age. Those who voted in favor of the bill have stated that the primary purpose of the bill was to give terminally-ill patients personal control over receiving life-ending treatment. If the bill becomes law, Nevada would become the seventh state in the country to legalize the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">"right-to-die"</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>

<p>The right to die has a tumultuous history around the would. In 2013, the Supreme Court of Ireland rejected an <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-high-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-has-no-right-to-assisted-suicide.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a paralyzed woman seeking to allow her partner to help her commit suicide. Although Ireland decriminalized suicide in 1993, it is still a crime to assist another to commit suicide. In 2015, guest columnist Kathryn L. Tucker of End of Life Liberty Project explained the 2015 <a href="/hotline/2015/10/margaret-dore-physician-assisted-suicide.php">California legislation</a> [JURIST op-ed], which has allowed for options to help patients who wish to achieve a peaceful death. In 2016 the <a href="http://dccouncil.us/">District of Columbia Council </a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://lims.dccouncil.us/Download/33261/B21-0038-Introduction.pdf">"Death with Dignity" bill</a> [text, PDF] that would allow terminally ill patients to end their own lives with a physician's help. In February of this year, Montana introduced <a href="http://leg.mt.gov/bills/2017/billpdf/HB0536.pdf">HB 536</a> [text, PDF], which would allow homicide charges to be brought against doctors engaged in physician-assisted suicide and would run against the current policy that allows life-ending options. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwan's constitutional court, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/en/p01_03.asp">Judicial Yuan</a> [official website], declared on Wednesday that same-sex marriages will be legally recognized. The court has given two years for the legislature to make amendments allowing same-sex marriage, and a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/05/taiwan-same-sex-marriage-landmark-ruling/">draft of the bill</a> [AI news] is currently being considered. Under the new legislation, same-sex couples will have the same rights as opposite-sex couples. The ruling is a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt-marriage-idUSKBN18K0UN">first in Asia</a> [Reuters report], a mostly socially conservative area, but Taiwan has a reputation of being on the progressive forefront for the region. In the last year, the <a href="http://www.dpp.org.tw/">Democratic Progressive Party</a> [party website, in Chinese] swept the national elections on the self-ruled island. Taiwan has a large gay community and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/asia/taiwan-same-sex-marriage/">holds</a> [CNN report] the biggest gay pride celebration in Asia annually. The country's first female president, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16464515">Tsai Ing-wen</a> [BBC profile], expressed support for the LGBT community during her campaign in 2016. </p>

<p>Despite the increase in <a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/AUSTRALIA-POLITICS-GAYMARRIAGE/0100300Y01Z/SAMESEX-MARRIAGE.jpg">countries ruling in favor of same-sex marriage</a> [Reuters map], many are still prosecuted around the world for engaging in homosexual relationships. Last month Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the <a href="http://www.placng.org/new/laws/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20%28Prohibition%29%20Act,%202013.pdf">Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act</a> [text]. Earlier last month Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter about 100 gay and bisexual men have been detained, went missing, were tortured, or were murdered under the authority of Chechen officials. Also in April A UK high court stayed the <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/uk-court-stays-citizens-extradition-to-turkey-based-on-safety-concerns.php">extradition</a> [JURIST report] of a gay British man, Rosslee Charles, to Turkey given concerns over his safety. In March Germany Justice Minister <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/FederalGovernment/Cabinet/HeikoMaas/_node.html">Heiko Maas</a> [official profile] announced that the country's cabinet has <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/germany-cabinet-approves-measure-to-compensate-men-convicted-under-anti-gay-law.php">approved a measure</a> [JURIST report] to pardon and provide compensation to approximately 50,000 men convicted under a Nazi-era law against homosexuality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/">Texas Senate</a> [official website] revived a full "bathroom bill" early Wednesday morning. In <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/texas-senate-rejecting-houses-watered-bathroom-bill-47600225">1AM vote</a> [AP report], the Senate voted 21-10 to attach restroom regulations to an otherwise unrelated proposal concerning county governments. The piggy-backing rules will require transgender Texans to use public restrooms that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificates. The original bill was written by a democrat who will not accept the changes. On Sunday the House <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/texas-house-passes-bathroom-bill-targeting-transgender-schoolchildren/2017/05/22/b828efce-3f15-11e7-8c25-44d09ff5a4a8_story.html?utm_term=.1f6c56695f39">approved a similar bill</a> [WP report] that only applied to schoolchildren, but the author is rejecting those rules as "too watered-down." The Texas legislature must reach a compromise on the bills before their session ends on Monday.</p>

<p>The Texas legislature has been attempting to pass regulations on <a href="/forum/2017/04/Dara-Purvis-texas-bathroom-bill.php">transgender bathroom rights</a> [JURIST op-ed] for several months. In March the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/texas-senate-approves-bathroom-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/SB00006I.htm">Texas Privacy Act</a> [SB 6], which would require people to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender listed on their birth certificate, but the bill stalled in the House. Earlier in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-sends-transgender-bathroom-case-back-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling in a case concerning transgender restroom policies following a move by the Trump administration to rescind guidelines that school districts should allow students to use the bathroom of their choice. Also in March, 11 states, led by Texas, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/states-withdraw-lawsuit-over-transgender-bathroom-executive-order-after-trump-repeals.php">filed a document</a> [JURIST report] in federal court to withdraw a lawsuit against the US government, a week after a "Dear Colleague letter" from the Department of Justice overturned Obama-era guidance regarding bathroom use by transgender students. Other states have been battling access to public restrooms as well. In April the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina concerning a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 in March with the passage of House Bill 142. Last May former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST reports] from the lawsuit in September. In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District Court of California</a> [official website] agreed Tuesday to reconsider his <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/filelibrary/3043/Order-Granting-Motions-to-Enjoin-9-a-of-Exec-O.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] blocking President Donald Trump's executive order that cuts funding from so-called "sanctuary cities." In his opinion, San Fransisco-based <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who">Judge William Orrick</a> [official website] stated, "Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration-enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves." Orrick accepted a request from the Trump administration after <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [website] <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3728675/Implementation-of-Executive-Order-13768.pdf">issued a memo</a> [text, PDF] that outlined how sanctuary cities could lose their funding. Only cities that "willfully refuse to comply with <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1373">8 U.S.C. 1373</a> [LII materials]" will lose financial support from the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official websites], according to the memo. The Justice Department, which issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/page/file/968406/download">proposed budget</a> [text, PDF] that seeks to require law enforcement to comply with federal immigration detainers, argued that Orrick's reasoning no longer applies and that his judgment should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>Since the election of Trump, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while some cities continue to <a href="forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">stand behind their policies</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/en/">Texas Civil Rights Project</a> (TCRP) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/civil-rights-group-files-lawsuit-against-texas-anti-immigration-bill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to challenge a recently passed bill, <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">SB4</a> [text, PDF], that they claim unlawfully targets immigrants and defunds sanctuary cities. In April the <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">Texas House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved SB4. In March the Mississippi Senate <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. In February, the Alabama House <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-to-block-funding-for-sanctuary-universities.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to block funding for sanctuary universities. Earlier in February San Francisco filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration over an executive order that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">cut federal funding</a> [JURIST report] from sanctuary cities. In January, the New York Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/new-york-ag-proposes-model-language-for-laws-and-policies-regarding-immigration.php">proposed model language</a> [JURIST report] for immigration laws and policies in sanctuary cities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippine <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36659258">President Rodrigo Duterte</a> [BBC profile] declared martial law on the island of Mindanao on Tuesday when heavily armed militants linked to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> [BBC profile] took over large parts of Marawi City, a provincial capital in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Violence erupted after the government <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/duterte-declares-martial-law-on-southern-philippine-island-of-mindanao/2017/05/23/cf77fcae-3fd0-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?utm_term=.7b8781f7987d">attempted to capture</a> [WP report] Isnilon Hapilon, the leader of the Muate, a militant group that aligns with the Islamic State. The militants <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-militants-idUSKBN18K08M">have been</a> [Reuters report] capturing Christians, setting prisoners free, and seizing and torching buildings. The measures under martial law will apply the entire island, affecting nearly 21 million people, and will include curfews, the establishment of checkpoints and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The martial law declaration has raised suspicions as to whether Duterte has other motivations, as he has raised the prospect of martial law several times in connection with his deadly attempt to suppress drug sales in the Philippines. Duterte, who was scheduled to meet with Russian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17839882">President Vladi­mir Putin</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-15047827">Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</a> [BBC profiles], has cut his trip to Moscow short to return to Manila to address the current crisis. </p>

<p>More than 8,000 people have reportedly been killed over drug-related offenses since Duterte took office last year. Numerous rights groups have been critical of the killings and have spoken out against the current administration. Early in March <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report that accused the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December a UN Human rights chief called for a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] after Duterte admitted to killing people in his role as mayor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three UN experts on cultural rights, extreme poverty and adequate housing <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21657&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN news] the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to stop the demolition of a 400-year-old neighborhood in Awamia on Wednesday. According to <a href="http://www.adhrb.org/2017/04/adhrb-un-experts-urge-saudi-halt-planned-demolition-historic-awamiyah-neighborhood/">Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain</a> [report] the historic quarter of Awamia, al-Masora, has a significant cultural history. The walled city holds mosques, markets and businesses and is home to about 2,000 to 3,000 people. The Saudi government is planning to demolish the historic architecture and replace it with commercial and service areas. The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing warns that what is happening constitutes as forced eviction which is a violation of human rights. Those who are ousted are forced to relocate or are left homeless as the government is not supplying housing alternatives. Many have lost possessions as well as their livelihoods in the destruction. The experts concluded by demanding an immediate halt on the demolition.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has drawn international criticism for perceived human rights abuses in recent years. Earlier this month UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Ben Emmerson, <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-expert-saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-policies-threaten-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights. In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/saudi-arabia-intensifies-actions-against-human-rights-advocates-and-writers.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Saudi Arabia was intensifying actions against human rights advocates and writers. In January 2015 a Saudi judge sentenced prominent human rights lawyer Walid Abu al-Khair to an <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/saudi-arabia-increases-prison-sentence-for-human-rights-lawyer.php">additional five years in jail</a> [JURIST report] after he refused to show remorse for "showing disrespect" to authorities and creating an unauthorized association. In October 2014 a Saudi Arabia Court sentenced three lawyers to between five and eight years in prison for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-3-lawyers-for-criticizing-judiciary.php">criticizing the justice system</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter by accusing authorities of carrying out arbitrary detentions. Earlier that month Amnesty International issued a report claiming that Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/rights-group-condemns-saudi-arabia-persecution-of-activists.php">persecutes rights activists and silences government critics</a> [JURIST report], especially in the years since the Arab Spring in 2011. In July 2014 then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navy Pillay, <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-arrests-of-saudi-arabia-activists.php">expressed deep concern</a> [JURIST report] over the harsh sentences and detention of peaceful human rights advocates in Saudi Arabia in recent months. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov">Governor Phil Scott</a> [official website] vetoed a <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2018/Docs/JOURNAL/hj170510.pdf#page=17">bill</a> [text] on Wednesday that would have made Vermont the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana and the first to do so via a <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2018/S.22">legislative body</a> [materials]. Scott sent the bill back to lawmakers with suggestions for more aggressive penalties for using marijuana while driving or in the presence of children. Despite the veto, Scott has indicated that he is willing to work with the <a href="http://legislature.vermont.gov">legislature</a> [official website] on a compromise and noted the "clear societal shift" towards legalization. According to the governor's communications director, <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/press-release/governor-elect-scott-announces-two-agency-heads-additional-staff">Rebecca Kelly</a> [official website], the biggest point the governor wants to cover is clearly establishing "how impaired is too impaired." Unfortunately, however, police do not yet have a reliable toxicology test that can say for sure if someone is to high to drive in the same way that a breathalyzer or blood test can show if someone is too drunk. Despite recreational marijuana currently being illegal in Vermont, the state is still considered to have among the the highest prevalence of marijuana use across all age groups, as reported by the <a href="http://www.healthvermont.gov">Vermont Department of Health</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Marijuana legalization measures are becoming a global priority. The Mexican Chamber of Deputies <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/mexico-legislature-approves-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in April allowing the use, production and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. Also in April Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-legalizing-medicinal-marijuana-extract.php">signed Senate Bill 10</a> [JURIST report], legalizing the medicinal use of a marijuana extract, into law. An anonymous Canadian government official in March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/canada-may-legalize-recreational-marijuana-by-july-2018.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the country's intention to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018. The lower house of the Dutch parliament in February <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dutch-lower-house-approves-bill-allowing-cultivation-of-cannabis.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 77-72 to approve a bill [text, in Dutch] that would tolerate the cultivation of cannabis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iraq's <a href="http://www.moi.gov.iq/">Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in Arabic] has launched an investigation into human rights violations carried out against civilians by special forces while fighting the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> (IS) [BBC profile] in Mosul. The allegations were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iraq-probes-allegations-of-human-rights-violations-in-mosul/2017/05/24/15ac907e-4060-11e7-b29f-f40ffced2ddb_story.html?utm_term=.f2bff060e543">initially reported</a> [AP report] by Ali Arkady, an Iraqi photographer with <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/">Der Spiegel Magazine</a> [official website, in German] who accompanied the Interior Ministry's special forces team, the Emergency Response Division (ERD), a unit closely backed by a US coalition. While carrying out operations against IS, Arkady said he witnessed the killing, torture and rape of suspects. Arkady's piece <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/389614-torture-rape-executions-iraq-mosul/">featured</a> [RT report] photos of torture scenes that included people hanging from ceilings with their arms tied behind their backs. After being abused for days, ERD commanders would execute the detainees with a technique Arkady says the unit's personnel learned from US instructors during military training. Brig. Gen Saad Maan, the Interior Ministry's spokesman, said "legal measures will be applied ... against wrongdoers."</p>

<p>Iraqi civilians continue to be victimized by the forces fighting in Iraq. in March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-chief-deplores-recent-civilian-deaths-in-mosul.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the recent loss of civilian life in Mosul as a result of airstrikes and actions by IS militants. The UN reported in January that 19,266 Iraqi civilian casualties <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-more-than-6800-iraq-civilians-killed-in-2016.php">occurred in 2016 alone</a> [JURIST report], with 6,878 killed and 12,388 wounded. Since 2014 IS has reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/report-islamic-state-used-chemical-weapons-at-least-52-times-in-iraq-syria.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] over 19 chemical attacks against Mosul. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called for immediate <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/call-to-action-over-isis-victims-rights--un-commissioner-for-human-rights.php">action</a> [JURIST report] for IS victims to ensure that their rights are being upheld in Iraq. That month, Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/amnesty-iraq-police-forces-tortured-and-killed-villagers-near-mosul.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Iraqi police forces of torturing and unlawfully killing villagers near Mosul during last year's offensive in the city. In October AI accused Iraqi government forces of <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/amnesty-iraq-government-paramilitary-forces-committing-rights-abuses-war-crimes.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], citing them as possible revenge killings. In September the UN reported that two-thirds of those injured or killed the prior month were <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-civilians-bearing-brunt-of-violence-in-iraq.php">civilians</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, any military achievements must be reinforced by <a href="/dateline/2017/05/Oday-Mahmood-iraq-after-isis.php">legal reforms</a> [JURIST op-ed] to prevent the justification of an oppressive presence of any extremist force which will work to the detriment of the Iraqi people in future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/171351.P.pdf">upheld an injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] against President Donald Trump's travel ban that targets six Muslim-majority countries. The ban, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/25/politics/4th-circuit-travel-ban/">announced in March</a> [CNN report], was the second version of a travel prohibition preventing people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days. The first order included Iraq. Both orders ban all refugees for 120 days. The second order clarified that only those attempting to enter without valid visas would be prevented from entering the US while "lawful permanent residents, dual citizens traveling under a passport issued by a non-banned country, asylees, or refugees already admitted to the United States" will be granted access. The court was unconvinced that the travel ban was concerned with national security and is more likely an attempt at creating a "Muslim ban." The opinion cited several pages of comments Trump made during his campaign and concluded the "statements reveal that on numerous occasions, he expressed anti-Muslim sentiment, as well as his intent, if elected, to ban Muslims from the United States." The court also found that those affected by the ban would suffer "irreparable harm" by being separated from their families and livelihoods. It is likely that the case will be appealed to the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The travel ban will not be implemented as long as one injunction remains in effect.</p>

<p>When the second executive order concerning the travel ban was announced in March, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/massachusetts-to-join-lawsuit-against-revised-travel-ban.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/california-joins-multi-state-lawsuit-against-revised-immigration-order.php">California</a> [JURIST reports], Maryland, New York and Oregon joined <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-attorney-general-asks-judge-to-block-new-travel-ban.php">Washington</a> in the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] opposing the ban. Hawaii also filed a <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/files/Hawaii_v_Trump.pdf">separate suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in February arguing that the revised order would cause serious business and constitutional concerns if implemented. Challenges [JURIST op-ed] to the order are not only being brought by states. Early in February the order <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trumps-immigration-order-faces-new-opposition-from-former-government-officials-tech-groups.php">faced opposition</a> [JURIST report] from former government employees and private individuals. In March a federal court judge in Wisconsin issued a restraining order <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/wisconsin-federal-judge-blocks-application-of-revised-trump-immigration-order.php">against the travel ban</a> [JURIST report] for one Syrian asylum seeker and his family. 13 states came out in <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/13-states-back-trump-travel-ban-in-court-filing.php">support of the revised travel ban</a> [JURIST report] by filing a brief with the court stating that the president lawfully acted in the interest of national security. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx"> Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] voiced <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21659&LangID=E">concern</a> [UN press release] on Wednesday over the treatment of hunger striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. The health of hundreds of prisoners has been declining, according to the commissioner's statement, released on the thirty-eighth day of the strike. Israeli Prison Service has transported more than 60 prisoners to hospitals due to the strike, and 592 more prisoners are under medical supervision within the prisons. The strike began in protest of administrative detention, solitary confinement, and poor healthcare within the prisons. Zeid said, "I am especially alarmed by reports of punitive measures by the Israeli authorities against the hunger strikers, including restricted access to lawyers and the denial of family visits. ... The right of detainees to access a lawyer is a fundamental protection in international human rights law that should never be curtailed."</p>

<p>While Israel and Palestine have a troubled past, the issue of settlements in the West Bank have escalated tensions in the last decade. The indefinite hunger strikes in six Israeli prisons <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/palestinian-prisoners-organize-hunger-strike-in-Israel.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in April in observance of Palestinian Prisoners' Day. Some Israeli officials claimed the strikes were a "power play" as they were started by a prisoner convicted of a terrorist attack. Earlier in April the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">said</a> [JURIST report] it was disappointed with the Israel settlement decision. In November Israel's Ministerial Committee for Legislation unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/israel-legislative-committee-approves-bill-legalizing-west-bank-outposts.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Formalization Bill to legalize the West Bank outposts. In March 2016 the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-office-concerned-about-extra-judicial-execution-in-west-bank.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the office is concerned about the apparent extra-judicial execution of a Palestinian man in the West Bank.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a civil <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/969131/download">complaint</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday against Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV alleging that the company illegally used computer software to bypass emissions tests in nearly 104,000 of the company's diesel cars. The complaint alleges that vehicles contain defeat devices and that the devices were not disclosed to regulators during the certification application process. The suit goes on to claim that the undisclosed software functions cause the vehicles' emission <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-against-fiat-chrysler-automobiles-alleged-clean-air-act">control systems to perform differently</a> [DOJ press release] and less effectively, during certain normal driving conditions than on federal emission tests, resulting in increased emissions of harmful air pollutants.<blockquote>Based upon this investigation, the complaint alleges that one or more of these undisclosed software features, alone or in combination with the others, renders inoperative, bypasses and/or defeats the vehicles&#8217; emission control systems, which were installed to make the vehicles comply with Clean Air Act emission standards. In short, the complaint now alleges that the vehicles contain defeat devices.</blockquote>Fiat-Chrysler <a href="https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/media_center/fca_press_release/FiatDocuments/2017/may/FCA_US_Statement_in_Response_to_DOJ-ENRD_Filing.pdf">responded to the complaint</a> [press release] by saying they were "disappointed" and that, "[t]he Company intends to defend itself vigorously, particularly against any claims that the Company engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests."<br />
 <br />
This suit comes on the heels of the Volkswagen (VW) scandal where it was leaked that VW had intentionally circumvented emissions tests through installing technology to determine when emissions testing would take place and alter the cars' emissions during inspections. It was found that the practice took place for at least six years. Earlier this month, the US District Court of Northern California gave final approval on VW's settlement. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-idUSKBN1871WO">settlement</a> [Reuters report] requires VW to pay at least $1.22 billion to buy back or fix 80,000 3.0-liter vehicles. Owners of the vehicles will receive between $7,000 and $16,000 from Volkswagen to fix the cars if the emissions remedies are approved. VW <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-for-diesel-emissions-scandal.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] earlier in March per the agreement. In December the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/EU-to-take-action-against-7-member-states-over-VW-emissions-scandal.php">EU decided to take action</a> [JURIST report] against seven member states over the emissions scandal. A <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-approves-volkswagen-settlement-in-emissions-scandal.php">US judge approved</a> [JURIST report] a $14.7 billion settlement in October between VW and the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the state of California and car owners who filed a class action lawsuit over the company's emissions scandal. In September the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission sued</a> [JURIST report] VW and its local subsidiary for misleading customers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.maine.gov/maine_courts/supreme/">Maine Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled on Tuesday that the state's newly enacted legislation providing for a ranked-choice voting system <a href="http://www.courts.maine.gov/opinions_orders/supreme/lawcourt/2017/17me100.pdf">conflicted with the state's constitution</a> [opinion, PDF]. The issue came before the court when the State Senate submitted a request for guidance from the court: "The crux of the Senate's inquiry is whether this statutorily enacted system of ranked-choice voting violates the provisions of the Maine Constitution by which successful candidates for office are identified 'by a plurality' of all votes returned." According to the court, the new law does conflict with the state constitution because In essence, the Act is inapplicable if there are only two candidates, and it is in direct conflict with the Constitution if there are more than two candidates.<blockquote>The term "ranked-choice voting" is defined by the newly enacted Act as "the method of casting and tabulating votes in which voters rank candidates in order of preference, tabulation proceeds in sequential rounds in which last-place candidates are defeated and the candidate with the most votes in the final round is elected."</blockquote>Voting rights, on both the national and state level, have been an issue in the US for decades and voting issues have gone to court in many states in just the past year. In March <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-ex-felons-file-class-action-suit-over-voting-rights-laws.php">seven convicted felons filed suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging Florida's process of restoring voting rights to felons is unconstitutionally arbitrary. Earlier that month a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-texas-guilty-of-illegally-drawing-voting-districts.php">Western District of Texas ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the boundaries of three voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Also in March the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php">US Supreme Court ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias. In February the state of <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/georgia-settles-lawsuit-over-voter-restriction-law.php">Georgia settled a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Secretary of State Brian Kemp over a voter registration law that would reject any application that did not exactly match personal identification information in state and federal databases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two unions, <a href="https://ky.aflcio.org/">Kentucky State AFL-CIO</a> and <a href="http://www.teamsters89.com/">Teamsters Local 89</a> [union websites] filed a class action <a href="http://www.teamsters89.com/docs/KYRTWChallenge.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday against the state of Kentucky and the governor, claiming that Kentucky's <a href="https://legiscan.com/KY/text/HB1/2017"> "right-to-work" bill</a> [text] violates the state constitution. The plaintiffs <a href="http://www.teamsters89.com/index.cfm?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID=656314">claim</a> [press release] that the bill, which allows workers to receive union benefits without paying dues, amounts to "a clear and unfair taking of union resources and dues money without any sort of compensation, which we [Teamsters Local 89] strongly believe is a violation of Kentucky's Constitution." Teamsters Local 89 referred to the bill as "an all-out assault on the hard-working men and women of Kentucky." Kentucky State AFL-CIO's lawyer, Irwin Cutler, <a href="https://ky.aflcio.org/news/kentucky-state-afl-cio-and-teamsters-local-89-file-legal-challenge">said</a> [press release] "Courts in other states have struck down virtually identical so-called right to work statutes because they force unions to provide many costly services to workers for free. No other state law requires any organization to give away its services, but under this law, Kentucky&#8217;s labor unions must do so." Kentucky officials <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/kentucky-unions-lawsuit-idUSL1N1IR1Q9">said</a> [Reuters report] the lawsuit was "frivolous."</p>

<p>The Kentucky House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-controlled-kentucky-legislature-passes-controversial-laws-amid-massive-protests.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the right-to-work bill in January. Currently, 28 states have <a href="/feature/2013/12/jshfhfshf.php">right-to-work laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The US Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-forced-union-dues.php">oral arguments</a> in January 2016 on the First Amendment rights of public teachers who do not wish to pay union fees, leading to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/split-supreme-court-affirms-ninth-circuit-decision-on-opt-out-policy-for-union-fees.php">plurality decision</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.gjyqesori-rks.org/en/courts/page/index/55">Supreme Court of Kosovo</a> [official website] rejected an appeal on Thursday against the acquittal of 10 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) members, including former commander and politician Fatmir Limaj, who were charged with war crimes in the so-called "Klecka case." The former KLA members were <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/klecka-case-closed-limaj-declared-innocent">accused</a> [Balkan Insight report] of abusing Albanian and Serbian civilians and prisoners at the Klecka detention center during the conflict in Kosovo in 1999. In March 2012 five of the defendants were <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-acquits-former-kla-commander-after-marathonic-trial-05-25-2017-1">acquitted</a> [Balkan Insight report]. Limaj and the remaining three members were cleared the following May. The Supreme Court of Kosovo accepted an appeal from the Special Prosecution's (SPRK) and detained Limaj after ordering a re-trial. The following December Limaj was acquitted again. The rejection of this final appeal certifies the verdict.</p>

<p>In January a special court being was set up in The Hague to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/kosovo-war-crimes-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague.php">investigate and try alleged war crimes committed during 1998-99</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2015 11 Kosovo Albanian men were <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/eu-judges-sentence-11-kosovo-albanians-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to prison for war crimes. In February 2014 Serbia's war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/serbia-paramilitaries-jailed-for-kosovo-genocide.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] nine former paramilitaries for their involvement in the genocide of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999. Two former Serbian secret service officials were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/serbia-ex-secret-service-officials-arrested-for-1999-killing-of-activist.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] under suspicion that they planned the 1999 killing of an anti-government journalist. In 2013 Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/ai-condemns-un.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the UN Mission in Kosovo of failing to adequately investigate war crimes committed during the conflict. Kosovo held its <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/kosovo-holds-first-local-elections-since-secession-from-serbia.php">first local elections</a> [JURIST report] in November 2013 since it seceded from Serbia in 2008. Serbia still does not recognize the secession.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A class action <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/uploads/case_downloads/silverado_sierra/hagens-berman-2017-05-25gmemissionsclassactioncomplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed against <a href="https://www.gm.com/">General Motors Company</a> (GM) [corporate website] on Thursday that alleges the company rigged hundreds of thousands of diesel trucks with devices to ensure the vehicles pass emissions tests. The complaint, filed by <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/">Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro law firm</a> [firm website] in the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website], will cover people who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-lawsuit-idUSKBN18L25Y">owned or leased more than</a> [Reuters report] 705,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pick-up trucks from the 2011 to 2016 model years. The vehicles were fitted with "<a href="http://www.duramaxhub.com/">Duramax</a>" [official website] engines to meet federal and state standards of emissions while driving under controlled conditions conducted during testing. Absent the specific conditions maintained during testing, the vehicles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/business/energy-environment/general-motors-diesel-emissions-lawsuit.html?_r=0">emit four to five times</a> [NYT report] the number of pollutants permitted under the regulations of the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">California Air Resources Board</a> [official websites]. The class-action suit is seeking monetary remedies in the form of refunds, restitution for lost resale value and punitive damages for violations of racketeering and consumer protection laws. GM has been <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-general-motors-ignition-switch-appeal.php">facing legal issues</a> [JURIST report] in an unrelated suit over faulty ignition switches that are linked to 124 deaths. </p>

<p>Earlier this week the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/doj-files-civil-suit-against-chrysler-fiat-for-emissions-tampering-devices.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV alleging that the company illegally used computer software to bypass emissions tests in nearly 104,000 of the company's diesel cars. These suits come on the heels of the Volkswagen (VW) scandal where it was leaked that VW had intentionally circumvented emissions tests through installing technology to determine when emissions testing would take place and alter the cars' emissions during inspections. It was found that the practice took place for at least six years. Earlier this month, the US District Court of Northern California gave final approval on VW's settlement. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-idUSKBN1871WO">settlement</a> [Reuters report] requires VW to pay at least $1.22 billion to buy back or fix 80,000 3.0-liter vehicles. Owners of the vehicles will receive between $7,000 and $16,000 from Volkswagen to fix the cars if the emissions remedies are approved. VW <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-for-diesel-emissions-scandal.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] earlier in March per the agreement. In December the EU decided to <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/EU-to-take-action-against-7-member-states-over-VW-emissions-scandal.php">take action</a> [JURIST report] against seven member states over the emissions scandal. A US judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-approves-volkswagen-settlement-in-emissions-scandal.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $14.7 billion settlement in October between VW and the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the state of California and car owners who filed a class action lawsuit over the company's emissions scandal. In September the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] VW and its local subsidiary for misleading customers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ictj.org/">International Center for Transitional Justice</a> [advocacy website] released a 50-page <a href="https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/We%20Cannot%20Forget%20Book.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Thursday addressing the reluctance of politicians and security forces to bring justice to tens of thousands of families who were gravely affected by the country's decade-long civil war. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nepal-conflict-warcrimes-idUSKBN18L259">During the conflict</a> [Reuters report] more than 17,000 people were killed and more than 1,300 went missing. Although the war ended over 10 years ago, families of the victims are still waiting for answers and for those who are responsible to be held accountable. According the ICTJ report, <blockquote>victims and their families place special importance on having their experiences recognized in an official way, through memorials, ceremonies, activities, and commemorative days. For victims, many of whom come from marginalized groups such as Dalits or indigenous and ethnic groups, being acknowledged in a such a way would mean finally gaining some respect, a sense of dignity, and self-worth.</blockquote>Survivors and families of the victims want to see legislation that currently allows perpetrators to be granted amnesty quickly amended but they fear politicians, many of which are among those accused of war crimes, have no intention on following through. Nepal's Law Minister, Shankar Nayak, has attributed the delay to political instability. Nepal's <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">decade-long civil war</a> [JURIST report] led to the abolition of the Nepali monarchy in 2006 with the government and Maoists signing a peace agreement. Since then, the government has been "fluid" with drastic changes occurring every nine to ten months. </p>

<p>Earlier this year Nepal <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/nepal-extends-deadlines-for-war-crimes-investigations.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] the mandates of two separate commissions tasked with investigating crimes from the country's civil war. This extension came hours before the mandates were set to expire without any cases actually having been investigated in the two-year period. In May 2012 the Supreme Court of Nepal <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/nepal-high-court-orders-government-to-finish-new-constitution.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the government to complete the final draft of the nation's new constitution by the following week. When that deadline was not met, then-prime minister Baburam Bhattarai <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-sg-urges-nepal-to-conclude-elections-peacefully.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the 2008 parliament would be dissolved and new elections would be held later that year. In January 2014 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nepal-supreme-court-rules-no-immediate-need-for-presidential-election.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the selection of a new president was not an immediate need and should be postponed until the adoption of a new constitution. When officials met in January to draft the constitution, the meeting <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/nepal-lawmakers-clash-over-new-constitution.php">ended in violence</a> [JURIST report], but officials have stated that the April earthquake, which killed more than 8,700 people, drove the leaders to work together and resolve the disputed issues. In June leaders of the four major political parties in Nepal <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/nepal-leaders-reach-agreement-for-new-constitution.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on key issues for the new constitution and settled on dividing the country into eight federal states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [OHC profile], on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21662&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN report] warring parties in Syria to take any steps necessary in protecting the civilian population during armed conflict. Many innocent civilians have already been second-hand victims. Earlier in May airstrikes hit a rural farming area killing 23 farm workers. Airstrikes in residential areas have taken the lives of 59 civilians, including 16 children and 12 women, and injured another 70 bystanders. During an attack on a government controlled village, Islamic State (IS) militants took the lives an additional 36 civilians. While many have died as a result of snipers and crossfire, some have had their throats cut and faced other abusive treatment. Under international humanitarian law, parties to the conflict must practice principles of distinction and consider the proportionality of their attacks to prevent the loss of innocent lives.<blockquote>The rising toll of civilian deaths and injuries already caused by airstrikes in Deir-ez-Zor and Al-Raqqa suggests that insufficient precautions may have been taken in the attacks. Just because ISIL holds an area does not mean less care can be taken. Civilians should always be protected, whether they are in areas controlled by ISIL or by any other party.</blockquote>Zeid also noted that many civilians are being prevented from leaving ISIL-held areas which increases their risk in relation to the conflict.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">war in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to have a devastating impact on the country. Earlier this month the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/house-passes-bill-to-impose-sanctions-on-assad-supporters.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to impose sanctions on supporters of Syria's Assad regime. Also in May <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported new evidence that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons in at least <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-syria-used-chemical-weapons-in-multiple-attacks.php">four recent attacks</a> [JURIST report] targeting civilians. In April the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] conducted emergency talks regarding an alleged chemical attack in Syria that <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">killed numerous civilians</a> [JURIST report]. That same month, Russia <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/russia-blocks-un-condemnation-of-syria-domestic-attack.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a UN Security Council resolution that would have condemned Syrian president <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">Bashar al-Assad</a>'s use of neurological gas against a Syrian town. Also that month, the US military attacked Syria-government airfield with <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/06/us-military-has-launched-more-50-than-missiles-aimed-at-syria-nbc-news.html">59 Tomahawk missiles</a> [CNBC News]. In February HRW first report that the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/hrw-report-syria-government-used-chemical-weapons.php">conducted</a> [JURIST report] "coordinated chemical attacks" on rebel-controlled portions of Aleppo. In the same month, more than 13,000 prisoners were <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/amnesty-syria-executed-thousands-of-prisoners-over-5-year-period.php">hanged</a> [JURIST report] in extrajudicial executions over a 5-year period at Saydnaya prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/26/they-have-long-arms-and-they-can-find-me/anti-gay-purge-local-authorities-russias">report</a> [text], Chechen police have rounded up, beaten and humiliated dozens of men who are suspected of being gay or bisexual in an attempt to purge them from society. The report contains several interviews with victims who have been persecuted under a campaign against homosexuality that began in early spring. Some have been forcibly disappeared while others are returned to their families, starved and barely alive. Homophobia is a prolific issue in Chechnya, a traditionally Muslim and highly conservative region. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader, has denied the abusive round-ups but the report issued by HRW shows that they were sanctioned by top-level authorities. Chechnya's leadership said it was willing to comply with federal inquiries while simultaneously denying the existence of homosexuals in the country and berating journalists for questioning the situation. Giving in to mounting international pressure, Russian <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjX56DttI7UAhXs6oMKHcjKDy0QFggkMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-europe-17839882&usg=AFQjCNEm65LIgSGr4mjJg6fJrZW4iCZ2Qg&sig2=7XBGU7qr6lCY4SSGYz-fXg&cad=rja">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile] said he would speak to the interior minister and prosecutor general about the reports. Many of the men who have been released fled Chechnya but remain at risk while still in Russia where they can be reached by Chechen security forces and turned over by their own families.</p>

<p>News of the conditions faced by those perceived to apart of the LGBT community in Chechnya was first reported by <em><a href="http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/novaya_gazeta_-_unofficial_translation.pdf">Novaya Gazeta</a></em> [report, translated]. In April Chechen authorities denied that gay people live in Chechnya, which was concerning to UN experts. In July the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-human-rights-council-votes-to-appoint-expert-on-lgbt-rights.php">voted in favor of</a> [JURIST report] appointing an independent expert to report on and investigate worldwide violence and discrimination against the LGBT community. Since then, UN human rights expert have provided reports of other countries dictating their discriminatory policies against the LGBT community, such as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-expert-urges-end-to-lgbt-violence-and-discrimination.php">report</a> [JURIST report] conduct in Thailand in November. That same month, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-experts-concern-grows-over-attempted-block-of-lgbt-rights-monitor.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over countries attempting to retroactively block a mandate of an independent expert to investigate sexual orientation and gender identity-based rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://governor.maryland.gov/">Maryland Governor Larry Hogan</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-vetoes-bill-to-ban-the-box-on-college-applications/2017/05/26/743a525c-4231-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html?utm_term=.6b89a943347f">vetoed</a> [WP report] a bill on Friday that would have barred colleges from inquiring about applicants criminal history. <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2017RS/bills/sb/sb0543E.pdf">Senate Bill 543</a> [text, PDF], also called the Maryland Fair Access to Education Act, prohibited colleges from using applicant's criminal history to automatically restricting their admission or limit certain collegiate activities. In his <a href="/paperchase/Maryland%20Governor%20Veto%20Letter%20for%20SB%20543.pdf">veto letter</a> [text, PDF], Hogan stated that the bill limits the ability of colleges to provide a safe campus environment for its students by dictating how and when schools can ask about an applicant's criminal history. Stating that "laws must balance the opportunity for second chances with our most important duty ensuring public safety," Hogan concluded that the bill does not adhere to this balancing need because it does not consider the difference between violent felonies and nonviolent misdemeanors. Hogan further expressed his belief that it was important that colleges retain the ability to know who they are accepting onto their campuses. Maggie McIntosh, the House sponsor for the bill, expressed her intention to move for a veto override. McIntosh criticized Hogan's veto stating that the bill does not prohibit colleges from using third-party forms, which ask about an applicant's criminal history, provided that the colleges include a statement on their websites to the effect that answering &#8220;yes&#8221; does not disqualify an applicant.</p>

<p>The US education system has been undergoing numerous changes amid massive litigation and a wave of new laws and regulations in the area. In April the US <a href="https://www.ed.gov/">Department of Education</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/education-department-civil-rights-office-opens-investigation-of-richmond-schools.php">opened a civil rights investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Richmond Public Schools at the request of advocacy groups who argued their policies discriminated against black students and students with disabilities. In March ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/aclu-reaches-settlement-with-pennsylvania-school-district-over-education-of-refugee-students.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with a Pennsylvania school district over the placement and education of refugee students. In February Trump administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-revokes-public-school-transgender-bathroom-guidelines.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] guidelines regarding transgender students, which required federally funded schools to treat a student's gender identity as the student's "sex." A few days after that revocation, the <a href="http://www.pawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-federal-judge-rules-transgender-students-can-use-bathroom-of-choice.php">ruled </a> [JURIST report] in favor of three transgender students ordering the school district to allow students to use the bathroom of their choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>North Carolina Governor sues state legislators over limitations on executive powers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://governor.nc.gov">North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-carolina/articles/2017-05-26/north-carolina-governor-again-sues-gop-lawmakers-over-powers">filed a new suit</a> [AP report] against Republican state legislators on Friday challenging laws, which allegedly unconstitutionally limit his power to appoint appeals court judges and members of board and commissions. Cooper argues that these laws prevent him from successfully performing his duties. The laws in question reduce the number of court of appeals judges to 12, effectively preventing the governor from filling vacancies, and set the memberships of the commissions. The defendants argue that the adjustment to the number of appellate court judges reflected nothing more than a lower case load for the intermediate-level appeals court and that another suit brought by Cooper at this time stands contrary to his commitment to work together with the legislature. Cooper is additionally challenging a legislation enacted in December that gave the wife of the former Republican governor Pat McCrory's chief of staff an approximate 8½-year term on the North Carolina Industrial Commission, a quasi-judicial panel that adjudicates workers' compensation cases. Governors usually only appoint commissioners to six-year terms. Cooper's attorney stated of the suit: "The latest challenged laws "fail to respect fundamental principles of representative government and the basic guarantees of the North Carolina Constitution."</p>

<p>The North Carolina Republican-controlled legislature and Democrat-Governor Roy Cooper have been embroiled in litigation and conflict since the day Cooper won the elections defeating incumbent McCrory. Cooper was the Attorney General of North Carolina before assuming office as governor. McCrory lost to Cooper in the November elections but <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/16/505872501/north-carolina-governor-signs-law-limiting-power-of-his-successor">refused to concede victory</a> [NPR report] until a recount proved that he lost by more than 10,000 votes. In December outgoing governor McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/north-carolina-governor-signs-bill-significantly-restricting-incoming-governors-powers.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E4/Bills/Senate/PDF/S4v4.pdf">Senate Bill 4</a> and <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E4/Bills/House/PDF/H17v7.pdf">House Bill 17</a> [texts, PDFs], which significantly restricted Cooper's powers. Specifically, Senate Bill 4 eliminates the governor's control over the State Board of Elections by reducing the number of members from the governor's party on the board from three out of a total of five to two out of a total of four. Senate Bill 4 also requires the party affiliations of appellate judicial candidates to be printed on ballots and further increases the power of North Carolina's appellate courts. House Bill 17 requires Cooper's cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate, reduces the number of administrative positions in the executive branch, strips the governor of his powers to appoint trustees at the University of North Carolina and some of his powers to oversee schools in the state. In February a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/north-carolina-judges-suspend-limit-on-powers-of-governor.php">issued a temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] limiting the law stripping the governor of some of his powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of France, under its newly elected president <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">Emmanuel Macron</a> [official website], announced its intention on Friday to <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/900095/france-to-scrap-prison-terms-for-cannabis-users"> introduce</a> [Inquirer.Net report] a law ending prison terms for marijuana usage by the end of the year, although marijuana consumption will remain a criminal offense. Macron had promised during his campaign to reform cannabis laws upon becoming president. Under <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000000321402">current law</a> [PDF, in French], offenders face up to a year in jail and fines of up to €3,750 (US $4,200). In 2016 alone, 180,000 French citizens were found to be in violation of drug laws. According to government spokesperson <a href="http://www.christophe-castaner.fr/home.html">Christophe Castaner</a> [official website], drug violation cases consume an average six hours of police time and another six hours of judicial resources. Police unions welcomed the simplified judicial process and Patrice Ribeiro of the police officers union stated that it was "a good idea that takes reality into account." French magistrates were less enthusiastic about the reformed measures with Virginie Duval, representative of the magistrates union, stating "[the law] won't change much and it's not going to unclog the courts." </p>

<p>According to the<a href="http://en.ofdt.fr/"> French Observatory for Drug Use and Addiction</a> [official website], in 2014, 17 million French citizens admitted to taking cannabis at some point in their lives with 700,000 admitting to use it daily. There has been a recent surge, both around the world and within the US, in the move to decriminalize, legalize, or otherwise relax regulations on the usage or consumption of marijuana. In February the lower house of the Dutch parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dutch-lower-house-approves-bill-allowing-cultivation-of-cannabis.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would permit the cultivation of cannabis. In January Maine's governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/maine-governor-signs-marijuana-moratorium-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium bill that delayed the legal sale of marijuana by retailers for one year, although still allowing personal possession of marijuana by those 21 and older. In April Mexico's president <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mexico-president-proposes-bill-relaxing-laws-on-marijuana-use.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a bill relaxing laws on marijuana usage. In December 2015 Colombia's president <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] medical marijuana. In June 2015 Canada's top court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that the only acceptable form of medical marijuana was smoking the dried plant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Raymond Jackson of the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dc-crime-sniper-idUSKBN18M2O8">tossed out</a> [Reuters report] the life sentences imposed by Virginia courts for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3178504.stm">Lee Boyd Malvo</a> [BBC profile], <a href="/paperchase/Lee%20Boyd%20Malvo%20life%20sentences%20invalidated.pdf">ruling</a> [opinon, PDF] that Malvo must be re-sentenced in light of a 2012 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official webite] decision banning life sentences for juveniles. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/miller-v-alabama/"><u>Miller v. Alabama</u></a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jackson-v-hobbs/"><u>Jackson v. Hobbs</u></a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders], the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that mandatory life sentences for juveniles violated the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2002/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2002-9-9.pdf">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Malvo was one of two men found guilty in a series of sniper shootings that killed 10 people and injured others in DC in 2002. Malvo was 17 at the time of his arrest. Friday's ruling does not affect Malvo's convictions or the six life sentences that he was given by the Maryland courts. Malvo's then adult-co-defendant, John Allen Muhammad, was also convicted for these killings and executed in 2009. </p>

<p>This development follows another landmark US Supreme Court decision in January 2016, where the Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Miller-Hobbs decisions banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles should apply retroactively. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">banned life without parole sentences for juveniles</a> [JURIST report] in 2012, but until <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/montgomery-v-louisiana/"><u>Montgomery v. Louisiana</u></a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that outcome was being applied only prospectively in many states. The case to apply the ruling retroactively was made by <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.biography&personid=20315">Bryan Stevenson</a> [NYU profile], professor at New York University, and executive director of the <a href="http://eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy website]. The case involved Henry Montgomery, convicted in 1963 of murdering a deputy sheriff at the age of 17. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. At the age of 70, Montgomery's case came before the Supreme Court with Stevenson's team arguing on his behalf to apply the ruling in 2012 retroactively to his 1963 life sentence. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court concluded that "prisoners like Montgomery must be given the opportunity to show their crime did not reflect irreparable corruption; and, if it did not, their hope for some years of life outside prison walls must be restored."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] John Kelly, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/secretary">Secretary of Homeland Security</a> [official profile],stated in an interview Sunday that the United States is considering banning laptops in aircraft cabins on all international flights. During the interview with Fox New Sunday, Kelly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-airlines-electronics-idUSKBN18O0KL">said</a> [Reuters report] the ban is part of a larger scheme to "raise the bar" on airline security. Other measures may include tighter screening of carry-on items, especially those in overstuffed bags. According to Kelly, "the terrorists [are obsessed with] the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if it's a U.S. carrier, particularly if it's full of U.S. people." No decision has yet been made as to the timing of the ban.</p>

<p>Airline safety has become a heavily discussed issue around the world in the wake of a series of disasters that have occurred in the past three-to-four years. The crashes have been attributed primarily to lax safety standards and poor implementation of the same. The Malaysian Airlines MH-370 disappearance on March 8, 2014 was the first major event. Very little, if any of the wreckage has been found to date, leaving questions as to what caused the disaster. In June 2015 the ICAO <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/thailand-aviation-security-falls-below-un-agency-standard.php">downgraded</a> [JURIST report] the security rating of Thailand's aviation sector from Category 1 to Category 2 after finding that Thailand aviation's safety measures <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/thailand-aviation-security-falls-below-un-agency-standard.php">fell below</a> [official report] UN agency standards. In August 2014 an Indian passenger plane, Jet Airways, that was carrying 280 people from Mumbai (Bombay) to Brussels <a href="http://observer.com/2014/08/distracted-by-ipad-co-pilot-doesnt-realize-plane-plunging-5000-feet/">suddenly dropped 5,000 feet</a> [The Observer report], after the co-pilot got distracted on her iPad. In July 2014 Malaysian Airlines MH-17 was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28357880">brought down</a> [BBC backgrounder] in rebel-held Eastern Ukraine by a surface-to-air ground missile. Airlines have since been warned not to fly over the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas lawmakers on Saturday passed <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB01289F.pdf#navpanes=0">Senate Bill 1289</a> [text, PDF] significantly expanding the scope of state laws requiring compliance with <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title23-vol1/pdf/CFR-2011-title23-vol1-sec635-410.pdf">23 CFR 635.410</a> [text, PDF], the federal "Buy America" provision that is already in effect for the <a href="https://www.txdot.gov/">Texas Department of Transportation</a> and the <a href="http://www.twdb.texas.gov/">Texas Water Development Board</a> [official websites]. The state's "Buy American" bill, similar to its federal counterpart, requires construction projects, which involve the use of iron or steel products, such as buildings, roads, or bridges, to use iron or steel that has been produced in the US. Entities subject to this requirement do not have to comply with it if the iron or steel products produced in the US are not produced in sufficient quantities, reasonably available, or of a satisfactory quality. However, a key difference between the federal law and the state's bill lies in the exception concerning the cost of the project. Specifically, construction projects do not have to comply with the state's requirement only if use of US iron or steel would increase the cost of the project by more than 20%, or if complying with the requirements would be inconsistent with the public interest. In contrast, the federal exception provides that the projects need not comply with its Buy America provision if the use of US iron or steel would increase the cost of the project by a mere one-tenth of 1% or $2,500, whichever would be greater. The bill is now awaiting signature from <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website].</p>

<p>There has been a general shift of governmental policies in the past few months with a protectionist or "America First" focus. In April President Trump signed an <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-orders-review-of-trade-agreements-wto-membership.php">Executive Order</a> [JURIST report] mandating the review of all US trade agreements to determine the cause of the US trade deficit. Specifically, the order is designed to determine whether the US is receiving the expected benefits from these deals. Saturday's "Buy America" bill comes after President Trump issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-order-requiring-federal-agencies-to-favor-us-suppliers.php">Executive Order</a> [JURIST report] in April mandating executive agencies to monitor and enforce "Buy American" Laws. "Buy American" laws are defined as "laws that require, or provide a preference for, the purchase or acquisition of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States, including iron, steel, and manufactured goods." In January, the United States <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-withdrawing-from-trans-pacific-partnership.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report]  from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/business/tpp-explained-what-is-trans-pacific-partnership.html?_r=0">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) [NYT backgrounder]. The rationale for withdrawing from the TPP was that it would harm domestic American labor. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.lacounty.gov/">Los Angeles County</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/LA%20County%20Complaint%20Vasquez%20%26%20Co.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against <a href="http://www.vasquezcpa.com/">Vazquez & Company, LLP</a> [official website], a CPA firm, alleging that the firm defrauded the county by failing to detect the embezzlement of $9 million committed by the firm's client, Chicana Service Action Center (CSAC). The complaint alleges that from 2009 to 2012, Vazquez & Co. audited CSAC and failed to address the the issues with CSAC's inappropriate use of public money including: paying for a $8,500 yacht trip for a Vazquez & Co. partner, personal rent payments, credit card payments, car payments, lobbying expenses, etc. Specifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants "provided the Reports with no reasonable ground for believing them to be true in that each of defendants knew that they omitted relevant information, contained factual inaccuracies and were misleading." Additionally, the complaint alleges that the auditing firm gave CSAC a fraud questionnaire and failed to follow up when CSAC gave inadequate responses. The auditing firm admitted that they would simply take the CSAC executives' explanations at face value without conducting further inquiries. Among the causes of action against Vazquez & Co. are fraud and negligent misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Fraud has been an issue in the corporate world for a long time and shows no signs of going away anytime soon. An April <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/ey-report-fraud-remains-common-in-international-business.php"> EY report </a> [JURIST report] revealed that there are persistent levels of fraud and unethical conduct plaguing international business. In March, Volkswagen <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-for-diesel-emissions-scandal.php"> plead guilty </a> [JURIST report] to DOJ charges of fraud, obstruction of justice, and falsifying statements in relation to their practice of installing technology on cars that would circumvent emissions tests. In February, the DOJ joined in a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/doj-joins-lawsuit-against-largest-health-insurer-for-defrauding-medicare-program.php"> lawsuit </a> [JURIST report] against United Health Group alleging that they were defrauding the Medicare program by overcharging the program and claiming their members were treated for conditions that never existed. The same month, former <a href="http://www.aig.com/about-us">American International Group</a> [corporate website] (AIG) CEO Maurice Greenberg former CFO Howard Smith agreed to settle <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/former-aig-executives-settle-fraud-charges-with-new-york-ag.php">accounting fraud charges</a> [JURIST report], admitting that they signed off on the company's financial statements filed with the SEC between 2000 and 2003 fully aware of the financial impact of the two sham reinsurance transactions (Capco and Gen Re) that the company entered into in 2000. In January, Western Union <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/western-union-pays-586-million-and-admits-to-knowing-about-fraudulent-actions.php"> paid $586 million </a> [JURIST report] after admitting that they turned a blind eye to criminals who used their services for fraud and money laundering.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ireland High Court strikes down legal challenge to Brexit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ie/">Ireland High Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/legal-challenge-to-brexit-struck-out-by-high-court-1.3100220">struck down</a> [Irish Times reports] a <a href="/paperchase/Maugham%20v%20Ireland.pdf">legal challenge</a> [complaint, PDF] to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">Brexit</a> [BBC backgrounder] on consent. Mr Justice Peter Kelly, president of the High Court, was told by parties on both sides that they consented to strike out the challenge without an order. The case was initially brought by Jolyon Maugham QC, a British barrister, and members of the Green party <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-legal-challenge-ireland-irish-high-court-article-50-jo-maugham-a7468081.html">through crowdfunding</a> [Independent reports]. The plaintiffs sought to establish that <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty</a> [text] can be unilaterally revoked by the UK government, thereby halting Brexit, after it has been triggered. The plaintiffs were hoping that the High Court would refer the issues in the case for determination by the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">EU Court of Justice</a> [official website]. The defendants, Ireland and the Attorney General, were contesting the jurisdiction of the court over the action.</p>

<p>Reactions to Article 50 being triggered have been mixed. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, responded by saying, "I will not pretend that I am happy today." Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, claims the split will lead to a significant decrease in Britain's GDP and fears that the Prime Minister will not maintain the protections for job security and living standards secured by the EU. In June a majority of UK citizens <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to leave the EU due to a growing discontent with EU policies, including immigration. Implications of Brexit extend well beyond immigration, however. In March Scotland <a href="https://firstminister.gov.scot/">First Minister Nicola Sturgeon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/scotland-formally-requests-second-referendum-on-independence-from-uk.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">Prime Minister Theresa May</a> [official website] formally demanding a second referendum on Scotland's independence from the UK, stating that the removal of UK "not just from EU, but also from the single market" is not a move that the people of Scotland support or voted for, adding that such a move will have significant adverse economic consequences for Scotland. The same month <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/">EU President Donald Tusk</a> [official website] laid out <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-president-donald-tusk-outlines-future-plans-with-uk-following-brexit.php">early plans</a> [JURIST report] for negotiations with the UK. Also in March the UK Parliament released the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/uk-publishes-bill-to-replace-eu-laws.php">Great Repeal Bill</a> [JURIST report], outlining the process to solve issues that could arise as Britain leaves the EU. The Brexit bill received <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/brexit-bill-receives-royal-assent-and-becomes-law.php">royal assent </a>[JURIST report] from the Queen earlier in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.sci.gov.in/">India Supreme Court</a> [official webite] on Monday <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-directs-liquor-companies-to-move-their-stocks-out-of-bihar-by-july-31/articleshow/58896943.cms">granted</a> [Times of India report] a two-month extension to liquor companies currently holding alcohol in the state of <a href="http://gov.bih.nic.in/">Bihar</a> [official website], directing them to transport all alcohol out of the state by July 31. Originally, the Court ordered the companies to dispose of all their inventory by May 31 but had failed to meet that deadline due to bureaucratic hindrances. <a href="http://www.kapilsibal.in/">Kapil Sibal</a> [official website], lawyer for the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverages Companies, stated in its petition:</p>

<blockquote>For reasons beyond their control, [the liquor companies] will not be able to remove a majority of their stocks from Bihar. The proposed destination states, where the liquor was to be exported, are taking long time to issue import permit and the companies have to obtain export permit from Bihar also. The process is taking time and the liquor stocks cannot be taken out of state till the companies get all clearances.</blockquote>

<p>The state government had opposed the extension because the continued presence of alcohol within the state could lead to illegal trading. The Court was unconvinced by the state's opposition as all existing stocks are being held in "the custody of the state government" until they can be transported out. The question of the constitutionality of the <a href="http://nyaaya.in/law/858/the-bihar-prohibition-and-excise-act-2016/">Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act of 2016</a> [text, Nyaaya] banning the consumption and sale of alcoholic beverages</a> is currently before the India Supreme Court, awaiting an answer.</p>

<p>Alcohol-related laws and regulations have been undergoing changes in the US and worldwide over the past year. In March the Utah <a href="http://www.le.utah.gov/house2/index.html">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/utah-house-passes-alcohol-reform-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an alcohol reform bill aimed at removing what is referred to as the "Zion Curtain," a 7-foot-tall barrier, shielding children from watching drinks being mixed in restaurants. The bill, <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2017/bills/static/HB0442.html">HB442</a> [text], which was passed by the House by a 58-10 vote and awaiting Utah Senate approval, aims to allow restaurants to utilize alternatives to the Zion Curtain including placing the bar in a separate room and providing a no-children buffer area within 10-feet of the bar. In October, the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/">Iraq Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/iraq-bans-alcoholic-beverages.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] "forbidding the import, manufacture and sale of all kinds of alcohol drinks." Until that time, alcohol was made readily available in shops, bars, restaurant and hotels in Baghdad and some of the provinces of Iraq, and it was not unusual for young people in Baghdad to be observed drinking. In June 2016 the<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/"> US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-limits-scope-of-blood-alcohol-tests-for-drunk-drivers.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that state governments can require suspected drunk drivers to undergo a blood alcohol test without a warrant but could not require them to take a blood test. In October 2015 the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled [JURIST report] that an officer must obtain a warrant to test the blood of a person suspected of driving while intoxicated (DWI). </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Australian official announced plans Tuesday to introduce <a href="http://foreignminister.gov.au/releases/Pages/2017/jb_mr_170530a.aspx">new legislation</a> [statement] that will prevent registered sex offenders from traveling overseas in an effort to prevent pedophiles from taking part in child sex trafficking. Registered sex offenders would not be able to obtain passports or leave the country, a step which will make the Australian government a "world leader in protecting vulnerable children from child sex tourism." Pedophiles from Australia are known to take <a href="http://time.com/4797495/australia-pedophiles-travel-ban/">inexpensive trips</a> [AP report] to Southeast Asian countries where they are out of reach of Australian law and are free to abuse vulnerable children. In the statement, <a href="http://foreignminister.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx">Foreign Minister Julie Bishop</a> [official website] said that there were more than 800 registered child sex offenders who traveled overseas in 2016 and because more than one-third did so without permission, "it was clear the existing passport legislation was not working." Currently there are about 20,000 registered sex offenders in Australia whose passports will be canceled, and an estimated 2,500 new convicted pedophiles will be added to the list each year. Less serious offenders will be removed from the register after several years but those convicted of more heinous offenses will be banned for life.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/03/tseliso-thipanyane-trafficking-africa.php">Human trafficking</a> [JURIST op-ed], including sex trafficking, is one of the most controversial issues affecting the international community. In October the Egyptian Parliament voted to enact <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/egypt-lawmakers-approve-human-trafficking-bill.php">new legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at combating the growing number of human traffickers along its coast. In September UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/unicef-children-uprooted-by-violent-conflicts.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] showing millions of children have been driven from their homes due to violence and conflict, facing dangers such as malnourishment and dehydration, trafficking, kidnapping, rape and murder. In February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-sg-calls-for-international-support-to-end-human-trafficking.php">stressed</a> [JURIST report] that increased funding and international cooperation are needed to successfully combat human trafficking. With a vote of 14 in favor, the UN Security Council last year <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52213#.WS2MmZMrKCS">introduced</a> [press release] a resolution to allow the EU to inspect and seize vehicles suspected of smuggling migrants. Authorized under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the resolution permits certain nations to board ships in order to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-authorizes-operation-to-prevent-migrant-smuggling-in-libya.php">prevent human trafficking</a> [JURIST report]. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced in 2015 that the Department of Justice will <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/department-of-justice-receives-44-million-dollar-grant-to-fight-human-trafficking.php">fund</a> [JURIST report] a $44 million grant to fight human trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Panamanian dictator <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40091840">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC profile] died late Monday night at the age of 83. President Juan Carlos Varela <a href="https://twitter.com/JC_Varela/status/869417750854348800">announced his death</a> [Twitter post] saying, "The death of Manuel A. Noriega closes a chapter in our history; his daughters and his relatives deserve to bury him in peace." Noriega spent the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/world/americas/manuel-antonio-noriega-dead-panama.html?_r=0">last 27 years of his life</a> [TIMES report] serving prison sentences in France, the US and Panama for embezzlement, corruption and murder during his reign in the 1980s. In January he was allowed to go on <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/ex-panema-dictator-noriega-allowed-on-house-arrest-to-prepare-for-brain-surgery.php">house arrest</a> [JURIST report] to prepare for brain surgery that was necessary to remove what his doctors described as a benign tumor. He was placed in intensive care on March 7 due to a brain hemorrhage that resulted from complications during surgery. After a second operation, he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-noriega-idUSKBN18Q0BG">remained in a coma</a> [Reuters report] until his death.  </p>

<p>Noriega was the strong-man dictator of Panama from 1983-1989 until he was ousted by US troops sent in by former president George HW Bush. In 2011 Noriega was sent from France to Panama where he had been serving a prison sentence for the murder of opposition leaders during his dictatorship. In 2010 Noriega was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited to France</a> from the US to stand trial for money laundering, where he was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-court-sentences-noriega-to-7-years-for-money-laundering.php">seven years imprisonment</a> [JURIST reports]. Noriega was originally convicted in the US of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/19/world/americas/manuel-noriega-fast-facts/">eight counts</a> [CNN report] of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering in 1992 and spent the next 17 years in a Miami federal prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Senate/">Nevada Senate</a> [official website] on Monday approved a bill requiring Internet providers to disclose what types of personal information they collect from users. <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB538.pdf">Senate Bill 538</a> [text, PDF] is sponsored by <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/Legislator/A/Senate/Current/11">Senate Majority Leader Aaron Ford</a> [official website] and <a href="http://jasonfrierson.com">Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson</a> [official website]. According to Ford, "It's important that Nevada's privacy laws reflect that we are all conducting more of our lives online." Senate Bill 538 also requires Internet providers to publish information on any third-party contractors who may be stockpiling user data. The unanimous passing of the bill makes Nevada one of the roughly a dozen states that have enhanced Internet privacy laws in the past two months, a response to the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/18/presidential-executive-order-buy-american-and-hire-american">Presidential Executive Order on Buy American and Hire American</a> [text] signed by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">US President Donald Trump</a> [official website] in April.</p>

<p>The increased "Internet of Things" has led to new and unique challenges to consumers who wish to maintain data privacy, sparking the involvement of many civil rights groups with strong opinions on the international controversy. US President Donald Trump's <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-repeals-fcc-internet-privacy-rules-requiring-consumer-consent.php">repeal of internet privacy regulations</a> [JURIST report] set during the end of former president Barrack Obama's term is only the most recent change in internet regulations. Earlier in April, Facebook settled a class-action lawsuit levied against it for its prior <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/facebook-to-settle-in-class-action-privacy-suit.php">practice of scanning private messages</a> [JURIST report] to aid in ads. Also in March, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected the settlement of a class action lawsuit where non-Gmail email users contended that Google <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-google-e-mail-scanning-settlement.php">illegally scanned their e-mail correspondence</a> [JURIST report] with Gmail users for targeted advertising purposes. In February, the Federal Trade Commission announced a $2.2 million settlement with VIZIO over the alleged <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/vizio-to-pay-22-million-in-settlement-over-illegal-data-collection.php">collection of viewer data without consent</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Liberty, a UK-based advocacy group, announced that it had met its crowding funding goal to launch a legal challenge against recently passed surveillance legislation that <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/rights-group-launching-legal-challenge-against-uk-surveillance-law.php">allows the government to record internet history</a> [JURIST report] of every UK citizen for up to a year.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-54_5i26.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that in cases of statutory rape where sexual intercourse is criminalized based solely on the ages of the participants, the federal definition requires the age of the victim to be less than 16. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/esquivel-quintana-v-lynch/">Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] the court's definition of what age constitutes "sexual abuse of a minor" was the deciding factor on whether the petitioner, a citizen of Mexico and a permanent resident of the US, would face removal proceedings. The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [materials, text] "makes removable '[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227">8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)</a>, including 'sexual abuse of a minor,' <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101">§1101(a)(43)(A)</a>" [text]. The court reasoned that because a different statute, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2243">18 USC §2243</a> [text], was "amended to protect anyone under age 16 in the same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA" that Congress intended the age of consent to be 16. Additionally the INS listed sexual abuse of a minor as an "aggravated" felony alongside "murder" and "rape," suggesting that it "encompasses only especially egregious felonies."</p>

<p>Juan Esquivel-Quintana came to the US from Mexico with his parents at the age of 12 and became a legal permanent resident. He was convicted in 2009 under California state law, which prohibits sexual relations between an adult "and a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator" or anyone under the age of 18. Esquivel-Quintana was 20 when his girlfriend at the time was 16. The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] initiated removal proceedings subsequent to Esquivel-Quintana's conviction. After an immigration judge concluded that the conviction constituted "sexual abuse of a minor" the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed his appeal. <span class="casename">Esquivel-Quintana</span>  is the first Supreme Court case to name <a href="/forum/2017/04/the-political-attorney-general.php">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [JURIST op-ed] as a party. The ruling constrains the qualifications necessary for removal of permanent residents for felony convictions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21671&LangID=E">appointed</a> [press release] an Indian human rights lawyer and two fact-finding experts to investigate Myanmar security forces' alleged crimes against Rohingya Muslims. Indira Jaising, an advocate of the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website], will be the <a href="http://">lead investigator</a> [Reuters report]. The other two members are Sri Lankan lawyer Radhika Coomaraswamy and Australian consultant Christopher Dominic. In <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-myanmar-campaign-against-rohingya-likely-constitutes-crimes-against-humanity.php">February</a> [JURIST report], the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] said that Myanmar security forces' treatment of the Rohingya Muslims likely constitutes crimes against humanity and possibly ethnic cleansing. The investigation's findings are to be presented at the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in September, with a full report to be reported in March 2018. </p>

<p>Human rights violations have been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. In June of last year a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-expert-fundamentalism-harming-rights-to-assembly-and-association.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] a report on religious, free market, political, and nationalist or cultural fundamentalism, stating that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. In November of 2016, a member of the UN High Commission for Refugees <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/troops-in-myanmar-accused-of-atrocities-against-muslim-minority-group.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that the violence is an attempt at "ethnic cleansing" from the government. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that the advocacy organization says has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-405_4gdj.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bnsf-railway-co-v-tyrrell/">BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrrell</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) does not apply to out-of-state corporations. FELA holds railroads liable in money damages to their employees for injuries that occurred on the job. The case was filed in Montana state court, but the injuries did not occur in the state. Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg explained "that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not permit a State to hale an out-of-state corporation before its courts when the corporation is not 'home'; in the State and the episode-in-suit occurred elsewhere."Justice Sonia Sotomayer dissented in part, stating that this decision will create a windfall to make it more difficult for multi-state or multi-national corporations to be subject to a jurisdiction in any location other than their principal places of business or of incorporation. </p>

<p>This is the second time this month that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of nationwide corporations seeking to limit the jurisdictions where they can be sued. One week ago, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-hands-down-decision-on-what-constitutes-residence-in-patent-cases.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-341_8n59.pdf">TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC</a> [opinion, PDF] what constituted "residence" in the context of patent law. The court held that residence refers only to the state of incorporation, which limits where suit can be filed. These two jurisdiction cases will have major implications for the future of personal jurisdiction over multi-state or multi-national corporations. The outcomes of these cases may <a href="http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=1202787723856/SCOTUS-Tightens-Jurisdiction-Rules--Again?slreturn=20170430143540">foreshadow</a> [NLJ report] the decision of a similar pending case, Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Superior Court of California, which challenges a lawsuit brought by injured users of Plavix from several states even though some of the plaintiffs had little or no connection to California.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="http://www.madamasr.com/en/2017/05/29/feature/politics/sisi-approves-ngo-law-over-6-months-after-it-receives-parliaments-approval/.">signed</a> [Mada Masr report] a controversial NGO law that was approved by the Parliament in November. The law was published in the <a href="http://www.alamiria.com/">Official Gazette</a> [official website, Arabic] on Monday went into effect Tuesday. The legislation will create a new government agency, the National Authority for the Regulation of Non-Governmental Foreign Organizations, which will monitor all organizations receiving foreign aid to ensure that the funds are being spent in an approved manner. Non-compliance with the law will lead to one to five years in prison and a fine between LE50,000 and 1 million. <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/Story/99415?lang=en-us">Prime Minister Sherif Ismail</a> [official profile] will have two months to issue implementing bylaws related to the law, and all NGOs have until May 30, 2018, to register with the newly formed National Authority for the Regulation of Non-Governmental Foreign Organizations. Parliamentarian Haitham al-Hariry, a member of the 25-30 Coalition in opposition to the law, told local media that al-Sisi's decision to approve the bill was surprising to many MPs and that the legislation will harm Egypt's international public image. The law has been <a href="http://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/12/03/news/u/uk-criticizes-new-ngo-law-calling-it-a-step-backwards/">widely condemned</a> [Mada Masr report] by international NGO groups and members of the US Congress.</p>

<p>The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/egypt-lawmakers-approve-law-restricting-ngos.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Egyptian legislature on November 14, where it also received heavy criticism from human rights groups. Egypt has in general been under fire lately for violating human rights and trying to silence protests. In September UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association Maina Kiai, <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-egypt-restricting-ngos-rights-defenders.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the Egyptian government "seems to be systematically attacking civil society in an effort to silence its voice." In June an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/egypt-court-freezes-assets-of-human-rights-activists-and-ngos.php">froze</a> [JURIST report] the assets of five human rights activists and three NGOs for allegedly accepting unauthorized funds from foreign countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1189_ebfj.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that restrictions placed on a patented product could not be enforced through an infringement suit because an authorized sale exhausts all rights under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/patent.overview.html">Patent Act</a> [LII materials]. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/">Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials], the court found that although the Patent Act allows patentees to stop others from making, using or selling their inventions, when a patentee chooses to sell an item, "that product 'is no longer within the limits of the monopoly' and instead becomes the 'private, individual property' of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership." According to Justice Robert's opinion, allowing the patent to extend past the moment of sale would "clog the channels of commerce." The court differentiated between licenses and the sale of a product: <blockquote>When an item passes into commerce, it should not be shaded by a legal cloud on title as it moves through the marketplace. But a license is not about passing title to a product, it is about changing the contours of the patentee's monopoly: The patentee agrees not to exclude a licensee from making or selling the patented invention, expanding the club of authorized producers and sellers.</blockquote>The court considered sales both domestically and internationally and reached the same conclusion on both fronts. The ruling concerning domestic sales was unanimous. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the domestic decision but dissented on the court's ruling concerning international sales. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.lexmark.com/en_us.html">Lexmark International, Inc.</a> [official website] manufactures printer cartridges. Lexmark offers two options when purchasing cartridges. The more expensive option allows purchasers to obtain cartridges free of restrictions on its use; the other option, a so-called "Return Program", is a single-use contract that offers cartridges at a discounted price provided they are returned to Lexmark when empty. <a href="http://www.impressionproductsinc.com/">Impression Products, Inc.</a> [official website] acquired single-use cartridges that a third-party had physically altered to enabled Impression to re-use and resell them in the US. Lexmark sued Impression for patent infringement. The Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Lexmark in respect of both the sale of cartridges domestically and internationally. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-appellate-review-patent-exhaustion-doctrine.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-369_09m1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-0 to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2016/16-369_8nka.pdf">strike down</a> [transcript, PDF]  the "provocation rule" created by the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] which allows law enforcement officers to be held liable for an otherwise defensive use of deadly force if the officer provoked the violent encounter. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Justice Samuel Alito</a> [official profile], in writing for the court, stated that officers cannot be held liable for excessive force under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] because "a different Fourth Amendment violation cannot transform a later, reasonable use of force into an unreasonable seizure." The Fourth Amendment prohibits "unreasonable searches and seizures." Justice Alito wrote that the issue with the provocation rule is that <blockquote>it instructs courts to look back in time to see if there was a different Fourth Amendment violation that is somehow tied to the eventual use of force. That distinct violation, rather than the forceful seizure itself, may then serve as the foundation of the plaintiff's excessive force claim. ... [T]his approach mistakenly conflates distinct Fourth Amendment claims. Contrary to this approach, the objective reasonableness analysis must be conducted separately for each search or seizure that is alleged to be unconstitutional.</blockquote>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/county-of-los-angeles-v-mendez/">County of Los Angeles v. Mendez</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] in March. The court was asked to rule on a Fourth Amendment civil rights action filed by two victims of a police shooting. Two Los Angeles County sheriffs entered Angel Mendez's home without a warrant, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/16-369-op-below-9th-cir.pdf">found by</a> [opinion, PDF] the trial court and Ninth Circuit to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Finding for Mendez and his girlfriend, both of whom were shot after Mendez reached for a BB gun, lower courts applied the provocation doctrine, holding that despite the reasonableness of the sheriffs' reaction, the officers had created the situation which caused the injury by failing to obtain a warrant. The Supreme Court was asked to determine whether the provocation theory applies, as it allegedly conflicts with the court's ruling in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/386/">Graham v. Connor</a> [opinion], and whether an incident giving rise to a reasonable use of force breaks the chain of causation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday to <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2017/D05-30/C:16-3522:J:Williams:aut:T:fnOp:N:1971382:S:0">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] an order allowing a transgender male student to use the boy's restroom. The Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin would not allow Ash Whitaker into the male restroom, claiming his presence would violate the privacy of other students. Whitaker brought claims alleging violations of the Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The denial of the school district's motion to dismiss these claims was upheld, as the reviewing court refused to exercise pendent jurisdiction. </p>

<p>LGBTQ rights and "bathroom bills" have become the subject of law and policy debates across the US. Earlier this month the Texas Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-senate-revives-bathroom-bill-in-late-night-vote.php">revived</a> [JURIST report] a "bathroom bill" in a 1AM vote, which would require transgender citizens to use public restrooms that correspond to the sex identified on their birth certificates. In April the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. In March the US Supreme Court  <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-sends-transgender-bathroom-case-back-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling in a case concerning transgender restroom policies following a move by the Trump administration to rescind guidelines that school districts should allow students to use the bathroom of their choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/grantednotedlist/17grantednotedlist">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/husted-v-philip-randolph-institute/">Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute</a> [SCOTUSblog case page], an Ohio voting case. The suit centers on Ohio's voter registration list maintenance process, which sends confirmation notices to inactive voters and removes them after failure to confirm and failure to vote the following two general federal elections. The case turns on whether the maintenance policies violate the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/2">National Voter Registration Act</a> or the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3295">Help America Vote Act</a> [materials]. </p>

<p>Voting rights, on both the national and state level, have been an issue in the US for decades and voting issues have gone to court in many states in just the past year. Earlier this month the Maine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/maine-supreme-court-finds-state-ranked-candidate-voting-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's newly enacted legislation providing for a ranked-choice voting system conflicted with the state's constitution. In March seven convicted felons filed <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-ex-felons-file-class-action-suit-over-voting-rights-laws.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging Florida's process of restoring voting rights to felons is unconstitutionally arbitrary. Earlier that month a three-judge panel of the US District Court for the Western District of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judges-texas-guilty-of-illegally-drawing-voting-districts.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the boundaries of three voting districts violated the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Also in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office">UK Home Office</a> [official website] wrongly denied residency to the Algerian husband of a dual British-Spanish citizen, according to the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-05/cp170056en.pdf">initial opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] of <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice Advocate General</a> [official website] on Tuesday. The Home Office argued that when Perla Nerea García Ormazábal became a British citizen in 2009, her right to live with her family in any state within the EU fell away as she was no longer an European Economic Area (EEA) national and is consequently no longer able to rely on the rights afforded by the directive on free movement. The Advocate General agreed that Ms. García Ormazábal no longer fits within the definition of 'beneficiary" under the 2004/38 freedom of movement directive. However, the Advocate General explained that, "[a]lthough it is for each Member State to lay down the conditions for the acquisition and loss of nationality, that competence must be exercised having due regard to EU law and the national rules in question must have due regard to EU law." If the Grand Chamber rules similarly to the Advocate General, the rights of those seeking dual nationality and their family members' residencies would be protected. The Grand Chamber's pending decision in this case, which was heard earlier this month, will have widespread implications for those applying for UK passports.</p>

<p>The Home Office traditionally had a relaxed policy on dual citizenship, according to immigration barrister <a href="http://colinyeo.org/">Colin Yeo,</a> [official website] in his <a href="https://www.freemovement.org.uk/dual-eu-uk-citizens-rights-eu-law/">Freedom of Movement blog</a> [text]. The Home Office changed its view to that EU law rights are instantly lost the moment an EU national gains British citizenship in a 2011 case when a British woman tried to bring her Jamaican spouse into the country. The European Court of Justice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/16/landmark-european-court-case-could-curtail-freedoms-of-british-dual-nationals">rejected</a> her plea, holding that <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF">2004/38 freedom of movement direction</a> [text, PDF] did not apply to an EU citizen who never exercised their right of free movement, who has always resided in a member state of which he is a national and who is also a national of <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_CJE-11-43_en.htm">another member state</a> [press release]. Yeo stated that it was at this point the Home Office "started to take the view that EU law rights are instantly lost the moment an EU national becomes British."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Illinois House approves raising minimum wage</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/">Illinois House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=10000SB0081eng&GA=100&SessionId=91&DocTypeId=SB&LegID=99627&DocNum=81&GAID=14&Session=&print=true">bill</a> [text] in a vote of 61-53 on Tuesday to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour. The bill proposes a series of increases over the next five years to raise the wage from its current $8.25, which is more than the federally mandated $7.25. To help small businesses cover the costs, tax credits will be issued to those with 50 employees or fewer. Those <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/news/20170530/illinois-house-approves-15-minimum-wage">opposing the legislation</a> [State Journal-Register report] say raising the wage would hurt job growth because it leaves businesses with few options on how to deal with the increase. Mark Grant, state director for the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Business</a> [official website], said businesses would have two options: raise prices or hire fewer employees, both of which he believes would make the state less competitive. State Representative <a href="http://www.willguzzardi.com/">Will Guzzardi</a> [official website] responded to the criticism by arguing that putting more money into the hands of workers and increasing their spending power will stimulate business growth and economic development. The bill has been put on hold in the House to ensure that it contains all of the proper language is present before being passed on to the Senate. It is <a href="http://wgntv.com/2017/05/30/house-approves-to-raise-illinois-minimum-wage-to-15/">unclear</a> [AP report] whether Republican <a href="https://www.brucerauner.com/">Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official website] will sign the bill.</p>

<p>The US <a href="http://www.reuters.com/subjects/global-minimum-wage">has not seen</a> [Reuters report] an increase in federal minimum wage since 2009, which has led many states, and now cities, to raise their minimum wages. In March the Baltimore City Council voted 11-3 Monday to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/baltimore-city-council-approves-bill-to-raise-minimum-wage.php">approve a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2022. Earlier that month the Arizona Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arizona-supreme-court-upholds-state-minimum-wage-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a state law raising the minimum wage to $12 per hour by 2020. Also in March, the Missouri Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/missouri-supreme-court-upholds-st-louis-minimum-wage-hike.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that St. Louis may raise its minimum wage next year. In January the <a href="https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=27">Supreme Court of Missouri</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/missouri-top-court-rules-kansas-city-minimum-wage-increase-must-go-on-ballot.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Kansas City Board of Commissioners must place a minimum wage proposal on their upcoming ballot. That same month, the Kentucky Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-controlled-kentucky-legislature-passes-controversial-laws-amid-massive-protests.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the right-to-work legislation. In November voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine, and Washington all approved <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/arizona-colorado-maine-washington-voters-approve-minimum-wage-increases.php">minimum wage increase initiatives</a> [JURIST report], while South Dakota voters rejected a measure to lower the minimum wage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dutch lawmakers agreed to create a free-trade area with Ukraine on Tuesday, completing lengthy and contentious negotiations between the EU and Russia. The ongoing geopolitical battle between Moscow and Brussels over the future of Ukraine, which President Vladimir Putin considers an integral part of historical Russia, centered on this agreement. All 28 EU members had to approve the pact before it could take effect. The Dutch were the final members to approve of the deal after <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/netherlands-to-vote-on-eu-ukraine-trade-deal.php">rejecting</a> [JURIST report] the pact last year. In a <a href="/paperchase/STATEMENT-17-1461_EN%20%281%29.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] by <a href="https://twitter.com/JunckerEU?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> [twitter account], President of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website], stated that "Dutch Senate sen[t] an important signal from the Netherlands and the entire European Union to our Ukrainian friends: Ukraine's place is in Europe. Ukraine's future lies with Europe." The agreement must still receive unanimous support at one of the regular meetings of European Union ministers in the coming weeks, but European officials believe the deal should easily pass.</p>

<p>The EU began in the 1950s as the European Economic Community (EEC) to promote a single economic market without trade barriers, and the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] was created within the EU to interpret EU law and to ensure equal application across all EU member states. Earlier this month, the ECJ <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-05/cp170052en.pdf">ruled</a> [press release, PDF] that member states <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-rules-all-member-countries-must-approve-eu-trade-deals.php">must sign off on trade deals</a> [JURIST report] before they become law. The ruling found that the member states and the EU share competence in many areas involving trade and if the EU does not hold exclusive competence the member states must ratify the measure. Also earlier this month, the ECJ issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/ecj-uber-falls-under-transportation-regulations.php">non-binding opinion</a> [JURIST report] finding that Uber is a transportation company subject to additional regulations and fines. In April the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/european-court-of-justice-upholds-visa-ban-for-iran-student.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a visa ban on an Iranian student seeking to study in Germany. In March the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/eu-top-court-upholds-economic-sanctions-against-russia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the bloc's economic sanctions placed on Russia were valid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN report: human rights violations in CAR may be war crimes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A new <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CF/Mapping2003-2015/2017CAR_Mapping_Report_EN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Tuesday by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] claims that human rights violations within the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13150040">Central African Republic</a> (CAR)[BBC profile] may amount to war crimes. The report maps 13 years of violence in the country dating from 2003-2015. The 13-year period examined by the report was marked by major political crises, conflict between the government and armed groups, and between rival armed groups. According to the report, <blockquote>A large number of civilians were victims of extrajudicial executions and sexual and gender-based violence; many others were maimed, tortured or severely ill-treated, raped, forcibly displaced or disappeared. Thousands of children were recruited by armed groups. Many civilians had their property pillaged and homes destroyed, and were thus deprived of their economic, social and other fundamental human rights. Hundreds of thousands were internally displaced, while others fled to neighboring countries. Civilians were too often denied access to humanitarian assistance and the ability to live in dignity.</blockquote> The report concludes that the majority of the 620 incidents listed constitute serious international human rights violations and many of these violations could also be deemed war crimes. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2017/5/592d2cf54/surging-violence-central-african-republic-forces-88000-flee.html">stated</a> [press briefing] "the mapping report on the Central African Republic lays bare the staggering suffering of the people of this mineral-rich country which is among the poorest in the world."</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2854669.stm">François Bozize</a> [BBC profile] in March 2013. In November <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] called for aid to approximately 1.2 million children<a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php"> distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR. In January 2015 members of a UN investigatory commission reported that crimes against humanity have been widely committed by all parties to the conflict in the CAR, prompting the commission to call for the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-investigators-urge-creation-of-war-crimes-tribunal-for-car.php">establishment of an international court</a> [JURIST report] to objectively investigate and prosecute crimes. Earlier that month the UN published a report stating that violent acts committed in the CAR <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-concludes-war-crimes-in-car-not-genocide.php">constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] but not genocide. Despite this finding, members of the international community maintain that there is <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">much work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Austrian man was extradited Tuesday from Poland to Austria to face war crimes charges for allegedly killing civilians and surrendering troops while fighting for the Ukrainian army. The 25-year-old man allegedly killed Russian separatists while they were injured or surrendering in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27211501">eastern Ukraine</a> [BBC backgrounder] last year. State prosecution spokesman Erich Habitzl stated that Benjamin F., as he is being identified by authorities, is being <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-war-crimes-suspect-in-ukraine-conflict-extradited-to-austria-2017-5">held in police custody</a> [AP report] until they charge him with war crimes against the Donbass freedom fighters, who are members of the Russian separatist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26919928">Armed Forces of the Donetsk People's Republic</a> [BBC report]. The suspect denies all accusations. </p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July Amnesty International and Human Rights released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine have <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">subjected citizens to</a> [JURIST report] "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. In June the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation plans to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of refusing to recognize <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers from <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/">ClientEarth</a> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/clientearth-challenges-uk-governments-air-pollution-consultation/">filed</a> [press release] a lawsuit against the UK government on Wednesday stating that the country's proposed plan for reducing the UK's air pollution is inadequate. On May 5, the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Department of Environment Food & Rural Affairs</a> (Defra) [official website] released a draft of the <a href="https://consult.defra.gov.uk/airquality/air-quality-plan-for-tackling-nitrogen-dioxide/supporting_documents/Draft%20Revised%20AQ%20Plan.pdf">UK Air Quality Plan for tackling nitrogen dioxide</a> [report, PDF], which details steps to be taken to improve the air quality in the UK. ClientEarth alleges that the plan does not incorporate necessary measures to ensure that the air-pollution is brought down to legal levels. ClientEarth has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/31/uk-government-sued-for-third-time-over-illegal-air-pollution-from-diesels">stated</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that technical documents show that it is necessary to discourage polluting vehicles from entering cities, but the UK government believes that including charging zones should be a last resort after other methods are exhausted. It is also alleged that this new Air Quality Plan is not sufficient to satisfy a previous court order to produce a new plan, and instead is simply a consultation for a plan.</p>

<p>The UK High Court previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/uk-court-rules-for-environmental-group-in-air-pollution-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of ClientEarth in November relating to a previous lawsuit the group filed against the UK government. In that ruling, the court determined that a proposed five-year plan by Defra did not reduce air pollution to legal limits "as soon as possible." In March 2016 the law firm <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/uk-facing-air-pollution-lawsuit.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] papers stating that the UK experiences 40,000 early deaths from air pollution every year and that "the government is in breach of a Supreme Court order to clean up air quality, having failed once against to take appropriate action in the face of this public health crisis." Last year the Supreme Court ordered the government to submit new air quality plans to bring down air pollution. The law firm <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-pollution-idUSKCN0WK1T4">said</a> [Reuters report] that the first plans were inadequate to decrease nitrogen dioxide emissions.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bahrain court on Wednesday dissolved a major political party that has opposed the current government, an act that <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy wbsite] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2017/05/bahrain-heading-for-total-suppression-of-human-rights-as-secular-opposition-group-banned/">said</a> [press release] is a step towards total suppression of human rights. The National Democratic Action Society (Wa'ad) was dissolved after the Ministry of Justice of Bahrain accused the group of "advocating violence, supporting terrorism and incitement to encourage crimes and lawlessness." Amnesty has called the allegations against Wa'ad baseless and absurd. Wa'ad had previously criticized the Bahraini constitution in February and condemned the execution of three men in January. Wa'ad was the last major opposition party in Bahrain, although two smaller opposition groups still <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/court-orders-main-opposition-group-bahrain-dissolved-47742227">exist</a> [AP report] in the country.</p>

<p>Bahrain has had their human rights record questioned multiple times in recently. In March Bahrain's upper house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would allow military trials for civilians accused of being involved in terrorism plots. In September 2015 32 nations <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/bahrains-human-rights-record-criticized-by-32-countries.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] a statement to the UN urging Bahrain to protect freedom of peaceful assembly and speech, and to investigate reports of torture used on prisoners. In April 2015 a human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-bahrain-government-reforms-have-failed-to-end-rights-violations.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Bahrain's post-2011 reforms had failed to put a stop to human rights violations including illegal detentions and torture. And in February 2015 the Bahrain Ministry of the Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">started</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation against a political opposition group for allegedly illegal content posted on social media</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California senators approved a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB179">bill</a> [text] in a 26-12 vote on Wednesday that will add a third gender option to state IDs for people who identify as non-binary. The bill will next pass to the Assembly and, if approved, will need to be signed by <a href="https://govnews.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/mail.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website]. Should Brown sign the bill, California will be the first state to add a third gender option. Driver's licenses, identity cards, birth certificates and gender change court orders will be included in the types of documents to add a third gender option. The bill also makes it easier to make changes to identifying documents and allows for minors to apply for gender change with consent from their parent or guardian. The previous requirement that a person applying for a court judgment recognizing a change of gender needs to have undergone some kind of treatment for the purpose of gender transition is replaced by a required affidavit attesting that the requested change is not for any fraudulent purposes. The bill is expected to decrease the harassment and discrimination those whose genders do not match what is listed on their identification often experience.</p>

<p>The transgender community has faced significant legal changes and challenges in the last year. In April the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina concerning a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 in March with the passage of House Bill 142. Last May former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the lawsuit in September. In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov">State Assembly of California</a> [official website] approved the Immigrant Worker Protection Act on Wednesday in an effort to protect against workplace raids from ICE. The bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB450">AB 450</a> [text], would prohibit California employers from allowing immigration agents to enter a workplace or to view their employees' files without a subpoena or a warrant. Furthermore, the bill aims to prevent employers from retaliating against employees who report unfair labor conditions. The bill, co-authored by State Senator <a href="http://sd11.senate.ca.gov">Scott Weiner</a> [official website] and Assemblyman <a href="https://a17.asmdc.org">David Chiu</a> [official website], comes in conjunction with the arrests of immigrants with no criminal records having more than doubled in the first few months of 2017. David Chiu said in a statement Wednesday that "In an environment of division and fear, California must continue to defend its workers, to guard its values, and ensure that its laws protect all of our residents." Those who choose not to follow the guidelines set by the bill are penalized monetarily. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act now heads to the <a href="http://senate.ca.gov">State Senate</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Immigration legal issues continue in the judicial systems. Since the election of President Donald Trump, some states and cities have proposed legislation to crackdown on sanctuary policies while others continue to stand behind their policies. Earlier this month the <a href="https://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/en/">Texas Civil Rights Project</a> (TCRP) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/civil-rights-group-files-lawsuit-against-texas-anti-immigration-bill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to challenge a recently passed bill, <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">SB4</a> [text, PDF], which they claim unlawfully targets immigrants and defunds sanctuary cities. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Ninth Circuit of Appeals heard</a> [JURIST report] arguments earlier this May on the Trump administration's revised ban on travelers coming into the US from selected majority Muslim countries. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order. Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill [SB 4, text] banning so-called "sanctuary cities" in the state and the Mississippi Senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-agrees-to-reconsider-ruling-blocking-trumps-order-to-defund-sanctuary-cities.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit local sanctuary immigration policies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/gov/Pages/index.aspx">Governor Kate Brown</a> [official website] signed a <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/HB2673">bill</a> [materials] on Wednesday that allows for transgender Oregonians to make updates to their birth certificates without publicly doing so through the court system. Before the legislation, amendments to document concerning people's names and genders were required to be publicly posted by the courts. The new bill also allows for changed records to be sealed so potential future employers and landlords are unable to discriminate based on gender identity changes. A 2015 survey conducted by the <a href="http://www.transequality.org/">National Center for Transgender Equality</a> [advocacy website] showed that just one in 10 transgender people have legal identification that matches their gender identity. Reduced costs and fewer processing hurdles will make it easier for transgender individuals to obtain the identification required to find jobs and receive access to medical care. The law will go into effect January 2018.</p>

<p>The transgender community has faced significant legal changes and challenges in the last year. Also on Wednesday California senators approved a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB179"><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB179">bill</a></a> [text] in a 26-12 vote that will add a third gender option to state IDs for people who identify as non-binary. In April the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina concerning a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-repealed.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2 in March with the passage of House Bill 142. Last May former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of the bill but <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-governor-withdraws-bathroom-bill-lawsuit.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the lawsuit in September. In March 2016 North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights chief: new Egypt law restricts human rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21678&LangID=E">said</a> [press briefing] Thursday that Egypt's <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/egypt-president-approves-controversial-ngo-law.php">new NGO law</a> [JURIST report] will further restrict human rights advocacy. Law 70, which was passed on May 24, 2017, requires NGO's to be approved by a government agency, for civil society groups to report all information on their funding and activities to the authorities, and to be in compliance with the government's developmental plans. NGO noncompliance with the new measures may lead to closure of the organization for one year, criminal prosecution, five years in prison, and a fine of up to 1 million EGP (around USD 55,000). Zeid stated:<blockquote>The new legislation places such tight restrictions on civil society that it effectively hands administration of NGOs to the Government. ... The crucial function of these NGOs&#8212;to hold the State accountable for its human rights obligations&#8212;has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. This new law further tightens the noose.</blockquote>According to Zeid, the new law breaches Egypt's human rights obligations under the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%20999/volume-999-i-14668-english.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text, PDF] and the recommendations Egypt committed to under its second Universal Periodic Review before the UN Human Rights Council in May 2015.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="https://www.madamasr.com/en/2017/05/29/feature/politics/sisi-approves-ngo-law-over-6-months-after-it-receives-parliaments-approval/">signed</a> [Mada Masr report] the controversial NGO law on Monday. The legislation will create a new government agency, the National Authority for the Regulation of Non-Governmental Foreign Organizations, which will monitor all organizations receiving foreign aid to ensure that the funds are being spent in an approved manner. Parliamentarian Haitham al-Hariry, a member of the 25-30 Coalition in opposition to the law, told local media that al-Sisi's decision to approve the bill was surprising to many MPs and that the legislation will harm Egypt's international public image. The law has been <a href="http://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/12/03/news/u/uk-criticizes-new-ngo-law-calling-it-a-step-backwards/">widely condemned</a> [Mada Masr report] by international NGO groups and members of the US Congress. The bill was<a href="/paperchase/2016/11/egypt-lawmakers-approve-law-restricting-ngos.php"> approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Egyptian legislature on November 14, where it also received heavy criticism from human rights groups. Egypt has in general been under fire lately for violating human rights and trying to silence protests. In September UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association Maina Kiai, <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/un-rights-expert-egypt-restricting-ngos-rights-defenders.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the Egyptian government "seems to be systematically attacking civil society in an effort to silence its voice." In June an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/egypt-court-freezes-assets-of-human-rights-activists-and-ngos.php">froze</a> [JURIST report] the assets of five human rights activists and three NGOs for allegedly accepting unauthorized funds from foreign countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ohio <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Consumer-Protection/2017-05-31-Final-Complaint-with-Sig-Page.aspx">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday against five major drug manufacturers for misleading marketing practices that led to a painkiller epidemic. DeWine filed suit in the <a href="http://www.rosscountycommonpleas.org/"> Ross County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] against the manufacturers of drugs such as OxyContin, Percocet, Dilaudid and Percoda, alleging that the companies spent $168 million on sales representatives who downplayed the risks of the drugs while highlighting the benefits. DeWine <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/May-2017/Attorney-General-DeWine-Files-Lawsuit-Against-Opio">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>These drug manufacturers led prescribers to believe that opioids were not addictive, that addiction was an easy thing to overcome, or that addiction could actually be treated by taking even more opioids. ... They knew they were wrong, but they did it anyway&#8212;and they continue to do it. Despite all evidence to the contrary about the addictive nature of these pain medications, they are doing precious little to take responsibility for their actions and to tell the public the truth.</blockquote>The suit seeks an injunction against the companies' sales practices and damages to reimburse state spending in fighting the painkiller epidemic. Jessica Castles Smith, spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson a subsidiary of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2017/05/31/Ohio-sues-5-major-drug-manufacturers-for-contibuting-to-opioid-crisis/stories/201705310281">stated</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] that the allegations are unfounded.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] in July 2007 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pharma.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1185030508-pdFqUnDAEbi6OEAMOlKLXg">sentenced</a> [NYT report] three former executives of the <a href="http://www.pharma.com/">Purdue Frederick Company</a> [corporate website], manufacturer of painkiller <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111085.htm">OxyContin</a> [FDA materials], to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service in drug treatment programs. The three executives, including former president Michael Friedman, former chief in-house counsel Howard Udell, and former medical director Paul Goldenheim, all <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oxycontin-maker-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 to a misdemeanor offense of misbranding a drug. Prosecutors had alleged that the company and executives were aware in 1995 that doctors were concerned about the drug's high addiction risk, but its sales representatives continued to misrepresent OxyContin's effects to physicians. Purdue Frederick agreed to pay $634.5 million in fines for its role in misleading the public. OxyContin, which is a<a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/2108cfrt.htm"> schedule II controlled substance</a> [backgrounder] has become increasingly abused because its time-release mechanism can be easily disrupted for illicit use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the US will no longer be part of the <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf">Paris climate accord</a> [text, PDF]. 195 nations have signed on to the deal making it a world-wide effort to curb global warming. Foreign leaders, business executive and Trump's daughter, <a href="https://ivankatrump.com/">Ivanka Trump</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/politics/trump-paris-climate-decision/index.html">campaigned against</a> [CNN report] withdrawal. Trump contested the climate agreement during his presidential campaign in the fall saying it was bad for the US economy. "The agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of the United States and ships them to foreign countries. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States," he said from the Rose Garden at the White House. Trump reiterated his belief that the climate deal was biased against the US saying, "[t]he Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States." Critics of Trump's decision worry that the US will now be isolated from global efforts and demoted from being a world power. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] President Jean-Claude Juncker stated that Europe is ready to replace the US as a global climate leader. </p>

<p>According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. The Paris Agreement is the world's first comprehensive pact seeking to reduce carbon emissions and halt climate change. The threshold of 55 parties, making up more than 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, triggering the entry into force of the agreement was reached <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/paris-agreement-on-climate-change-achieves-threshold-for-entry-into-force.php">in October</a>. [JURIST report]. In September US President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/us-china-join-paris-climate-pact.php">formally committed</a> [JURIST report] their nations to the Paris Agreement. These two nations alone are responsible for roughly 40 percent of the world's total carbon emissions. In May government signatories to the Paris Agreement <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paris-agreement-states-urged-to-address-human-rights-issues.php">discussed safeguards</a> [JURIST report] against potential human rights violations which could arise in relation to the Agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Knox, the <a href="http://srenvironment.org/">UN Special Rapporteur</a> [official website] on human rights and the environment, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21681&LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] all governments Thursday to fulfill their existent obligations to protect the world's biological diversity from extinction. Knox warned:<blockquote>The extinction of species and the loss of microbial diversity undermines our rights to life and health by destroying potential sources for new medicines and weakening human immunity. Reduced variety, yield and security of fisheries and agriculture endangers our right to food. Nature's weakened ability to filter, regulate and store water threatens the right of access to clean and safe water.</blockquote>Knox hopes that the World Environment Day, which will be on Monday, June 5, will be "an opportunity to appreciate nature's beauty and its importance to humanity," and will encourage governments around the globe to protect the Earth and its biodiversity.</p>

<p>Knox's statements come the same day US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-us-to-pull-out-of-the-paris-climate-deal.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] he intends to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, which would cast doubt to the landmark treaty that many scientists have hailed as an important step in combating climate change. The Paris Agreement was reached during the twenty-first annual conference of parties, known as <a href="http://www.cop21paris.org/">COP21</a> [official website] and achieved the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, aiming for only a 1.5 degree temperature rise. According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. In 2016 former President Obama and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff announced an <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/30/us-brazil-joint-statement-climate-change">agreement</a> [text] to address <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/us-brazil-china-set-climate-change-reduction-goals.php">climate change</a> [JURIST report]. Both countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions by increasing the use of wind and solar power sources to 20 percent of each nation's electricity production by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted without debate Thursday to remove criminal penalties for the possession of small amounts of marijuana. The purpose of the legislation is to reduce time spent on small possession drug cases, allow police and courts to spend more time on serious crime and to reduce penalties for those possessing less than five grams of marijuana. All of the money collected from the fines will go into a fund aimed at alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment. The <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billText.aspx?sy=2017&id=69&txtFormat=pdf&v=current">bill</a> [text, PDF] will now go to Republican Governor, Chris Sununu, who has indicated that he will sign it into law.</p>

<p>Countries across the globe have begun to legalize marijuana in recent years. In April Canada <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/canada-announces-plan-to-legalize-marijuana.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2017/04/canada_takes_actiontolegalizeandstrictlyregulatecannabis.html">plan</a> [press release] to legalize recreational use of marijuana by July 2018. In February the lower house of the Dutch parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dutch-lower-house-approves-bill-allowing-cultivation-of-cannabis.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would permit the cultivation of cannabis. In January Maine's governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/maine-governor-signs-marijuana-moratorium-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium bill that delayed the legal sale of marijuana by retailers for one year, although still allowed the possession of marijuana for personal use by those 21 or older. In April Mexico's president <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mexico-president-proposes-bill-relaxing-laws-on-marijuana-use.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] a bill relaxing laws on marijuana use. In December 2015 Colombia's president <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] medical marijuana. In June 2015 Canada's top court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that the only acceptable form of medical marijuana was smoking the dried plant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Christina Strickland, represented by <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org">Lambda Legal Counsel</a> [advocacy website], filed an <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/strickland_ms_20170601_brief-of-appellant">appeal</a> [brief, PDF] on Thursday to the <a href="https://courts.ms.gov/appellate_courts/sc/sc.html">Mississippi Supreme Court</a> [official website] to challenge a lower court's ruling that she is not a legal parent of her ex-wife's sons. The children were conceived with sperm from a donor <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/lesbian-challenges-court-ruling-that-shes-not-legal-parent/2017/06/01/997abc42-470d-11e7-8de1-cec59a9bf4b1_story.html?utm_term=.e62198ef48bd">while the couple was together</a> [WP report], although their marriage was <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20170601_lambda-legal-files-appeal-strickland-lesbian-mother">not recognized</a> [press release] by Mississippi at that time. The lower court <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3212956/Custody-decision.txt">ruled</a> [opinion] that parental rights go to the sperm donor. Although Strickland does not have parental rights, she is still responsible for providing child support payments and has visitation rights. Strickland is challenging on the grounds that the ruling "discriminated against a child based on the circumstances of his birth and contrary to his best interests and violated the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution by ignoring the familial relationship between Chris and her sons."  </p>

<p>The rights of same-sex couples remains an ongoing issue after the Supreme Court's <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> decision. Last week the Texas senate <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-senate-sends-religious-refusal-adoption-bill-to-governor.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] a bill to the governor that would allow publicly funded adoption agencies to refuse to place children with gay parents. In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-orders-south-carolina-to-list-both-same-sex-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] South Carolina to list both same-sex parents on a child's birth certificate. In December the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/arkansas-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-birth-certificate-law.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows only the biological parents to be placed on the birth certificate, finding that equal protection was not violated by "acknowledging basic biological truths." In August New York's top court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/new-york-top-court-expands-definition-of-parent.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the definition of "parent" to better accommodate same-sex couples. In May 2016 the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-supreme-court-vacates-ruling-refusing-to-recognize-same-sex-adoption.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption from other states. A month before, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/BusinessIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on business and human rights</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21683&LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] Canada to address human rights abuses resulting from business activities, both domestic and international. The experts, after a 10-day trip to Canada, specifically <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21680&LangID=E">referred to</a> [press release] human rights abuses taking place in countries where Canadian corporations practice business and the usage of indigenous people's lands by Canadian businesses. The experts recommended following the guidelines set forth in the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Business/Intro_Guiding_PrinciplesBusinessHR.pdf">UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] to ensure that the natural resources of indigenous peoples are not exploited and that human rights and environmental activists in countries where Canada conducts business are not silenced. Vice-chairperson of the group, Surya Deva, said, "We acknowledge the efforts of the Government to provide remedies, but feel there are still significant gaps that need to be addressed, as victims of rights abuses still struggle to access adequate and timely remedies." The group said that Canada's new policies on supporting human rights defenders were a "promising first step" and also applauded Canada's promotion of gender equality in business. </p>

<p>The UN has voiced concern about the rights of indigenous peoples in several nations. In April a UN Special Rapporteur <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-reports-on-appalling-living-conditions-of-aboriginal-australians.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] to Australia's treatment of Aboriginal people as "appalling." In March a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-us-to-create-indigenous-land-policy.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to create an indigenous land policy. In January, another special rapporteur <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-condemns-murder-of-mexico-indigenous-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the murder of a Mexican indigenous activist.  <br />

		<title>Trump administration appeals travel ban to Supreme Court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trump administration filed a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16-___-Trump-v.-IRAP-CA4-Cert.-Petition-Appendix.pdf">petition</em></a> [text, PDF] Thursday asking the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to temporarily lift injunctions that block the president's executive order suspending visa issuance to individuals traveling to the US from six Muslim-majority countries. The move is appealing an injunction the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-blocking-trumps-travel-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] last month. The administration is also seeking to place on hold a second injunction held by the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] concerning the ban. The administration is arguing that the ban should be implemented until the court looks at the legality of the order later this year. A statement from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] spokeswoman <a href="https://twitter.com/whignewtons?lang=en">Sarah Isgur Flores</a> [Twitter page] said: <blockquote>We have asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism. The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States.</blockquote>The appeal will need the majority of the court, at least five justices now that Justice Neil Gorsuch as been added, to overturn the Fourth Circuit's decision. </p>

<p>When the second executive order concerning the travel ban was announced in March, <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/massachusetts-to-join-lawsuit-against-revised-travel-ban.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="http://">California</a> [JURIST reports], Maryland, New York and Oregon joined <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/washington-attorney-general-asks-judge-to-block-new-travel-ban.php">Washington</a> in the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] opposing the ban. Hawaii also filed a <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/files/Hawaii_v_Trump.pdf">separate suit </a>[complaint, PDF] in February arguing that the revised order would cause serious business and constitutional concerns if implemented. <a href="/forum/2017/03/jonathan-hafetz-trump-travel.php">Challenges</a> [JURIST op-ed] to the order are not only being brought by states. Early in February the order <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trumps-immigration-order-faces-new-opposition-from-former-government-officials-tech-groups.php">faced opposition</a> [JURIST report] from former government employees and private individuals. In March a federal court judge in Wisconsin issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/wisconsin-federal-judge-blocks-application-of-revised-trump-immigration-order.php">restraining order against the travel ban</a> [JURIST report] for one Syrian asylum seeker and his family. 13 states came out in support of the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/13-states-back-trump-travel-ban-in-court-filing.php">revised travel ban</a> [JURIST report] by filing a brief with the court stating that the president lawfully acted in the interest of national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Venezuelan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ve-profile-leader-idUSBRE9450S520130506">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [Reuters profile] pledged Thursday to hold a referendum on a new controversial constitution that he has proposed. Maduro's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN18S5O4">pledge</a> [Reuters report] to rewrite the <a href="http://venezuela-us.org/live/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/constitucioningles.pdf">national charter</a> [text, PDF] has led to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/31/530778696/as-venezuela-enters-3rd-month-of-protests-anti-maduro-ire-finds-new-target">two months of protests</a> [NPR report] in which at least 62 people have been killed. Maduro's pledge came after criticism from opponents that his plan to rewrite the charter was anti-democratic. In response to criticism, Maduro said on state television, "I shall propose it explicitly: the new constitution will go to a consultative referendum so it is the people who say whether they are in agreement or not with the new, strengthened constitution."</p>

<p>Venezuela has had significant political unrest since the December 2015 election. In October the National Assembly voted to open <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">criminal impeachment</a> [JURIST report] proceedings against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there was a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power. Instability peaked on March 30 when the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the opposition-controlled National Assembly and assumed all legislative powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas <a href="https://www.gregabbott.com/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website] signed a law Thursday night that significantly loosens voter identification requirements. <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB5">Senate Bill 5</a> [materials, text] is intended to salvage portions of a 2011 law that was found to be <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-judge-rules-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">discriminatory against minority voters</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge in April. The bill allows voters who lack a photo ID to produce <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/abbott-signs-voter-end-straight-party-voting-into-law/5vb95W3p0406a5mRgysEyL/">other documents</a> [Statesmen report] showing their name and address, such as a voter registration certificate, utility bill, government check or bank statement, to verify their identity. Those who rely on those documents as proof of identification must sign a "declaration of reasonable impediment" giving the reasons they were unable to acquire a state-issued photo ID. Voters who lie on the declaration will face criminal charges. The legislation was passed along with a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/06/02/texas-might-broaden-ballot-access-elderly-and-voters-disabilities/">separate bill</a> [Texas Tribune report], <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=HB658">House Bill 658</a> [materials, text], that enables the state to collect absentee ballots from residents in assisted living facilities and other nursing care homes. Instead of requesting an individual mail-in ballot, the new law requires care facilities that request five or more absentee ballots to have election judges from both parties deliver them to oversee and provide assistance with the voting process. </p>

<p>Since being signed into law in 2011 by former governor Rick Perry, <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB14">SB 14</a> [text, materials] has been a contentious issue for the Texas legislature, citizens and judiciary. In February the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] introduced a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/doj-reverses-position-in-texas-voter-id-law-claim.php">withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the case, and abruptly reversed its original stance that the bill was created with discriminatory intent. In January the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] declined to <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-texas-appeal-on-voter-id-laws.php">hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] involving the law. In September a federal judge ordered Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-judge-orders-texas-to-revise-voter-id-education-materials.php">revise its voter ID materials</a> [JURIST report], as it had been found to not comply with an order to relax the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Japan's lower house of parliament passed a bill Friday allowing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36983409">Emperor Akihito</a> [BBC profile] to step down and calling for a debate on women emperors in the male-dominated monarchy. Emperor Akihito, who has been on the throne for nearly 30 years, would be the <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN18T0FK-OCATP">first abdication</a> [Reuters report] in almost two centuries. Akihito, 83, who has had <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-17071024">heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer</a> [BBC report], said last year that he feared age would make it challenging for him to fulfill his royal duties. During his reign, Akihito worked to heal the wounds of World War II, both at home and abroad. Akihito will be succeeded by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Naruhito">Crown Prince Naruhito</a> [Brittanica profile]. The bill also addressed the shortage of male heirs in the imperial family, calling for a debate on allowing women to remain in the family after marriage&#8212;current law mandates that they leave. </p>

<p>The cabinet of <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> [official site] approved the <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/05/19/national/politics-diplomacy/cabinet-approves-bill-allow-japans-first-abdication-emperor-200-years/#.WTGNcRM1_Vo">special bill</a> [Japan Times report] on May 19. The current laws preclude the emperor from retiring, thereby preventing a new heir to the throne from assuming the role until after the current emperor dies. Notably, this is a one-time abdication provision specifically designed only for Akihito, so as to prevent other monarchs from following suit by taking voluntary retirements. With the passage of this bill, Akihito would become the first emperor since Emperor Kokaku in 1817 to abdicate his throne. This is not the first time that the subject of female accession to the throne in Japan has been raised. In November 2005, a government panel <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/japan-panel-backs-change-to-succession.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that Japan's succession law should be changed to allow the first-born child, irrespective of gender, the right to ascend to the throne. But late Prince Tomohito, Akihito's cousin, disapproved of changing Japan's "unique tradition and history so easily."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/">Kansas legislature</a> [official website] approved <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/measures/documents/sb235_00_0000.pdf">SB 235</a> [text, PDF] on Thursday exempting state mental hospitals, community mental health centers and the <a href="http://www.kumed.com/">University of Kansas Health System</a>'s [official website] hospitals from a previously passed law allowing people to carry concealed firearms in such facilities. The bill was written in response to a <a href="https://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] backed law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/us/for-some-kansas-towns-decision-to-allow-guns-in-public-buildings-comes-down-to-money.html?_r=1">passed</a> [NYT report] in 2013. Under the 2013 law, hospitals would have been forced to permit concealed weapons on their premises unless they provided and paid for preventative measures such as metal detectors. Officials with the university health system <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article153841264.html">said</a> [<em>Kansas City Star</em> report] providing security would be costly to hospitals and allowing concealed weapons to be on premises would impact employment recruiting. After debating the legislation for more than four hours, the Senate approved the bill 24-16 and the house affirmed in a 91-33 vote. The bill will next pass to <a href="https://governor.kansas.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] for his consideration.</p>

<p>Gun ownership and carry rights have become an increasingly prevalent issue. In April Iowa <a href="https://governor.iowa.gov/">Governor Terry Branstad</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/iowa-governor-signs-law-expanding-gun-rights.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] expanding gun rights in the state. In March North Dakota Governor Burgum <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-constitutional-carry-handgun-bill-into-law.php">signed a "constitutional carry" handgun bill</a> [JURIST report] into law. Earlier that week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing individuals over the age of 21 to get enhanced concealed carry permits which will allow them to carry concealed weapons at public colleges, airports, polling places, sporting events, some state offices and the state capitol. In February the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/new-hampshire-lawmakers-approve-permitless-conceal-carry-bill.php">repeal the law</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting state citizens from carrying concealed firearms without a permit. Earlier in February the US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hjres40/BILLS-115hjres40eh.pdf">voted to repeal</a> [text, PDF] an Obama-era gun regulation that required mental health information to be shared with the national gun background check system. In December Ohio Governor John Kasich signed <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/ohio-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">Senate Bill 199</a> [JURIST report], making it legal to carry concealed weapons at daycare facilities and onto college campuses. Last September the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appellate-court-restores-gun-rights-for-offenders-in-minor-crimes.php">restored</a> [JURIST report] gun ownership rights of individuals convicted of minor crimes. Earlier that month the New Jersey Second Amendment Society <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/second-amendment-group-challenging-stun-gun-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the state's Attorney General in New Jersey's district court alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Family members of human rights lawyer <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/2017/02/jiang-tianyong/">Jiang Tianyong</a> [advocacy profile] said Friday that police have informed them of his formal arrest and his decision to dismiss all legal counsel. The legal activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/06/un-human-rights-china-missing-lawyer-jiang-tianyong">disappeared</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in November after publicizing the plight of families of human rights lawyers and activists that have been detained in an effort to stifle opposition to the <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/">Communist Party</a> [official website]. Jiang was disbarred in 2009 after publicizing the crackdown on lawyers but continued his activism. Jiang's wife, Jin, believes that Jiang <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/family-chinese-human-rights-campaigner-formally-arrested-47784903">dismissed his lawyers</a> [AP report] under conditions of torture. Jiang's family and lawyers have not been allowed to meet with him despite requesting numerous meetings. According to <a href="http://www.news.cn/english/">state media</a> [official website], Jiang is accused of "inciting subversion of state power" and is being held at a secret location. </p>

<p>China has faced continued international criticism for its treatment of human rights defenders, ranging from filing of arbitrary criminal charges, suspension or dismissal of law licenses, and disappearances. In December the UN called on China to investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">disappearance of human rights lawyer</a> [JURIST report] Jiang Tianyong, after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended the law license</a> [JURIST report] of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. In September China handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">12-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. In July China announced<a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php"> plans to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. In April a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/">Eric Schneiderman</a> [official website], New York's top prosecutor, accused <a href="http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en">ExxonMobil</a> [corporate website] in a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=RjOFq8qu5DQSZfGVHWo4cw==&system=prod">court filing</a> [text, PDF] Friday of misleading investors about climate change risks and demanded the corporation turn over internal documents. Schneiderman, Attorney General for New York, said in the filing that he had evidence of "potential materially false and misleading statements by Exxon" that could have led investors to believe that the oil company had accurately assessed environmental impact when it had ignored its internal formula for calculating such an impact. According to Schneiderman, Exxon frequently showed a "proxy cost" for greenhouse gas emissions to investors that may not have been included when estimating actual profits and losses. Schneiderman wrote in his filing, "Exxon's own documents suggest that if Exxon had applied the proxy cost it promised to shareholders, at least one substantial oil sands project may have projected a financial loss, rather than a profit, over the course of the project's original timeline." Friday's filing requested internal documents that Exxon has been withholding and the ability to interview employees who may know about internal climate change discussions. <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/">Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey</a> [official website] is also investigating Exxon for similar allegations. Scott Silvestri, Exxon spokesman, accused Schneiderman of making "inaccurate and irresponsible allegations about proxy cost."</p>

<p>A New York judge on March 22 ordered Exxon to cooperate with the investigation into whether the company misled others about the effects of climate change. Schneiderman had issued previous subpoenas to both Exxon and their outside auditing servicers, and a New York state court in October 2016 <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2016.10.26_ny_v._pwc_and_exxon_decision_and_order.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] compliance. However, Schneiderman <a href="https://www.limacharlienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AG-Schneiderman-letter-to-court-MAR13.pdf">submitted a letter</a> [text, PDF] to the court in May stating that Exxon "has failed to comply in good faith," and asserting that Exxon has "continuously delayed and obstructed the production of documents from its top executives and board members." The letter came after Schneiderman's office learned of an e-mail account under the name "Wayne Tracker," utilized by Rex Tillerson, <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/">current US Secretary of State</a> [official website] and former Exxon Chairman and CEO. Justice Barry Ostrager's order on March 22 called for Exxon to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tillerson-email-idUSKBN16T2N0">turn over</a> [Reuters report] all management committee documents by March 31 and instructed Exxon to work with Schneiderman's office to recover lost emails from the "Wayne Tracker" email account.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21684&LangID=E#sthash.3miwiBgX.dpu">called on the Government of Bahrain</a> [press release] on Friday to investigate the deaths of five protesters that occurred during a security operation last week. The protesters were killed and 286 individuals were arrested when Bahraini security forces were conducting an operation concerning a sit-in held by supporters of Sheikh Isa Qassem, the highest Shia authority in Bahrain, in the Al-Diraz Area. Those who died were buried without their families' consent and without customary funeral traditions aligned with their culture, an act which the High Commissioner called "disturbing." Zeid also expressed the need for those who are being detained for "peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly" to be released and "treated with full respect for their rights, including due process." </p>

<p>Bahrain has had their human rights record questioned multiple times in recently. Earlier this week a Bahrain court dissolved a major political party that has opposed the current government, an act that <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/amnesty-accuses-bahrain-of-taking-step-towards-total-suppression-of-human-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] is a step towards total suppression of human rights. In March Bahrain's upper house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would allow military trials for civilians accused of being involved in terrorism plots. In September 2015 32 nations <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/bahrains-human-rights-record-criticized-by-32-countries.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] a statement to the UN urging Bahrain to protect freedom of peaceful assembly and speech, and to investigate reports of torture used on prisoners. In April 2015 a human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-bahrain-government-reforms-have-failed-to-end-rights-violations.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Bahrain's post-2011 reforms had failed to put a stop to human rights violations including illegal detentions and torture. And in February 2015 the Bahrain Ministry of the Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">started</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation against a political opposition group for allegedly illegal content posted on social media</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website], in an opinion overturning three Kern County attempted murder convictions for alleged jury tampering, <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S224724A.PDF">unanimously ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Thursday that judges must thoroughly examine prosecutor decisions to exclude potential jurors to ensure there is no racial bias. In so ruling, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in rejecting the three Hispanic defendants, Rene Gutierrez Jr., Ramiro Enriquez, and Gabriel Ramos's, claims that a potential juror was dismissed because she was also Hispanic. The prosecutor had used 10 of 16 peremptory challenges to remove other Hispanic individuals from the jury, which prompted defendants to file a motion challenging the juror exclusions. Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar opined that "taints of discriminatory bias in jury selections - actual or perceived - erode confidence in the adjudicative process" and offends Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional guarantees of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">the right to a fair trial</a> [text, Cornell] and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">equal protection of the laws</a> [text, Cornell]. The Court additionally ruled that the Court of Appeals erred by refusing to conduct comparative juror analysis to determine the credibility of the prosecutor's explanations for dismissing or approving each juror. The Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case.</p>

<p>Implications of racial bias have called for a higher scrutiny of trial court decisions, jury verdicts, and the general political process outside of the judiciary. In March the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-rules-jurors-racial-bias-may-call-for-new-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/pena-rodriguez-v-colorado/"><em>Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado</em></a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a juror's racial bias created an exception to the no-impeachment rule which limited the second-guessing of jury verdicts. In April a special federal judicial panel in the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/federal-panel-rules-texas-redistricting-plan-hurts-minorities.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the redistricting plan adopted by Texas legislature was deliberately drawn to diminish the influence of the growing Latino voting population. A month earlier the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-decides-case-on-racial-gerrymandering-in-virginia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Virginia's redistricting scheme must be examined for racial bias.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Austin <a href="/paperchase/Austin%20Complaint%20in%20Intervention.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [Complaint, PDF] on Thursday joining San Antonio and two other Texas cities in challenging the constitutionality of Texas <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/SB00004F.pdf#navpanes=0">Senate Bill 4</a> (SB4) [text, PDF], a new immigration enforcement law <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-governor-signs-sanctuary-city-ban-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website] early last month. The <a href="/paperchase/San%20Antonio%20Complaint%20against%20Texas%20SB4.pdf">San Antonio lawsuit</a> [Complaint, PDF], filed on the city's behalf by the <a href="http://www.maldef.org">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> [advocacy website] (MALDEF), alleges that the bill <a href="/paperchase/Summary%20of%20Legal%20Arguments%20against%20Texas%20SB4.pdf">violates</a> [text, PDF] the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth</a>, and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth </a>Amendments [texts, Cornell]. SB4 allows officers to question the immigration status of those arrested. The bill also subjects officials who refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents to punishments such as criminal charges or removal from office. MALDEF <a href="http://www.maldef.org/news/releases/2017_6_1_MALDEF_Sues_on_Behalf_of_San_Antonio_NonProfit_Organizations_to_Stop_TX_SB4/">stated</a> [press release] that the bill will increase racial profiling against Latinos and other minorities by subjecting them "to discriminatory stops and questioning by law enforcement officials who have no training and would not be subject to limits on when they question individuals about immigration status." Austin filed its own complaint to introduce its own specific claims, although its allegations are largely similar to those of the other cities&#8212;particularly San Antonio's. In May the cities of <a href="/paperchase/El%20Cenizo%20Complaint%20against%20Texas%20SB%204.pdf">El Cenizo</a> and <a href="/paperchase/El%20Paso%20Complaint%20against%20Texas%20SB4.pdf">El Paso</a> [Complaints, PDF] filed suits hoping to halt the bill. Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF&#8217;s president and general counsel, stated that the cases are likely to be consolidated.</p>

<p>There has been severe rising controversy surrounding immigration ever since <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] assumed office and passed a series of executive orders targeting immigration. In February the US <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] Secretary John Kelly <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-releases-immigration-enforcement-measures.php">officially issued</a> [JURIST report] two memoranda directing its workforce to implement two executive orders to enforce immigration laws. In March President Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-new-immigration-executive-order.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a new executive order making Iraqi citizens ineligible to receive new visas. In February the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/aclu-files-suit-challenging-immigraton-order.php">filed a class action suit</a> [JURIST report] accusing the Trump administration of violating religious freedom of nationals from the seven nations named in Trump's <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13769.php">executive order</a> [text]. The same month the City of San Francisco <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/san-francisco-sues-administration-over-sanctuary-city-funding-dispute.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Trump administration over the executive order to withhold federal funding from designated sanctuary cities. In January the Washington state Attorney General Ferguson and several other states <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/washington-ag-sues-over-trump-immigration-order.php">filed lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] against Trump's first set of executive orders targeting immigration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] passed a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1578">bill</a> [text] on Thursday with the bare minimum <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1578">41 out of 80 votes</a> [vote count] that, if passed by the Senate, will prohibit state and local authorities from assisting federal agencies in the enforcement of marijuana laws without a court order. Assemblyman <a href="https://a59.asmdc.org/">Reggie Jones-Sawyer</a> [official website], who authored and introduced the bill, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-pot-enforcement-legislation-20170323-story.html">says</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report] the law is necessary because "[p]rohibiting [California's] state and local law enforcement agencies from expending resources to assist federal intrusion of California-compliant cannabis activity reinforces the will of our state's voters who overwhelmingly supported Proposition 64." Many opponents of the bill, including Republican lawmakers and local law enforcement leaders, have criticized the proposed legislation. An <a href="http://www.rcrcnet.org/sites/default/files/useruploads/Meetings/Board_of_Directors/2016/September_30_2016/Proposition_64_Marijuana_Use_Initiative_Attach_4.pdf">official statement</a> [text] from the California State Sheriffs' Association (CSSA) in response to lawmakers' trend toward legalization says that "California Sheriffs strongly reject the notion that marijuana is harmless... Our message is clear: marijuana is a dangerous drug and California should not legitimize its use." Donny Youngblood, president of the CSSA, is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-marijuana-enforcement-bill-20170601-story.html">critical of the current non-cooperation bill</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report], calling the legislation "quite offensive" to law enforcement. </p>

<p>As more states have enacted legislation legalizing marijuana, many lawmakers have become concerned by the anti-marijuana policies promoted by Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile]. Before Sessions's confirmation, Hilary Bricken of the <a href="http://cannalawgroup.com/">Canna Law Group</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2016/11/Hilary-Bricken-Fear-and-Loathing.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] about how the Trump administration could impact the status of cannabis at the state level. In April, marijuana advocates at an annual gathering in Washington D.C. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522821701/legal-marijuana-advocates-are-uneasy-with-sessions-stance">discussed</a> [<em>NPR</em> report] their uneasiness with Sessions' positions. Elsewhere in North America, marijuana legalization has become a priority. The <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/">Mexico Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/mexico-legislature-approves-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in April allowing the use, production and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. Also in April Wisconsin <a href="https://walker.wi.gov/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-legalizing-medicinal-marijuana-extract.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] Senate Bill 10, legalizing the medicinal use of a marijuana extract, into law. In March a government official from Canada <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/canada-may-legalize-recreational-marijuana-by-july-2018.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the country's intention to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [government website] <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/california-assembly-beefs-protection-undocumented-students/">passed two bills</a> [<em>Courthouse News</em> report] on Thursday which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB699">Assembly Bill 699</a> [text] passed by a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB699">60-13 vote</a> [vote count, text], with seven members not voting, and will provide numerous protections for students attending K-12 public schools in the state. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB21">Assembly Bill 21</a> [text], passed by a narrower <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB21">55-23 vote</a> [vote count, text] with two members abstaining, will provide similar protections to students in higher education. Among the protections provided in the bills are provisions preventing <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] officers from "entering a schoolsite without ... a valid judicial warrant ... and approval from the superintendent." The laws would also prevent school staff from collecting information regarding the immigration status of students or cooperating with federal law enforcement agencies that seek to deport students based on their immigration status. Additionally, AB-21 would prevent students enrolled in the <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/">California State University</a>, <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/">University of California</a> or <a href="http://www.cccco.edu/">California Community Colleges</a> [official websites] systems from losing financial aid, housing stipends, or other benefits granted to state residents in the event the student is deported. </p>

<p>The bills are seen as a response to the Trump administration's controversial <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/california-resisting-trump-immigration-policies-593379">policies towards undocumented immigrants</a> [<em>Newsweek</em> report], as well as the President's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-trump-budget-education-20170523-htmlstory.html">proposed budget cuts to education</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report]. In March, California Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/california-chief-justice-asks-ice-agents-to-stop-following-undocumented-immigrants-to-courthouses.php">issued an open letter</a> [JURIST report] asking ICE agents to stop following undocumented immigrants to courthouses in order to make arrests. This letter was issued following an incident the previous month in a California courthouse when <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ice-courthouse-arrests-20170315-story.html">ICE agents surrounded</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report] a man to arrest him as he was walking in the hallway of the courthouse with his attorney. Attorneys in Arizona, Texas, and Colorado have also reported instances of having their clients arrested in courthouse hallways and in courtrooms. Numerous attorneys and judges are criticizing such tactics. In February Secretary John Kelly of the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-administration-releases-immigration-enforcement-measures.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] two memoranda to direct the department to begin implementing executive orders concerning immigration laws. Also in February Chief Magistrate Judge James Donohue of the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-requires-bail-hearing-for-immigration-detainee.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Mexican immigrant-detainee must be granted a bail hearing. In January the US <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-requires-bail-hearing-for-immigration-detainee.php">passed a funding bill</a> [JURIST report] that included amendments designed to repeal key elements of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fpolitics%2Farticles%2F2017-06-04%2Ftrump-seizes-on-london-attack-as-leverage-in-travel-ban-case">made a series of tweets </a> [Twitter page] on Saturday to profess the need for his travel ban stemming from the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-idUSKBN18U0VV">London attack</a> [Reuters report]. Trump also phoned <a href="http://www.tmay.co.uk/">British Prime Minister Theresa May</a> [official website] to offer condolences and give support if Britain would need it,<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-security-trump-idUSKBN18U0YC"> according </a> [Reuters report] to a White House statement. Currently seven people have died from the Saturday night attack as a van drove into crowds of pedestrians on the London Tower Bridge. Three men then proceeded to get out of the vehicle and stabbed people in nearby bars before they were shot dead by police. British PM May <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-idUSKBN18U0VV?il=0">released a statement</a> [Reuters report] early Sunday stating that the attack was believed to be terrorism and that Britain must revise their counter-terrorism strategy. This is the third attack in the UK in two months.</p>

<p>Earlier this week the Trump administration<a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-appeals-travel-ban-to-supreme-court.php"> filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] to ask the Supreme Court to temporarily lift injunctions that block the president's executive order suspending visa issuance to individuals traveling to the US from six Muslim-majority countries. Since the <a href="/forum/2017/02/Marjorie-Cohn-trump-unconstitutional-muslim-ban.php">original travel ban</a> [JURIST op-ed] was signed, states and lower courts have fought against it. Many states have filed a<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/5-states-join-washington-suit-to-stop-new-travel-ban.php"> lawsuit </a> [JURIST report] opposing the ban.  Early in February the order <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trumps-immigration-order-faces-new-opposition-from-former-government-officials-tech-groups.php">faced opposition</a> [JURIST report] from former government employees and private individuals. In March a federal court judge in Wisconsin i<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/wisconsin-federal-judge-blocks-application-of-revised-trump-immigration-order.php">ssued a restraining order against the travel ban</a> [JURIST report] for one Syrian asylum seeker and his family. Thirteen states came out in support of the<a href="/paperchase/2017/03/13-states-back-trump-travel-ban-in-court-filing.php"> revised travel ban</a> [JURIST report] by filing a brief with the court stating that the president lawfully acted in the interest of national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

North Korea's biggest ally and permanent member of the Security Council, China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-un-idUSKBN18T2X3">voted for the resolution</a> [Reuters report] after negotiations and consistent pressure from the United States, the sponsor of the bill. The Council's unanimous decision was positive to the United States, but  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://usun.state.gov/leadership/7653">Nikki Haley</a> [official profile] told the council that the U.S. will continue to work towards peace and security, but "[b]eyond diplomatic and financial consequences, the United States remains prepared to counteract North Korean aggression through other means, if necessary."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israel has occupied the West Bank through human rights abuses for the past fifty-years, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/04/israel-50-years-occupation-abuses">stated</a> [report] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW)(advocacy website) Sunday. According to HRW, Israel has violated international humanitarian law during the occupation through "unlawful killings; forced displacement; abusive detention; the closure of the Gaza Strip and other unjustified restrictions on movement; and the development of settlements, along with the accompanying discriminatory policies that disadvantage Palestinians." Israel claims that the human rights abuses were committed to ensure Israeli security as a response to Palestinian armed groups carrying out lethal attacks against civilians. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a> [official bio], Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said <blockquote>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a child imprisoned by a military court or shot unjustifiably, or a house demolished for lack of an elusive permit, or checkpoints where only settlers are allowed to pass, few Palestinians have escaped serious rights abuses during this 50-year occupation&#8230;Israel today maintains an entrenched system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians in the occupied territory-repression that extends far beyond any security rationale.&#8221;</blockquote> According to Whitson, Israeli troops have killed over 2,000 Palestinian civilians in the course of the last three Gaza conflicts while armed Palestinian groups <a href="http://www.btselem.org/statistics">have killed</a> [B'Tselem] at least 1,079 Israeli civilians between December 1987 and February 2017. HRW called on the international community to take measure to hold the Israeli and Palestinian authorities responsible for their human rights abuses and for the<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/"> International Criminal Court</a> [official website] to open a formal investigation into the international crimes being committed on both sides.</p>

<p>While Israel and Palestine have a troubled past, the issue of settlements in the West Bank has escalated tensions in the last decade. In April the UN <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">said</a> [JURIST report] it was disappointed with the Israel settlement decision. In November Israel's Ministerial Committee for Legislation <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/israel-legislative-committee-approves-bill-legalizing-west-bank-outposts.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] the Formalization Bill to legalize the West Bank outposts.

Judge Trujillo entered the plea before <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/content/judge-pamela-k-chen">US District Judge Pamela Chen</a> [official bio] in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">Eastern District of New York</a> [official website]. Trujillo has agreed to pay back $175,000 that he received as kickbacks in exchange for marketing for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Trujillo could face up to 20 years in jail at his sentencing on September 20.</p>

<p>FIFA has struggled with corruption charges. In May 2015, US prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/top-fifa-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] fourteen top FIFA officials with offenses including racketeering, money laundering, and bribery. Prosecutors alleged these officials used partnerships with sports marketing executives to solicit more than $150 million in bribes and kickbacks to support various FIFA events. In July, the US asked Switzerland to<a href="/paperchase/2015/07/us-asks-switzerland-to-extradite-several-fifa-officials.php"> extradite</a> [JURIST report] seven FIFA officials connected to the May 2015 corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060517zor_e18f.pdf">affirmed</a> [order list, PDF] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. The court affirmed the order by summary disposition. Also Monday the court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1023_m64o.pdf">vacated</a> [opinion, PDF] an order requiring North Carolina to hold special elections, finding that the lower court failed to perform an adequate analysis:<blockquote>Although this Court has never addressed whether or when a special election may be a proper remedy for a racial gerrymander, obvious considerations include the severity and nature of the particular constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty. ... Rather than undertaking such an analysis in this case the District Court addressed the balance of equities in only the most cursory fashion. As noted above, the court simply announced that "[w]hile special elections have costs," those unspecified costs "pale in comparison" to the prospect that citizens will be "represented by legislators elected pursuant to a racial gerrymander. ... That minimal reasoning would appear to justify a special election in every racial-gerrymandering case&#8212;a result clearly at odds with our demand for careful case-specific analysis. For that reason, we cannot have confidence that the court adequately grappled with the interests on both sides of the remedial question before us.</blockquote>The case was remanded to the lower court for further consideration.</p>

<p>The state legislative districts were redrawn in 2011 and challenged in May 2015. A panel of three federal judges struck them down in August. The judges then ordered North Carolina to <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/federal-judges-order-north-carolina-to-redraw-congressional-districts-hold-special-election.php">redraw</a> [JURIST report] congressional districts by March 15, 2017, and hold special primary and general elections by the fall of 2017. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-ordering-special-elections-in-north-carolina.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] that order in January. Monday's orders come after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two North Carolina congressional districts as racial gerrymandering last month.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060517zor_e18f.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-402.htm">Carpenter v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-402-cert-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine, "[w]hether the warrantless seizure and search of historical cell phone records revealing the location and movements of a cell phone user over the course of 127 days is permitted by the Fourth Amendment." The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Stored Communications Act</a> (SCA) [text] allows the government to obtain records without a showing of probable cause whenever it "offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe" that the records sought "are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation." The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/16-402-op-bel-6th-cir.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that there is no expectation of privacy in these types of records.</p>

<p>New technology has created a number of Fourth Amendment issues that have come before the court. The court declined to rule in a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-declines-case-on-cell-data-search-warrant.php">similar case</a> [JURIST report] in 2015. In 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that police officers must <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-warrant-required-to-search-arrestees-cell-phone.php">obtain a warrant</a> [JURIST report] before searching a person's cell phone data, even at the time of arrest. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that the government's attachment of a global positioning system (GPS) device to a vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-gps-tracking-of-vehicle-constitutes-search.php">constitutes a search</a> [JURIST report] under the Fourth Amendment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-74_5i36.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/advocate-health-care-network-v-stapleton/">Advocate Health Care Network v. Stapleton</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a church-affiliated hospital's pension fund is exempt from the federal pension law. The court held that under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-18">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [materials], a defined-benefit pension plan maintained by a church-affiliated organization qualifies as a "church plan," even though it was established by the healthcare facility, not the church. Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court:<blockquote>ERISA provides (1) that a "church plan" means a "plan established and maintained ... by a church" and (2) that a "plan established and maintained ... by a church is to "include[] a plan maintained by" a principal-purpose organization. Under the best reading of the statute, a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization therefore qualifies as a "church plan," regardless of who established it.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion.</p>

<p>The case was consolidated with <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/saint-peters-healthcare-system-v-kaplan/">Saint Peter's Healthcare System v. Kaplan</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dignity-health-v-rollins/">Dignity Health v. Rollins</a> [dockets]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in March after granting <em>certiorari</em> in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that forfeiture is limited to property the defendant actually obtained as a result of the crime or "tainted property." The court held that the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/98th-congress/senate-bill/948">Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984</a> [text] limits property to the definitions within the act and rejected the government's argument that the standard should be the background principle of conspiracy liability that the conspirators be responsible for each other's foreseeable actions within the common plan. Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the majority opinion stated:<blockquote>Forfeiture pursuant to §853(a)(1) is limited to property the defendant himself actually acquired as the result of the crime. In this case, the Government has conceded that Terry Honeycutt had no ownership interest in his brother's store and did not personally benefit from the Polar Pure sales. App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a. The District Court agreed...Because Honeycutt never obtained tainted property as a result of the crime, §853 does not require any forfeiture.</blockquote>The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-criminal-evidence-sharing-asset-forfeiture.php">heard arguments</a> for the case in March after <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-to-rule-in-drug-forfeiture-case.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that claims for disgorgement in an SEC enforcement action are held within the five-year statute of limitations. The court was unanimous in its opinion that the SEC filing for <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/disgorgement">disgorgement</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to prevent unjust enrichment is limited as it is a penalty that requires a statute of limitations. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the opinion, which reversed lower court's decision. "SEC disgorgement thus bears all the hallmarks of a penalty: It is imposed as a consequence of violating a public law and it is intended to deter, not to compensate. The 5-year statute of limitations in §2462 therefore applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement."</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in January and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-sec-suit-time-limits-debt-collector-status.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippine opposition lawmakers petitioned the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday to reject <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-36659258">President Rodrigo Duterte</a>'s [BBC profile] imposition of martial law. Duterte declared martial law on May 23 when heavily armed militants linked to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/philippines-president-declares-martial-law-as-militants-invade-marawi-city.php">took over</a> [JURIST report] large parts of Marawi City, a provincial capital in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Six House lawmakers, led by <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/members/search.php?id=lagman-ed">Representative Edcel Lagman</a> [official profile], <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-06-05/philippine-lawmakers-ask-top-court-to-nullify-martial-law">said</a> [AP report] those allied with Duterte should have held joint sessions to evaluate the constitutionality of the President's declaration. The petitioners said the claims that militants took over a hospital and decapitated a local police chief were incorrect. The also asserted that the conflict was caused by a government operation to capture a high-profile militant commander and not an unprompted uprising. Critics of Duterte's declaration of martial law say it <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-faces-martial-law-legal-challenge-1707945">parallels</a> [AFP report] former dictator Ferdinand Marcos' rise to power. The martial law declaration has raised suspicions as to whether Duterte has other motivations, as he has introduced the prospect of martial law several times in connection with his deadly attempt to suppress drug sales in the Philippines. Duterte said he would ignore any opposition from the Supreme Court on the issue. The Supreme Court has 30 days to make a decision regarding the petition. </p>

<p>More than 8,000 people have reportedly been killed over drug-related offenses since Duterte took office last year. Numerous rights groups have been critical of the killings and have spoken out against the current administration. Early in March <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report that accused the police of <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-report-police-deceive-to-justify-war-on-drugs-killings-in-philippines.php">falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the alleged police killings of citizens. This policy of sanctioned killings has been part of Duterte's rhetoric since his time as mayor of Davao City. In December a UN Human rights chief <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-rights-chief-urges-murder-investigation-of-philippines-president.php">called for a murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] after Duterte admitted to killing people in his role as mayor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fugitive ex-governor of Quintana Roo, Mexico, Roberto Borge, was arrested on Monday in Panama. Borge, a member of President Enrique Peña Nieto's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was taken into custody on charges of corruption. He was <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-06-05/mexico-ex-gov-sought-on-corruption-charges-nabbed-in-panama">wanted</a> [AP report] in connection with the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of state properties. Borge denies all charges. The ex-governor was apprehended <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-corruption-idUSKBN18W0QR">with the aid</a> [Reuters report] of <a href="https://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a> [official website] as he was preparing to board a flight to Paris. Mexico is asking Panamanian prosecutors for his extradition. Borge is the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40157738">third</a> [BBC report] fugitive former governor to be arrested this year after several of those accused of corruption went on the run. </p>

<p>Mexico has been plagued with corruption scandals in the past year further complicating the country's drug crisis. Attorney General Edgar Veytia of the state of Nayarit, Mexico, was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/mexico-state-ag-arrested-in-san-diego-for-drug-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of international narcotics trafficking conspiracy, according to court documents filed by federal officials in March. In January UN Special Rapporteur Michel Forst <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-impunity-in-mexico.php">delivered</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary report recommending to Mexico authorities improvements concerning the protection of human rights defenders after <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-urges-mexico-to-investigate-summary-executions.php">reports</a> [JURIST report] of disappearances in Mexico began to surface. In September the Mexican Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/mexico-supreme-court-overturns-state-anti-corruption-laws.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] two state anti-corruption laws that would have allowed departing governors to choose prosecutors in charge of investigating corruption allegations against them. In June the Mexican Congress <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/mexico-congress-passes-anti-corruption-bills.php">passed several anti-corruption bills</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the severity of penalties for corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-605_kjfl.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-chester-v-laroe-estates-inc/">Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that as-of-right intervenors must have independent <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> standing to intervene under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_24">Rule 24(a)(2)</a> [LII materials]. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. In 2012 Steven Sherman, a land developer, filed suit against the Town of Chester for obstructing plans for a subdivision, costing Sherman $5.5 million and nearly bankrupting him. Laroe, Sherman's investor, filed to intervene when the court of appeals remanded the case. Laroe argued that "under New York law, it is 'the equitable owner of the Real Property' at issue in Sherman's suit" and sought damages "for the taking of Laroe's interest in the subject real property." The court concluded that because Laroe sought damages different from those sought by Sherman, they must produce their own standing to proceed.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php">January</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jurisdiction-joinder-standing.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Dainius Puras, on Tuesday called for a revolutionary overhaul of the mental health care systems around the world. Presenting his <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/35/21">report</a> [materials] to the UN Human Righs Council, Puras noted that, in the current system, less than 7 percent of health care budgets globally are dedicated to mental health care. This has led to human rights violations, specifically, a denial of the right to the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health. Puras' report calls for a shift from the current biomedical model of mental health, which views mental health problems as neurobiological issues best treated by medication, to a more rights-based approach. The rights-based model would remedy the stigma, discrimination, and medical coercion experienced by those suffering from mental health problems by focusing on the inherent right to mental health and making sure those who bear a duty to people seeking mental health help understand their duty to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to mental health for all. Puras believes that an overhaul of the current system can be achieved by the people with power in the psychiatric profession taking initiative and integrating mental health into public policy.</p>

<p>The right to the highest attainable standard of health and treatment of those with health problems has been a pressing issue lately. Most recently, in May, the High-Level Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children, and Adolescents released a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-group-calls-on-world-leaders-to-invest-in-health-and-well-being.php">report</a> [JURIST report] urging world leaders to allocate 5 percent of their GDP to public health spending. Earlier in May Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-dangerous-healthcare-conditions-in-us-immigration-centers.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that there are "systemic failures, such as unreasonable delays in care and unqualified medical staff leading to "dangerously subpar" medical care in US immigration detention centers. In September HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/hrw-urges-pakistan-not-to-execute-man-with-intellectual-disability.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistani authorities not to execute a mentally disabled man, expressing their belief that executing people with mental health conditions is an affront to decency and serves no criminal justice purpose.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2017/Jun17/59opn17-Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a 2001 New York zoning ordinance that banned "adult" establishments from residential and most commercial and manufacturing zones was not a violation of the owners' First Amendment rights. The zoning ordinance classified adult eating and drinking establishments as "regularly featuring live performances characterized by an emphasis on specified anatomical areas or specified sexual activities in any portion of the establishment." The ordinance classified adult bookstores as establishments with at least 40 percent of their floor/stock dedicated to adult purposes. Many establishments attempted to circumvent the ordinances in place before this 2001 amendment. The court held that the city satisfied its burden of proving that many businesses were in "sham" compliance with the older ordinances, which justified strengthening the initial ordinances with the 2001 amendments.</p>

<p>Zoning ordinances can be a source on controversy in regard to the constitutional rights of people as well as business owners. In January, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-chicago-gun-range-restrictions.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Chicago restrictions on gun ranges throughout the city. The court held that these restrictions violated Chicago citizens' Second Amendment rights because they were excessively broad and were not supported by evidence demonstrating the city's interest in regulating gun ranges. In July the US Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against a Pennsylvania town for denying zoning approval to a mosque in 2014. In January 2014 a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/chicago-gun-sales-ban-ruled-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Chicago ordinance that banned the licensed sale of firearms in the city. In 2014 in Kennesaw, Georgia, the Kennesaw City Council <a href="/hotline/2015/01/azadeh-shahshahani-mosque-controversy.php">refused to issue a permit</a> [JURIST op-ed] to build a mosque in a "retail only district" despite having done so for a Pentecostal church prior. The city council overturned its decision after the DOJ threatened file suit against the city.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-government-contractor-georgia-charged-removing-and-mailing-classified-materials-news">announced</a> [statement] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/971336/download">charges</a> [complaint, PDF] against a federal contractor Monday for leaking classified material to a media source. Reality Leigh Winner operated under Pluribus International Corporation in Georgia at the time she is alleged to have removed material from a US government facility. Winner maintained top secret clearance since February. She is charged with gathering, transmitting or losing defense material. Winner is suspected of transmitting a report to The Intercept, an online news organization. The report at issue contained information <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RUSSIA_HACKING_ELECTION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">alleging</a> [AP report] a Russian cyber attack took place on a voting software supplier before the last US presidential election.</p>

<p>Possible hackings and data breaches have caused serious concern in recent years. In March the DOJ announced the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-charges-russian-officers-for-hacking-email-accounts.php">indictments</a> [JURIST report] of four Russian nationals in connection with hacking e-mail accounts. In January a group of 10 US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-senate-bill-seeks-mandatory-sanctions-against-russia-for-hacking.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at implementing mandatory sanctions against Russia for its involvement in cyber hacking during the 2016 presidential election. In October 2015, at the request of US government officials, Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/china-hackers-arrested-following-request-from-us-law-enforcement.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] individual hackers that allegedly misappropriated commercial secrets from US firms with the intention to sell proprietary information to state-owned entities within the the People's Republic of China. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official website] signed a series of abortion regulations into law on Tuesday. <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=85R&Bill=SB8">Senate Bill 8</a> [materials] will require the burial or cremation of fetal tissue and bans the donation of fetal tissue. The legislation also bans so called "partial-birth abortion," which is already banned by federal law, as well as the dilation and evacuation procedure, a common second trimester abortion technique. Also Tuesday Abbott announced a special legislative session to take up additional abortion-related measures, as well as other controversial items such as the "bathroom bill."</p>

<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a controversial Texas abortion law in June. The court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">HB2 </a>[text], which imposed certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors, created an undue burden on access to abortion, and was therefore unconstitutional. A Texas regulation requiring the burial of fetal remains has been <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-halts-texas-rule-requiring-burial-of-fetal-remains.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearings will begin at 10:00 am EDT.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><div style="text-align: center;">Statement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence James B. Comey June 8, 2017 </div></strong>  </p>

<p>Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with President-Elect and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee.  </p>

<p><u>January 6 Briefing</u>  </p>

<p>I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the PresidentElect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.   </p>

<p>The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing. </p>

<p>The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI&#8217;s counter-intelligence responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect. Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBI&#8217;s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conduct.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigations are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work. The Bureau&#8217;s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves &#8220;turning&#8221; the recruited person into a double-agent, or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy-based intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities. </p>

<p>Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will &#8220;open an investigation&#8221; on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted. </p>

<p>In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBI&#8217;s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true; we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, based on PresidentElect Trump&#8217;s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. </p>

<p>I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone) - once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine one-on-one conversations with President Trump in four months - three in person and six on the phone. </p>

<p><u>January 27 Dinner </u></p>

<p>The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and  3 invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others. </p>

<p>It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. </p>

<p>The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away. </p>

<p>My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBI&#8217;s traditionally independent status in the executive branch. </p>

<p>I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my tenyear term as Director. And then, because the set-up made me uneasy, I added that I was not &#8220;reliable&#8221; in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybody&#8217;s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President. </p>

<p>A few moments later, the President said, &#8220;I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. </p>

<p>At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because &#8220;problems&#8221; come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work. </p>

<p>Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things  4 about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, &#8220;I need loyalty.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;You will always get honesty from me.&#8221; He paused and then said, &#8220;That&#8217;s what I want, honest loyalty.&#8221; I paused, and then said, &#8220;You will get that from me.&#8221; As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase &#8220;honest loyalty&#8221; differently, but I decided it wouldn&#8217;t be productive to push it further. The term - honest loyalty - had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect. </p>

<p>During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn&#8217;t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren&#8217;t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it. </p>

<p>As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI.</p>

<p><u>February 14 Oval Office Meeting</u></p>

<p>On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi-circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the semi-circle of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs. </p>

<p>The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me. </p>

<p>When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, &#8220;I want to talk about Mike Flynn.&#8221; Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify. </p>

<p>The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information - a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed. </p>

<p>The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, &#8220;He is a good guy and has been through a lot.&#8221; He repeated that Flynn hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, &#8220;I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.&#8221; I replied only that &#8220;he is a good guy.&#8221; (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would &#8220;let this go.&#8221; </p>

<p>The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President. </p>

<p>I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn&#8217;s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI&#8217;s role as an independent investigative agency. </p>

<p>The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the President&#8217;s request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney General&#8217;s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role.  6 After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members - or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them - aware of the President&#8217;s request. </p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the President&#8217;s concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened - him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind - was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBI&#8217;s potential investigation of General Flynn. </p>

<p><u>March 30 Phone Call</u></p>

<p>On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as &#8220;a cloud&#8221; that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to &#8220;lift the cloud.&#8221; I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn&#8217;t find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this was causing him. </p>

<p>Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week - at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, &#8220;We need to get that fact out.&#8221; (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.) </p>

<p>The President went on to say that if there were some &#8220;satellite&#8221; associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he  7 hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren&#8217;t investigating him. </p>

<p>In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadn&#8217;t brought up &#8220;the McCabe thing&#8221; because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe&#8217;s wife) campaign money. Although I didn&#8217;t understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person. </p>

<p>He finished by stressing &#8220;the cloud&#8221; that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn&#8217;t being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could. </p>

<p>Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matters), to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later. </p>

<p><u>April 11 Phone Call</u><br />
On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I &#8220;get out&#8221; that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that &#8220;the cloud&#8221; was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. </p>

<p>He said he would do that and added, &#8220;Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal; we had that thing you know.&#8221; I did not reply or ask him what he meant by &#8220;that thing.&#8221; I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended. That was the last time I spoke with President Trump. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware legislature</a> [official website] approved a <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/BillDetail/25694">bill</a> [SB5 materials] on Tuesday that guarantees access to abortion. The bill, which was previously approved by the state Senate, was approved by a vote of 22-16 after five hours of debate and discussion. The bill ensures that the provisions of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113">Roe v. Wade</a> [LII materials] remain legal at the state level should the historical case be overturned. Under Delaware's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/delaware-house-votes-on-bill-protecting-abortion-rights/2017/06/06/6440ae90-4a84-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html?utm_term=.827c18e32417">current laws</a> [AP report] abortions are only permitted if the mother's health is at risk, if there is significant indications that a child will be born with disabilities, or if the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. The new legislation lifts any restrictions on abortions prior to the stage where a fetus reaches viability. A similar bill to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-abortion-delaware-idUSKBN18X1II">protect abortion rights</a> [Reuters report] was approved by the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/">Illinois legislature </a>[official website] in May but the state's governor, Bruce Rauner, has said he would veto it. New York has also written legislation to protect abortion rights, but it has stalled in the Senate. </p>

<p>Access to abortion has been a recent issue since President Donald Trump vowed to appoint a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] justice who will overturn <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>. Also on Tuesday Texas Governor <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/">Greg Abbott</a> [official website] signed a series of abortion regulations into <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">law</a> [JURIST report]. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/">US Agency for International Development</a> [official website] to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. In February the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. That same month the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/florida-supreme-court-blocks-law-on-mandatory-abortion-waiting-period.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the Mandatory Delay Law, which requires that a woman wait 24 hours after receiving counseling from a physician before she can have an abortion. Also in February the <a href="http://www.pasen.gov/">Pennsylvania Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/DE/Homepage/homepage_node.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2017/04/ls20170413_2bvl000613.html">ruled</a> [judgment, in German] on Wednesday that a tax on nuclear fuel was illegal. The tax, implemented in January 2011, <a href="http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-German-high-court-rules-nuclear-fuel-tax-illegal-0706174.html">charged</a> [World Nuclear News report] nuclear power plants €145 per gram of fissile nuclear fuel loaded in a power plant. The court ruled that the tax did not fit within the types of excise duty allowed by the Basic Law. When the tax was initially enacted, in included a provision that allowed for the extended operation of the country's nuclear power plants. However, after the 2011 Fukushima accident, Germany removed the extended operation provision, closed some older units early, but kept the tax in place. With the court ruling, the German utilities may be reimbursed the €6.3 billion (USD $7.1 billion) the utilities paid for the tax between 2011 and 2016. The European Court of Justice ruled in June 2015 that the tax did not violate EU laws.</p>

<p>The role of nuclear power plants in countries throughout the world have been a significant focus since the Fukushima accident. Voters in Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/switzerland-voters-back-renewable-energy-plan.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in May to phase out nuclear power in the country. This vote came just six months after a previous Switzerland resolution that voters <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/switzerland-votes-to-keep-nuclear-power-options.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] that called for the phase out of nuclear power in the country. In the US, Ohio lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/ohio-legislators-introduce-bill-to-give-nuclear-power-plans-emissions-credits.php">introduced</a> a bill in April to give nuclear power plants Zero Emission Credits, and a lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/lawsuit-challenges-illinois-future-energy-jobs-act.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] in Illinois in February against a recently enacted law that gave Zero Emission Credits to nuclear power plants in the state. A Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/japan-court-allows-nuclear-reactors-to-reopen.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in December 2015 to allow the restart of two nuclear power plants in the Fukui district.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] lifted the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060617zr_097c.pdf">stay of execution</a> [order, PDF] granted last week by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] for Robert Melson late Tuesday. The brief order was <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2017/06/alabama_execution_back_on_for.html">issued by</a> [AL report] Justice Clarence Thomas and noted that Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer opposed the decision. Melson challenged the use of midazolam in the three-drug cocktail used in Alabama executions, arguing that it does not properly insensate prisoners to the pain of lethal injection. Melson was convicted of the murders of three fast-food restaurant employees during a robbery in 1994. The execution is set for 6 PM Thursday at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama.</p>

<p>The death penalty continues to be a point of contention across the US. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. In April the Texas Department of Criminal Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/texas-sues-fda-to-release-seized-lethal-injection-drugs.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the Food and Drug Administration [official website] for banning a shipment of lethal injection drugs to prison officials. Earlier in April Amnesty International released an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF] revealing the US to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. However, in March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In March, Florida Governor <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Rick Scott</a> [official website] signed a <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/0280/">new bill</a> [SB 280, materials] which stated that the death penalty may only be <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused to consider</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. That same month, Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/">Connecticut General Assembly</a> [official website] on Tuesday passed <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2017/cbs/H/pdf/HB-5743.pdf">HB 5743</a> [text, PDF], an anti-hate crime bill that could be the strongest in the country. The legislation makes any hate crime an automatic felony rather than a misdemeanor. The bill is also more inclusive as to what constitutes a hate crime by adding violence or threats based on someone's gender. Additionally, the bill increases penalties for threats against certain facilities such as religious institutions and day cares. A provision for a minimum penalty of a $1,000 fine is included as well as the ability to impose relevant community service on any convicted of a hate crime. Democratic and Republican Senators voted unanimously on the new legislation which is now headed to Governor <a href="http://portal.ct.gov/governor/">Dannel Malloy</a> [official website] for consideration.</p>

<p>An increase in hate crimes has been reported around the globe. In November the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/fbi-reports-rise-in-hate-crimes-especially-against-muslims.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that hate crimes, especially against Muslims, were on the rise in the US. In the UK, prosecutors have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-urges-prosecutors-to-combat-hate-crimes-with-tougher-sentences.php">encouraged</a> [JURIST report] to use <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36875533">tougher sentences against hate crimes</a> [BBC report] in response to the nation's increasingly hostile environment since the EU referendum. Since the middle of June more than 6,000 hate crimes and incidents have been reported to the authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, presented a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session35/Documents/A_HRC_35_23_AEV.docx">report</a> [text, DOC] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] on Wednesday calling for governments to do more to reduce violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. The report <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21696&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] gender-related killings a type of arbitrary execution. While roughly 5 percent of male homicide victims across the globe are killed by family members or intimate partners, this number increases to almost 50 percent for women. It also acknowledges that gender-based violence not only occurs directly, but also through "lack of basic conditions and services that guarantee life, such as access to food, water, health services and housing." The report includes many recommendations for states to protect the right of life for women and girls, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and intersex individuals. These recommendations include adopting clear regulations and guidelines on safe abortion services, address gender stereotypes, repealing all laws that allow violence or discrimination on the basis of gender expression or sexual orientation, and include gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation in hate crime statutes. There were also recommendations to the United Nations, including recognizing that acts of omission also can result in the violation of the right to life and that gender-based killings of non-state members can also be considered arbitrary killings.</p>

<p>Many human rights organizations have called on countries throughout the world to address violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-chechen-police-attempting-to-purge-gay-and-bisexual-men-from-society.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] on the violence against gay and bisexual men in Chechnya. In March UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/unicef-calls-for-protection-of-migrant-women-in-children-on-the-mediterranean-route.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the protection of women and children on the Mediterranean route. Also i March a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Australia to combat violence against women. In November another UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-expert-urges-end-to-lgbt-violence-and-discrimination.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the end of violence and discrimination against LGBTI individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] director James Comey testified on Thursday in front of the <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official website]. During more than two hours of testimony, Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/comey-senate-intelligence-remarks.php">recounted</a> [prepared remarks] nine encounters with President Donald Trump. Comey had documented each time he met with the president in private. While he did not make any new revelations about links between the Trump administration and Russia, he did tell the committee that he believed Trump had directed him to drop the probe into former security advisor Michael Flynn and, when he refused, the president lied about Comey's subsequent dismissal and defamed the FBI. Comey said that he knew he was fired because the Russia investigation "was in some way putting pressure on" Trump. Comey recalled Trump telling him, "I need loyalty. I expect loyalty," after Comey had explained to the President that he was not on anybody's side politically and that the FBI was independent of the executive branch. </p>

<p>Trump's personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3860986/Marc-Kasowitz-statement.pdf">responded</a> [statement, PDF] to Comey's testimony by saying that Trump had been vindicated in that "the President was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference." He also rebutted Comey's "loyalty" statement saying that Trump had never said those words but "the Office of the President is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration." Kasowitz went on to raise alarm about Comey's admitted leaking of privileged communications. Comey had stated that he leaked the content of the memos he kept as record of his private communications with Trump to prompt the appointment of special counsel. Robert Mueller was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-fbi-director-mueller-appointed-as-special-counsel-in-russia-investigation.php">selected</a> [JURIST report] as special counsel shortly after. </p>

<p>Comey began his testimony stating that he was "confused" and "concerned" about the wavering explanations offered by the White House after his <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">dismissal</a> [JURIST report] in May. In an official letter of termination, Trump said that Comey is "not able to effectively lead the Bureau" and that "It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission." The letter was published in a <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3711116/White-House-Fires-James-Comey.pdf">press release</a> [text, PDF] that included recommendations for Comey's ouster from Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Jeff Sessions</a> [official website] and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer pointed to Rosenstein as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/11/the-white-house-explanations-for-comeys-firing-are-crumbling-before-our-eyes/?utm_term=.ef66699846b6">prime mover</a> [WP report] of the decision to fire Comey. In a memorandum, Rosenstein criticized Comey's decision to close the investigation into Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server without prosecution, but he never specifically recommends firing Comey. White House deputy press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said on Wednesday that Trump <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2017-05-10/white-house-clarifies-timeline-on-james-comey-dismissal">did not ask</a> [USNews report] for the recommendation but "The president had lost confidence in Director Comey, and frankly he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected." Democratic Senator of California <a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/">Dianne Feinstien</a> [official website] is skeptical of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/live-briefing-james-comey-andrew-mccabe.html">memo</a> [NYT report], saying, "The memo appears to have been hastily assembled to justify a preordained outcome." Republican Senator Richard Burr also expressed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/republican-response-comey-fired/">concerns with the timing</a> [CNN report] of Comey's firing. Last week, federal prosecutors <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/politics/grand-jury-fbi-russia/index.html">issued grand jury subpoenas</a> [CNN report] for the business records of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn who is being investigated for financial ties to Russia and Turkey. According to the CNN report, "The subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia." The Senate Intelligence Committee has requested for Comey to testify as a private citizen in a closed hearing next week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles\16a1204.htm">refused to block</a> [docket] a finding that a Texas county's bail system discriminates against the poor. Officials of Harris County <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-06-07/harris-county-wants-release-of-poor-inmates-halted">petitioned the court on Tuesday</a> [AP report] for an emergency order to block the ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] which called for the release of inmates who were incarcerated for not being able to afford bail. District Judge Lee Rosenthal of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] ruled in April that inmates who signed affidavits swearing to their financial situations could be released from the county jail as the bail system was in violation of equal protection rights and due process safeguards against incarceration without proper procedure or affording those held the opportunity to be heard. The country jail began releasing inmates late Tuesday and will continue to do so. The county will continue its appeal of the ruling.</p>

<p>The issue of finance as a factor for revocation or imprisonment is controversial. In April <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-california-bail-system-disadvantages-poor.php">report</a> [JURIST report] saying California's bail system pressures the poor into pleading guilty in order to be released from jail. Earlier in April the Supreme Court of Missouri <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/missouri-supreme-court-rules-parolees-ability-to-pay-court-costs-must-be-considered.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a parolee's ability to pay court costs should be considered. The Maryland Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/maryland-top-court-defendants-cannot-be-held-before-trial-if-unable-to-afford-bail.php">adopted a rule</a> [JURIST report] in February ending the practice of holding criminal defendants in jail before trial when they cannot afford bail. Last June a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/lawsuit-accuses-louisiana-judge-of-running-debtors-prison.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana judge of running a modern-day debtors' prison for sentencing people to jail when they could not afford fees. Last March the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/aclu-settles-debtors-prison-lawsuit-with-biloxi.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, in a lawsuit alleging that the detention of defendants unable to pay fines for misdemeanor charges exhibited deliberate indifference to their constitutional rights. Also last March the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] state court systems to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attorneys for Guantanamo detainee Abu Zubaydah have filed a lawsuit against the two psychologists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who developed the harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA, including waterboarding and sleep deprivation. The UK human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] announced the case on Wednesday. The attorneys are seeking to <a href="http://www.reprieve.org/new-us-torture-lawsuit-targets-cia-black-sites-germany-weighs-arrest-warrant/">subpoena</a> [advocacy website] the psychologists in order to uncover evidence about the American-led torture that allegedly went on in Poland. According to US law, a federal district court <a href="http://www.reprieve.org/wp-content/uploads/2017_05_22_PUB-AZubaydah-1782-Application.pdf">may</a> [discovery order, PDF] "order discovery of documents and testimony for use in a foreign proceeding from any person who<br />
resides or is found in the court's district." The case will be heard in the <a href="http://www.waed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Washington</a> [official website]. The CIA had <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CIA_SITE_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">detained</a> [AP report] the plaintiff in a secret Polish prison from 2002 to 2003 on suspicions that he was a "facilitator" for al Qaeda. Zubaydah has been held at Guantanamo since 2006. In April 2016 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-rules-lawsuit-against-creators-of-cia-interrogation-program-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that another lawsuit against the same psychologists with different plaintiffs could proceed.  </p>

<p>Guantanamo Bay <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/detail.php">remains</a> [JURIST backgrounder] a controversial issue due to allegations of torture and lack of legal rights for detainees. In January a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/district-court-judge-declines-to-intervene-for-release-of-guantanamo-prisoner.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to intervene in the release of a Guantanamo prisoner. In November then-president Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/obama-blames-failure-to-close-guantanamo-on-congressional-restrictions.php">blamed</a> [JURIST report] the failure to close Guantanamo Bay on Congressional restrictions. In August a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-throws-out-former-guantanamo-detainees-torture-claim.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a former Guantanamo detainee's torture claim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Japan's <a href="http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/index.nsf/html/index_e.htm">lower legislative house</a> [official website] approved changes to Japan's century-old rape laws on Thursday that would expand the definition of rape, lengthen prison sentences to five years and allow prosecutions to occur in instances where a victim did not press charges.  The amendments would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-rape-idUSKBN18Z0V5?il=0">redefine</a> [Reuters report] rape to include more forms of forced sexual penetration, which would acknowledge male victims. The amendment would also eliminate the requirement for "violence or intimidation" in cases where parents or guardians were sexually abusing minors. The amendments were proposed due to lobbying by victims' rights advocates. According to a 2014 study, only five percent of Japanese female victims went to the police following a rape and only one-third told anyone because of societal pressure. The amendments must now be <a href="http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/guide/legi/">sent</a> [official website] to the House of Councillors (upper house) in the next step of the legislative process.  </p>

<p>Rape and other sex crimes are frequent issues in the international legal community and have made headlines several times within the past month. In May Australia <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/australia-to-ban-pedophiles-from-traveling-overseas.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to decrease child sex trafficking by prohibiting registered sex offenders from traveling overseas. The same day, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-in-statutory-rape-deportation-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the federal age of consent was 16. Also in May Sweden <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/sweden-drops-julian-assange-rape-investigation.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] Julian Assange's rape investigation. Earlier that month, India's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/india-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-gang-rape-case.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty in the case of a gang rape which led to the victim's death. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Republican-led US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted on Thursday to lift many of the constraints that were put into place following the 2008 financial crisis. This vote is likely the beginning of a debate over deregulation of the powerful banking industry. This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr10/BILLS-115hr10eh.pdf">bill</a> [text], supported by the Trump administration, would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to spur economic growth by easing banking regulations. The bill is likely to face resistance in the Senate. Democrats and other progressive groups, who believe the banking industry requires tougher regulations, disapprove of the bill. These groups point out that banks <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-house-gop-dodd-frank-repeal-20170608-story.html">reported</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] record profits last year, despite the tough Dodd-Frank Act rule. The Act is part of the broader GOP plan to reduce the size and influence of the federal government on everyday life.</p>

<p>The US banking industry has <a href="/feature/featured/bank-settlements/">come under fire</a> [JURIST op-ed], and greater regulation, since the 2008 economic downturn. As part of greater regulation, the Obama administration developed the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB). Donald Trump began his attack on the CFPB during his campaign when he promised less regulation for businesses. In February Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-takes-first-steps-in-dismantling-dodd-frank-other-financial-regulations.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/03/presidential-executive-order-core-principles-regulating-united-states">executive order</a> and a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/03/presidential-memorandum-fiduciary-duty-rule">presidential memorandum</a> [texts] with orders aimed at an incremental dismantling of the Obama administration's financial regulations. In January the president <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-executive-order-to-cut-federal-regulations.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that requires two regulations to be eliminated for every new one created. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge on Thursday denied bail to Reality Leigh Winner, the Georgia woman who is accused of leaking classified information to the media. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/reality-winner-denied-bail-2017-6">successfully argued</a> [AP report] that she remains a flight risk and a threat to the public after presenting a notebook in which she wrote, "I want to burn the White House Down ... find somewhere in Kurdistan to live. Ha-ha!" Winner, who operated under Pluribus International Corporation in Georgia at the time she is alleged to have removed material from a US government facility, is the first person charged with leaking classified information during the Trump administration. She is <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-contractor-charged-with-leaking-classified-report.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with gathering, transmitting or losing defense material. Winner is suspected of transmitting a report to The Intercept, an online news organization. The report at issue contained information <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RUSSIA_HACKING_ELECTION?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">alleging</a> [AP report] a Russian cyber attack took place on a voting software supplier before the last US presidential election. If convicted, Winner could face up to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>Possible hackings and data breaches have caused serious concern in recent years. In March the DOJ announced the <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/doj-charges-russian-officers-for-hacking-email-accounts.php">indictments</a> [JURIST report] of four Russian nationals in connection with hacking e-mail accounts. In January a group of ten US Senators introduced <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-senate-bill-seeks-mandatory-sanctions-against-russia-for-hacking.php">legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at implementing mandatory sanctions against Russia for its involvement in cyber hacking during the 2016 presidential election. In October 2015, at the request of US government officials, Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/china-hackers-arrested-following-request-from-us-law-enforcement.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] individual hackers that allegedly misappropriated commercial secrets from US firms with the intention to sell proprietary information to state-owned entities within the the People's Republic of China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The prosecutor for the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/Main.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/otp/who-s-who/Pages/Fatou-Bensouda.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile], on Thursday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=170608-otp-stat-UNSC">renewed her calls</a> [statement] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] and the international community to support her office's efforts in tackling impunity and pursuing justice for human rights violations in the Darfur region of Sudan. Bensouda particularly urged all UN member states, specifically ones that are party to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], to arrest and surrender suspects of alleged genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur. Included among the Darfur suspects are Sudan <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16010445">President Omar Al Bashir</a> [BBC profile], Ahmad Harun, Abdel Raheem Hussein, Ali Kushayb and Abdallah Banda. Noting that there was sufficient evidence provided by witnesses that formed the basis for the issuance of multiple warrants for arrest, Bensouda stated that hopes for attaining justice for victims "has increasingly been replaced by disappointment, frustration and even anger at the slow progress in the Darfur situation. Not one of the suspects for whom warrants have been issued has been arrested and transferred to the International Criminal Court." Bensouda particularly noted Jordan's failure to comply with its obligations to arrest and surrender Al Bashir, who traveled there in late March. Renewing her commitment to obtain justice for the victims and their families, Bensouda stated:<blockquote>Accountability is a pre-requisite for sustainable peace in Darfur. My Office continues to seek this accountability. I ask this Council to fully assume its responsibilities arising from <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/85FEBD1A-29F8-4EC4-9566-48EDF55CC587/283244/N0529273.pdf">Resolution 1593</a> [text, PDF] and to support our efforts, in the interests of justice, stability and sustainable peace in Darfur ... Lest we forget; the olive branch of peace is barren without the trunk of blind justice.</blockquote>There has been significant criticism of the Sudan government in connection with the Darfur conflict, and some other countries have created controversy for their failure to comply with international laws in apprehending the suspects of the Darfur crimes. As mentioned above Jordan was noted for its failure to carry out its obligations to arrest and surrender Al Bashir in late March. In April ICC prosecutors called on judges to <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/icc-south-africa-violated-rules-by-not-arresting-sudan-president.php">hold South Africa accountable</a> [JURIST report] for failing to arrest Al Bashir when he visited the country in 2015. Since 2003 the Darfur region has faced civil unrest from conflict between the government and rebel groups. In February, UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, Aristide Nononsi, <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-rights-expert-urges-sudan-government-to-protect-civilians-in-darfur.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the Sudan government to protect civilian rights in Darfur. In January the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and international sanctions Idriss Jazairy <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-praises-us-decision-to-lift-sanctions-on-sudan.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] former US president <a href="https://barackobama.com/">Barack Obama</a>'s [official website] decision to lift all US sanctions on Sudan. In September <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that the Sudan government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/ai-sudan-government-used-chemical-weapons-against-civilians.php">used</a> [JURIST report] chemical weapons on civilians in a region of Darfur between January and September 9 2016<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's <a href="http://www.sangiin.go.jp/">House of Councillors</a> [official website, in Japanese] passed a law on Friday permitting 83-year-old <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Akihito">Tsugu Akihito</a> [Britannica profile] to become the first emperor since Emperor Kokaku in 1817 to abdicate his throne, clearing the way for his son, the 57-year-old <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Naruhito">Crown Prince Hironomiya Naruhito</a> [Britannica profile], to ascend to the throne. The upper house of parliament <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-emperor-idUSKBN19005Q">passed the bill</a> [Reuters report] with a few lawmakers abstaining from the vote. <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> [official website] noted the importance of this abdication for Japan's long history and future. The parliament will now have to work the details of the scheduling of Akihito's abdication and Naruhito's subsequent ascension to the throne, which is likely to take place in late 2018. The prime minister's cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/japan-approves-one-time-abdication-for-ruler----done.php">approved</a> the special bill last month, and it <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/japan-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-emperors-abdication.php">cleared</a> [JURIST reports] the lower <a href="http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/index.nsf/html/index.htm">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in Japanese], last week. </p>

<p>The law has created some controversy particularly since it makes no mention of potential female heirs to the throne in the future, despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/world/asia/japan-emperor-akihito-retirement-succession.html?_r=2">strong public support for women</a> [NYT report] ascending to the throne. But this is not the first time that the subject of female accession to the throne in Japan has been raised. More than ten years ago in November 2005, a government panel <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/japan-panel-backs-change-to-succession.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that Japan's succession law should be changed to allow the first-born child, irrespective of gender, the right to ascend to the throne. But late Prince Tomohito, Akihito's cousin, disapproved of changing Japan's "unique tradition and history so easily." The following month the Japanese government set to <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/japan-preparing-legislation-to-allow.php">prepare a legislative proposal</a> [JURIST report] that would have amended the country's the 1947 succession law, the <a href="http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-kunaicho/hourei-01.html">Imperial Household Law</a> [text; The Imperial Household Agency translation from Japanese], to allow female monarchs. In January 2006 then Prime Minister <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Koizumi-Junichiro">Junichiro Koizumi</a> [Britannica profile] expressed <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/japan-pm-to-introduce-bill-allowing.php">his support</a> [JURIST report] by promising to introduce the reform legislation. However, the following month over 1,000 protesters, primarily on the conservative side, gathered in Tokyo to <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japanese-rally-against-female-imperial.php">rally against the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report]. The entire episode came to an abrupt halt ten days later, despite public support for the change, when Koizumi <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japan-pm-scraps-female-royal.php">decided against submitting the bill</a> [JURIST report] to parliament in the face of strong opposition from conservative members of his own party and partly in response to the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/japan-pm-slows-support-for-female.php">news of Princess Kiko Kawashima's pregnancy becoming public</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Switzerland's <a href="http://www.bvger.ch/?lang=en">highest administrative court</a> [official website] on Friday ruled to suspend the provisions of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:41997A0819(01)&from=EN">Dublin Convention</a> [text] in relation to Hungary because of humanitarian and legal concerns over conditions. Hungary has continually been sharply criticized for its harsh treatment of refugees. The court <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/migration_court-urges-switzerland-to-review-asylum-transfers-to-hungary/43247074">stated</a> [SWI report] that the situation in Hungary is too insecure and argued that the <a href="https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home.html">State Secretariat for Migration (SEM)</a> [official website] was the only organization able to evaluate the asylum cases in Switzerland. Under the EU's Dublin Convention, member states can return asylum seekers to the country where they first applied for protection. Switzerland is not an EU member state, but it is a signatory to the accord. This ruling concerns 202 people who have been refused asylum in Switzerland under Dublin accord provisions. </p>

<p>The refugee crisis in Europe has been one of the most significant humanitarian issues in the world. Last May a UNHCR press release <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/unhcr-urges-greece-to-improve-living-conditions-of-refugee-camps.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Greece to improve the living conditions in several of the refugee camps in the country. In April several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also in April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the first deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was "riddled with an array of irregularities." Earlier in April 2016, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">advised</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's top electoral court, known as the <a href="http://english.tse.jus.br/">TSE</a> [official website], dismissed a case on Friday against President Michel Temer for alleged illegal campaign funding in the 2014 election when he was the running mate of impeached president Dilma Rousseff. The TSE <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-ruling-idUSKBN19033V">voted 4-3</a> [Reuters report] to acquit both Temer and Rousseff, which avoided the annulment of their election and the removal of Temer from office. Though the acquittal gives Temer some breathing room, a separate investigation by prosecutors is underway into Temer, which includes a secret recording of a conversation he had earlier this year with a former top executive of meatpacker JBS SA allegedly condoning paying bribes to an imprisoned former lawmaker to prevent potentially devastating testimony. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and has stated that he will never resign.</p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times as former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil's Supreme Court ordered investigations into <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">eight cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. The investigation was ordered on the tails of an anti-corruption measure that was passed last December by the Brazilian Lower Chamber of Deputies. <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/brazil-lawmakers-pass-anti-corruption-law-with-controversial-changes.php">"Operation Carwash"</a> [JURIST report] allows individuals who are subject to prosecution to seek criminal consequences against their prosecutors and judges if the officials abuse their powers. "Operation Carwash" was passed as charges have been filed against some of Brazil's most powerful politicians, including former president <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [JURIST report]. In late September former finance minister <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-corruption-probe.php">Antonio Palocci was arrested</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of late Libya leader Muammar Gaddafi, was released from prison Friday, according to the Abu Bakr al-Sideeq militia, which was held him for the past five years. Saif, 44, who was the most high-profile of Gaddafi's children, was expected to lead Libya after his father. Saif was released under a "General Amnesty Law" passed by the <a href="https://www.temehu.com/house-of-representatives.htm">Libyan House of Representatives</a> [official website]. Saif is wanted by the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for crimes against humanity. According to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a> [advocacy profile], Middle East and North Africa director at <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advoacy website], "the reported release of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi based on the Libyan parliament's 2015 flawed amnesty law does not change the fact that he is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of crimes against humanity related to the 2011 uprising." Saif's lawyer <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN192092-OCATP">told media</a> [Reuters report] that he will not be turning himself in to the ICC.</p>

<p>Saif has faced a long list of legal issues ever since the 2011 revolt. In 2013 about 30 aides to Muammar Gaddafi, including Saif, were <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/libya-court-indicts-Gaddafi-aides-for-alleged-offenses-during-2011-conflict.php"> indicted</a> [JURIST report] by a Libyan court for a list of offenses allegedly committed during the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 revolt</a> [JURIST backgrounder], including murder, kidnapping, complicity in incitement to rape, plunder, sabotage, embezzlement of public funds and acts harmful to national unity. In August 2013 Saif al-Islam and Abdullah al-Senussi <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/libya-prosecutors-to-try-gaddafi-son-spy-chief-for-murder.php">were charged</a> [JURIST report] in Libya with murder relating to the 2011 revolt. A month earlier the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-orders-libya-to-turn-over-gaddafis-son.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the country's request to suspend an order to hand over Saif to face the international charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court on Sunday awarded <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [BBC profile] and his wife, Sara Netanyahu, USD $32,500 in a libel case. The Netanyahus filed the suit against <a href="https://www.facebook.com/igal.sarna">Igal Sarna</a> [Facebook profile], who alleged in a Facebook post that the prime minister was kicked out of his car by his wife during an argument. Prime Minister Netanyahu testified at trial that the alleged incident never occurred and that "[Sarna] crossed the line." In his 55-page judgment, <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/heb/cv/fe_html_out/judges/k_hayim/156123890.htm">Judge Azaria Alcalay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/reporter-ordered-to-pay-nis-100k-for-claim-netanyahu-was-kicked-out-of-car/">stated</a> [Times of Israel report] that he believed that "the publication was, at least partially, malicious and ugly, intended to humiliate and shame the plaintiffs." Reacting to the ruling on Facebook, Sarna wrote that he intends to appeal the verdict and that "it is only the beginning of the struggle against the attempt to silence."</p>

<p>Sara Netanyahu is currently <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.722077">being investigated</a> [Haaretz report] for improper behavior and misuse of state funds. The allegations <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Police-find-evidence-of-criminal-wrongdoing-by-Sara-Netanyahu-in-PM-residence-affair-455339">include</a> [Jerusalem Post report] breach of trust, falsifying documents and receiving goods under false pretenses. The Netanyahus have denied all allegations. The investigation into spending by the Netanyahus <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/police-recommend-sara-netanyahu-stand-trial-on-graft-allegations/">began</a> [Time of Israel report] in 2015 after a state comptroller report <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/middleeast/israeli-inquiry-faults-netanyahus-over-expenses.html?_r=1">criticized</a> [NYT report] their spending habits. In 2015, Israel's attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/israel-ag-orders-investigation-of-netanyahu-expenses.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a criminal probe into excessive residential spending by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This is not the first time an Israeli prime minister has gone through a criminal investigation. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was<a href="/paperchase/2014/03/israel-ex-pm-convicted-of-bribery-charges.php"> convicted</a> [JURIST report] of accepting bribes relating to the construction of a luxury apartment complex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a non-binding referendum with only 23 percent turnout, 97 percent of Puerto Rico voters opted for statehood Sunday. Governor Ricardo Rosselló Nevares <a href="http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/gobernador-rossell-nevares-comunicar-apoyo-de-los-puertorrique-os-la-estadidad-ante-el">announced the results</a> [press release, in Spanish] Sunday and said he will communicate the results with the US Congress. The other options, independence and free association received 1.5 percent of the votes, and the current territorial status received 1.3 percent. Rosselló Nevares said:<blockquote>Today Puerto Ricans are sending a strong and clear message to the world, claiming equal rights as American citizens. It is now up to us to bring those results to Washington with the force of a democratic exercise, supervised by a National and International Observer Mission, which has validated the process as properly organized, just and democratic. This Mission will be reporting to Congress and the Federal Government on this historic election.</blockquote>Congress is the only body that can approve the new status for Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>For several years, Puerto Rico has been facing a severe financial, economic and social crisis. The territory has been suffering from a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35368786">massive recession</a> [BBC report] since 2006. The island <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/puerto-rico-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-under-special-law.php">filed for bankruptcy</a> [JURIST report] in May. The filing came under Article 3 of <a href="http://www.oslpr.org/download/en/2016/A-021-2016.pdf">PROMESA</a> [text, PDF], a special law passed last year to allow Puerto Rico to manage its significant debt. In January the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-puerto-rico-pension-bondholders-case-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a case brought by bondholders of Puerto Rico's Employee Retirement System could proceed. Also in January a UN independent expert warned that increasing austerity measures to the American territory <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-expert-puerto-rico-austerity-measures-undermine-human-rights.php">could threaten residents' human rights</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/general/cases_of_interest/17-15589%20per%20curiam%20opinion.pdf">ruled against</a> [opinion, PDF; case <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">materials</a>] the majority of President Donald Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. The ruling affirmed the majority of a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">district court injunction</a> [JURIST report] that blocked the order from being enforced. The judges affirmed the injunction on statutory grounds, finding the order in violation of federal <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text], rather than constitutional grounds. The judges wrote:<blockquote>We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress. In suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be "detrimental to the interests of the United States." Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit nationality-based discrimination and require the President to follow a specific  process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees.</blockquote>The appeals court vacated the injunction on portions of the order pertaining to interagency review.</p>

<p>The ruling is expected to be appealed to the US Supreme Court, which has also been <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-appeals-travel-ban-to-supreme-court.php">asked to review</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-blocking-trumps-travel-ban.php">similar decision</a> [JURIST reports] from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Unlike the Ninth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit rejected the order on constitutional, rather than statutory grounds. Both courts made references to Trump's own Tweets, in which he has referred to the order as a "travel ban."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, DC, <a href="http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/pages/emoluments/dc_v_trump.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Monday against US President Donald Trump, alleging that he has violated the constitution by accepting payments and gifts from foreign governments while in office. The suit claims that by retaining ownership of and involvement in his company, Trump is in violation of the <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_9_8.html">foreign</a> and <a href="http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a2_1_7.html">domestic emoluments</a> [text] clauses of the US Constitution. According to the complaint:<blockquote>President Trump's continued ownership interest in a global business empire, which renders him deeply enmeshed with a legion of foreign and domestic government actors, violates the Constitution and calls into question the rule of law and the integrity of the country's political system. Whatever the sincerity of the persons involved, foreign and domestic officials are put in the position of considering whether offering benefits to businesses associated with the President is important to maintaining goodwill. And irrespective of whether such benefits affect the President's decision-making or shift his foreign or domestic policy, uncertainty about whether the President is acting in the best interests of the American people, or rather for his own ends or personal enrichment, inflicts lasting harm on our democracy. The Framers of the Constitution foresaw that possibility, and acted to prevent that harm.</blockquote>The suit, filed in Maryland federal court, seeks an injunction to bar the president from further constitutional violations.</p>

<p>This is the third such suit filed against the president, but the first by a government entity. In January the <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-ethics-group-files-lawsuit-claiming-trumps-businesses-violate-constitution.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] claiming Trump's continued business dealings violate the emoluments clause. And in March a DC restaurant filed suit, claiming a new Trump hotel is unfair competition. Last week a group of Democratic lawmakers said they plan to file suit as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-457_6j37.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the Ninth Circuit's decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/microsoft-corp-v-baker/">Microsoft Corp. v. Baker</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on Monday, denying plaintiffs the opportunity to appeal a trial court's decision before a final judgment is rendered when the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their action with prejudice. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1291">28 USC § 1291</a> [text] gives courts of appeals jurisdiction after a final judgment is rendered at the trial level. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10031008610506396364&q=Coopers+%26+Lybrand+v.+Livesay&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1">Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay</a> [opinion], the court found that a trial court's order granting or denying class certification is not a final judgment (pursuant to 1291 requirements) and is not grounds for an immediate appeal. Following the <span class="casename">Coopers</span> decision, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23(f)</a> [text] was added to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to give appellate courts discretion as to whether to permit or deny an immediate order granting or denying class certification. In entering a judgment for Microsoft, the court held that a voluntary dismissal with prejudice is not a final judgment and does not satisfy 1291.<blockquote>We hold that voluntary dismissal essayed by respondents does not qualify as a "final decision" within the compass of §1291. The tactic would undermine §1291's firm finality principle, designed to guard against piece-meal appeals, and subvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f) put in place for immediate review of class-action orders.</blockquote>Parties denied class action certification will not automatically have grounds for immediate appeal if they dismiss their case with prejudice. If parties are denied class action certification, they will need to pursue individual claims and reach a final judgment, before they have grounds to appeal under 1291, but the appellate courts may still grant permission for immediate appeal under Rule 23(f).</p>

<p>The case was brought by Xbox 360 users who claim the video game console damages discs. The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-appellate-review-patent-exhaustion-doctrine.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in March after <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Santander Consumer USA, Inc</a> [docket] that a company may collect debts that it purchased for its own account without triggering the statutory definition of "debt collector" provided under the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [text]. The FDCPA defines debt collectors as "any person who regularly collects ... debts owed or due ... another." Petitioners argued that if Congress intended to exempt debt owners such as Santander it would have used the present partciple "owing." <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/judge-neil-gorsuch-colorado-native-washington-d-c-insider/">Justice Neil Gorsuch</a> [official profile], writing his first opinion for the court, opined that this argument "does not follow as a matter of good grammar, let alone ordinary meaning." Relying on <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographyScalia.aspx">Justice Antonin Scalia</a> [official profile], he also disagreed with petitioner's policy arguments stating, "it is not this court's role to rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text based on speculation about how Congress might have intended to address the ... purchasing [of] defaulted debt." In its ruling, Santander Consumer USA, and toher companies, are free to employ their own tactics to collect on debts bought.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1177_m648.pdf">overturned</a> [text, PDF] the Fourth Circuit's decision, concluding that the Virginia state court did not unreasonably apply the court's decision from <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-7412.pdf">Graham v. Florida</a> [text, PDF]. Under the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/ocomm/ilink/0-0-0-8598.html">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [text], "a state prisoner is eligible for federal habeas corpus relief if the underlying state court merits ruling was 'contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.'" The Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">Graham</span> held that a juvenile prisoner may not be sentenced to life without parole for non-homicide offenses, without a "some meaningful opportunity to obtain release." The state court found that Dennis LeBlanc, convicted of rape at age 16, was provided a reasonable opportunity under Virginia's "geriatric release" program, "which allows older inmates to receive conditional relase under some circumstances." Under the AEDPA, the Fourth Circuit Court reversed the state court decision, finding it an unreasonable application of the <span class="casename">Graham</span> decision. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court overturned the circuit court's ruling, stating:<blockquote>The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred by failing to accord the state court's decision the deference owed under AEDPA. Graham did not decide that a geriatric release program like Virginia's failed to satisfy the Eighth Amendment because that question was not presented. And it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that, because the geriatric release program employed normal parole factors, it satisfied Graham's requirement that juveniles convicted of a non-homicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to receive parole.</blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1191_2a34.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-0 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lynch-v-morales-santana/">Sessions v. Morales-Santana</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a gender-based differential in the US citizenship law concerning children born abroad violates the constitution. When a child is born abroad and one parent is a US citizen and the other is a citizen of another nation, the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the US-citizen parent to pass citizenship to the child if they have been physically present in the US for 10 years prior to the child's birth. This applies to married parents as well as unwed US citizen fathers. However, section <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409">1409(c)</a> [text] created an exception for unwed mothers, requiring only a year's physical presence. In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court found that this violates the Equal Protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment: "We hold that the gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that the Government accord to all persons 'the equal protection of the laws." Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined. Justice Neil Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>

<p>Luis Ramon Morales-Santana was born in the Dominican Republic to unmarried parents, his father being a US citizen. When deportation proceedings began, he challenged the statute as a violation of equal protection because if his mother had been a US citizen, she would only have had to live in the US for one year to pass her citizenship to him. Monday's ruling, however, may not aid him, as the court declined to extend the one-year exception to unmarried fathers: "We must therefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a physical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other period) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one U.S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alexei Navalny, a Russian lawyer and activist known for establishing the <a href="https://fbk.info/english/about/">Anti-Corruption Foundation</a> [advocacy wevite], was arrested outside his home in Moscow on Monday, <a href="http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/4331043">according</a> [TASS report, in Russian] to a state-media new report. His arrest, and almost immediate conviction for "organizing an unauthorized rally," occurred shortly before an anti-corruption protest targeting <a href="http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/4331043">President Valdimir Putin and the Kremlin</a> [TASS report, in Russian] was scheduled to take place on Tverskaya, a four-lane avenue and main thoroughfare in Moscow. Navalny was sentenced to a 30-day prison term. According to <a href="http://tass.ru/politika/4333576">state-run media</a> [TASS report, in Russian], Moscow officials had approved a protest in a public square just outside the city's center district, and Navalny's arrest was the result of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5vJpBd8rYM">a post he had made the night before</a> [YouTube video, in Russian] the protest redirecting protesters. Tweeting from his verified Twitter account shortly after his arrest on Monday, Navalny's wife Yulia <a href="https://twitter.com/navalny/status/874210921853448193">said</a> [Tweet, in Russian] the protest in the Tverskaya area would proceed as planned. The protest in Moscow and similar ones throughout Russia resulted in more than 1,000 arrests.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Navalny has trouble with the Russian legal system. Navalny was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/russian-opposition-jailed-for-resisting-police-orders-during-protest.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March at a demonstration protesting the alleged corruption of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev [official website]. In February he was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/russia-opposition-leader-convicted-and-sentenced-for-embezzlement.php">convicted and sentenced </a>[JURIST report] for embezzlement. That same month, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/european-human-rights-court-orders-russian-payment-to-opposition-leader.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Russia to pay more than €63,000 for arresting Navalny multiple times between March 2012 and February 2014. In May a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/russia-court-rejects-plea-to-imprison-opposition-activist-navalny.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] authorities' request to convert Navalny's suspended sentence into a prison term. He had been convicted of fraud and sentenced to three-and-a-half-years suspended sentence. In 2015 Navalny was <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/russian-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-15-days-in-prison.php">handed</a> [JURIST report] a 15-day prison sentence for distributing leaflets attempting to publicize an "anti-crisis" demonstration. In 2014 Navalny and his brother, Oleg Navalny, were <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/russia-sentences-opposition-leader-for-embezzlement.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with embezzling approximately 30 million rubles (USD $518,000) from French cosmetics company, Yves Rocher Vostok, and the Multidisciplinary Processing Company by a fraud scheme between 2008 and 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.cidob.org/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/panama/ricardo_martinelli_berrocal">Ricardo Martinelli</a> [CIDOB profile, in Spanish], the president of Panama from 2009 to 2014, was arrested in Coral Gables, Florida on Monday, <a href="https://pa.usembassy.gov/u-s-embassy-statement-detention-ricardo-martinelli-united-states/">according</a> [press release] to the <a href="https://pa.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy in Panama</a> [official website]. The arrest is the result of an extradition request by the Panamanian government made in September 2016, related to allegations that Martinelli embezzled money and spied on his political opponents while in office. The 66-year-old businessman is currently being held in a <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mim/">Federal Detention Center in Miami</a> [official website], according to the Embassy.<blockquote>Mr. Martinelli is being well-treated and has access to his legal counsel. The presentation of the extradition request by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on behalf of the government of Panama was done pursuant to the bilateral extradition treaty between the two countries. The United States maintains with Panama, as it does with sovereign partners around the world, a strong and productive law enforcement relationship, one grounded in support of the rule of law.</blockquote>An extradition hearing is currently scheduled for June 20. </p>

<p>Martinelli's arrest comes two weeks after the <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-panama-dictator-manuel-noreiga-dies-at-83.php">death of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega</a> [JURIST report]. Noriega spent the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/world/americas/manuel-antonio-noriega-dead-panama.html?_r=0">last 27 years of his life</a> [NYT report] serving prison sentences in France, the US and Panama for embezzlement, corruption and murder during his reign in the 1980s. In January he was allowed to go on <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/ex-panema-dictator-noriega-allowed-on-house-arrest-to-prepare-for-brain-surgery.php">house arrest </a>[JURIST report] to prepare for brain surgery that was necessary to remove what his doctors described as a benign tumor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled unanimously Monday in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1039_1b8e.pdf">Sandoz Inc. v. Amgen Inc.</a> [opinion, PDF] that companies applying to produce biosimilar products do not need to have the approval of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/">Federal Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] before giving notice of marketing. The case arose from an application filed by a generic drug company, <a href="https://www.sandoz.com/">Sandoz Inc.</a>, to market a "biosimilar" product to <a href="http://www.amgen.com/">Amgen, Inc.</a>'s [corporate websites] drug, filgrastim, a bone marrow stimulant for cancer patients seeking radiation therapy. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/UCM216146.pdf">Biologics Price Competition and Innovation</a> [text, PDF] subsection of the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr3590enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr3590enr.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF] requires that companies seeking to market biosimilar products must provide notice of plans to do so to their competitors "not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the [biosimilar] product licensed [by the FDA]." Sandoz sent notice to Amgen while their product was still pending FDA approval. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15-1039-15-1195-Op-Bel-Fed-Cir.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Sandoz had issued notice too early because the components of the drug, its manufacturing process and its therapeutic uses are still subject to change in order to gain FDA approval. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's decision, shortening the marketing time for generic companies.</p>

<p>This is the sixth and final patent case the Supreme Court decided this term. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-sales-in-us-and-abroad-extinguish-sellers-patent-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that restrictions placed on a patented product could not be enforced through an infringement suit because an authorized sale exhausts all rights under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/patent.overview.html">Patent Act</a> [LII materials]. Also in May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-hands-down-decision-on-what-constitutes-residence-in-patent-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tc-heartland-llc-v-kraft-foods-group-brands-llc/">TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on what constitutes "residence" in the context of patent cases. The Supreme Court has also already agreed to hear two patent cases this coming fall. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/16-712.htm">Oil States Energy Services v. Greene's Energy Group</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16-712-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case from the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the court will <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-add-patent-dispute-case-to-docket.php">determine</a> [JURIST report] whether inter partes review, a process used by the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to determine the validity of existing patents, violates private property rights, granted by the Constitution, by not using a jury forum. The US Supreme Court also <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-patent-case-on-inter-partes-review.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">SAS Institute Inc. v. Lee</span> on whether third parties can petition the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to re-review issued claims and, if not patentable, cancel them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both Israel and Palestine have failed to prosecute war crimes, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session35/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session35/Documents/A_HRC_35_19_AEV.docx&action=default&DefaultItemOpen=1">report</a> [text, DOC] presented Monday to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein</a> [official profile] submitted the report, reviewing the compliance of Israel and Palestine with recommendations made by the Council dating back to 2009. Since 2009, the Council has made more than 900 recommendations aimed at improving the human rights circumstances existing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The report reviewed the status of 773 such recommendations. The commissioner raised concerns over the impunity experienced in the Occupied Palestinian Territory for abuses of international humanitarian and human rights law. Zeid condemned both Israel and Palestine for "woefully inadequate" measures taken to hold wrongdoers accountable for violations of international law, some violations of which may amount to war crimes. The report found that the overall full implementation rate to be .4 per cent by Israel and 1.3 per cent by Palestine. The International full implementation rate is 17.9 per cent. </p>

<p>Earlier this month Human Rights Watch alleged that Israel has occupied the West Bank through human rights abuses for the past <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/human-rights-watch-fifty-years-of-human-rights-violations-in-west-bank.php">fifty-years</a> [JURIST report]. In May the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-about-palestinian-prisoner-hunger-strike.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the treatment of hunger striking Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. In April the UN Secretary-General, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-disappointed-with-israel-settlement-decision.php">expressed his discontent</a> [JURIST report] with Israel's latest decision to build settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and repeated his previous calls for a two-state solution to resolve the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In March Israel's Security Cabinet voted unanimously to approve the first settlement in the West Bank in more than <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/israel-approves-first-new-west-bank-settlement-in-20-years.php">20 years</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> testified before the <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official websites] on Tuesday in relation to his alleged ties to Russia and its coordination with President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. During the two-and-a-half-hour session, Sessions repeatedly refused to answer questions claiming a Justice Department policy protects private conversations between the president and cabinet secretaries. He also often said he "couldn't recall specifics" when asked about conversations he had previously denied having with Russian officials. When asked why he had initially stated those conversations did not take place, Sessions said that he was flustered by the questioning and misunderstood what was being asked of him. He also said that he did not <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-recuses-himself-from-russia-hacking-probes.php">recuse himself</a> from the investigations because of his <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-defends-response-to-russia-questioning-in-letter-to-senate.php">failure to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] those meetings. However, Sessions' decision to step away from the matter came the day after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">The Washington Post</a> [media website] reported on the meetings. Sessions also refused to comment on possible conversations between him and the president regarding Trump's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-fires-fbi-director-comey.php">dismiss</a> [JURIST report] former FBI director, James Comey. </p>

<p>Allegations of Russian connections have been a problem for the Trump administration since the early stages of his presidency. Last month Former FBI director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/former-fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-against-trump-administration.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Earlier in May the committee <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/senate-intelligence-committee-subpoenas-former-nsa-leader-flynn.php">issued a subpoena</a> [JURIST report] compelling former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to provide documents related to the committee's investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. Also in May former acting US Attorney General Sally Yates <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/former-ag-yates-tells-senate-she-warned-of-flynn-vulnerability.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that she had warned about Flynn's vulnerabilities to blackmail by Russia less than a week after President Donald Trump assumed office. In March now-former FBI Director James Comey <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/fbi-director-confirms-investigation-of-russia-interference-with-us-election.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the FBI was investigating allegations of Russian interference with the 2016 US presidential election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/IRL/CCPR_C_119_D_2425_2014_25970_E.pdf">found</a> [text, PDF] Monday that Ireland must remedy harm done to a woman in 2010, after denying her an abortion. Siobhán Whelan had to travel to the UK to receive medical care. Whelan was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/13/un-denounces-ireland-abortion-laws-as-cruel-and-inhumane-again">diagnosed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] with fatal fetal syndrome. The Committee ruled that the country violated the woman's right to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment after forcing her to travel to another country to undergo the procedure. Whelan's rights to equality and privacy were ruled to be infringed.</p>

<p>The preservation of human rights and equal treatment of women is an international concern. Earlier this month a UN expert presented a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-end-to-gender-based-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN Human Rights Council calling for governments to do more to reduce violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. That same day the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report]  that guarantees access to abortion. Conversely, the day before Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of abortion regulations into law. In March Human Rights Watch sent a letter and a memorandum to the speaker of the Iraqi parliament with <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-iraq-should-increase-protection-for-victims-in-proposed-domestic-violence-bill.php">recommendations</a> [JURIST report] for amendments to a proposed domestic violence bill. Also in March the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Australia on Friday to include all women in the fight to stop violence against women. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2015-0220-judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] on Wednesday that women from Northern Ireland are not entitled to abortions under the England's <a href="http://www.nhsonline.org/">National Health Services</a> (NHS) [official website]. In a 3-2 decision, judges dismissed the appeal of a mother and daughter who spent over £900 for an abortion at a private clinic. The daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, became pregnant at 15 and was not eligible for an abortion in Northern Ireland where abortion laws are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-40271763">much stricter</a> [BBC report] than the rest of the UK. Pregnancy terminations are only permitted in NI if there is a serious risk to the mother's health. There are no exceptions for rape, incest or fetal abnormalities. The mother and daughter filed suit against UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who has the ability to allow NI residents access to abortion covered by the NHS but refused to do so. Grainne Teggart, Campaign Manager for <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/issues/northern-ireland">Amnesty International in Northern Ireland</a> [advocacy website] was <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/further-blow-women-northern-ireland-amnesty-response-supreme-court-ruling-against">critical of the ruling</a> [press release], stating:<blockquote>This is a further blow to women from Northern Ireland, who already face some of the harshest abortion laws in Europe. This ruling means that women and girls from Northern Ireland will continue to be treated as second class citizens. As ever, it is the most marginalised women who will be worst affected.</blockquote>The mother and daughter have said they will take the case to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Female access to equitable healthcare services has been a contentious and evolving battle throughout the world, especially with regards to reproductive and sexual health. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-committee-ireland-abortion-law-violates-human-rights.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland must remedy harm done to a woman in 2010 after denying her an abortion. Under threat of President Trump's vow to overturn <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, the <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware legislature</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. Last June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health. The report refers to the "instrumentalization" of women in the healthcare system, in particular the "subjection of women's natural biological functions to a politicized patriarchal agenda." Earlier that month independent experts for the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">found</a> [JURIST report] a woman faced "inhumane treatment" while seeking an abortion procedure in Northern Ireland. In the press release, the experts called upon countries to more effectively balance the rights of the fetus with the rights of the woman, viewing her as more than just a mechanism for child-bearing. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-elimination-of-female-genital-mutilation-by-2030.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all countries to eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 200 Democratic Senators and House members have filed a <a href="http://theusconstitution.org/sites/default/files/Congress_Emoluments_Complaint_FINAL.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against US President Donald Trump for allegedly accepting foreign payments and gifts, breaching a clause of the Constitution. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Emoluments Clause of the Constitution</a> [LII materials] prohibits any individual holding office from accepting "any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State" without the consent of Congress. Trump, who "has a financial interest in vast business holdings around the world that engage in dealings with foreign governments and receive benefits from those governments," has admittedly "taken the position that the Foreign Emoluments Clause does not require him to obtain such approval before accepting benefits arising out of exchanges between foreign states and his<br />
businesses." Although Trump has given his adults sons <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40271172">control</a> [BBC report] over his real estate empire and other assets, he has not taken the recommendation to sell them off to avoid any conflicts of interest. Lawyers for Trump have contended that the Emoluments Clause does not apply to payments, such as a bill for a hotel room, but instead is designed to prevent the acceptance of gifts and other considerations intended to coerce or influence policy decisions. </p>

<p>This is the fourth such suit filed against the president, and the second filed by a government entity. Earlier this week the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, DC, also <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/dc-and-maryland-ags-sue-trump-for-constitutional-violations.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Trump for breaching the Emoluments Clause. In January the <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/us-ethics-group-files-lawsuit-claiming-trumps-businesses-violate-constitution.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] claiming Trump's continued business dealings violate the emoluments clause. And in March a DC restaurant filed suit, claiming a new Trump hotel is unfair competition.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sergio Cabral, former governor Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, was sentenced to 14 years and two months on Tuesday for corruption and money laundering. Cabral was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40261501">governor</a> [BBC report] from 2007 to 2014 and was instrumental in bringing the Summer Olympics to Rio de Janeiro. Cabral was <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/brazil-police-arrest-former-rio-governor-in-corruption-probe.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] in November as part of a massive corruption investigation known as "Operation Car Wash." Prosecutors accused Cabral of receiving hundreds of thousands dollars a month in kickbacks for giving construction firms lucrative contracts such as a petrochemical plant in Rio and the refurbishment of Maracana Stadium. It is estimated that the former governor had taken nearly 2.7 million reais (USD $813,000) in bribes. Also <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/brazil/la-fg-brazil-governor-20170613-story.html">sentenced</a> [LAT report] were former state Interior Minister Wilson Carlos Carvahlo and Cabral's associate, Carlos Miranda. Cabral's wife, Adriana Ancelmo, was acquitted of charges for lack of proof of her participation. Rodrigo Roca, Cabral's lawyer, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/brazilian-governor-sentenced-14-years-prison-48011906">said</a> [AP report] he will appeal the sentence.</p>

<p>Cabral is a member of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of President Michel Temer, who was recently part of a corruption probe [JURIST report] authorized by the Brazilian Supreme Court. Brazil has endured tumultuous times as former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">ordered investigations into eight cabinet ministers</a> [JURIST report] and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. The investigation was ordered on the tails of an anti-corruption measure that was passed last December by the Brazilian Lower Chamber of Deputies. "<a href="/paperchase/2016/12/brazil-lawmakers-pass-anti-corruption-law-with-controversial-changes.php">Operation Carwash</a>" [JURIST report] allows individuals who are subject to prosecution to seek criminal consequences against their prosecutors and judges if the officials abuse their powers. "Operation Carwash" was passed as charges have been filed against some of Brazil's most powerful politicians, including former president <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [JURIST report]. In late September former finance minister Antonio Palocci was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-police-arrest-former-minister-in-corruption-probe.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report]. In November Rousseff's lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">filed documents</a> [JURIST report] with the Superior Electoral Court in Brazil alleging that Temer was involved with bribery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia's <a href="http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/Welcome.aspx">Minister of Immigration and Border Protection</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/Labor's-border-bill-ticks-toward-$14-billion.aspx">announced</a> [press release] a $90 million settlement in the Manus Island class action lawsuit. The settlement includes $70 million (USD $52.75 million) to be paid to the plaintiffs and $20 million in legal costs. Australia still refutes the claims in the lawsuit and states that the settlement is not an admission of guilt. Instead, it states that the settlement is required under Australia's Legal Services Directions, which instructs to "endeavour to avoid, prevent or limit the scope of legal proceedings." The settlement must still be approved by the Supreme Court of Victoria.The class action suit <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/13/asia/australia-manus-island/index.html">involved</a> [CNN report] more than 1,900 detainees at Australia's offshore asylum seeker detention center. The refugees were at the center between 2012 and 2016. As of April of this year, 821 people are still being detained on Manus Island. It is believed that this settlement opens the possibility for more class action lawsuits, including from asylum seekers being held on Nauru.</p>

<p>In recent years, Australia has seen significant amounts of scrutiny over its refugee detention centers in Manus Island and Nauru. In February, a coalition of legal experts <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/icc-petition-accuses-australia-of-violating-refugee-human-rights.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition against Australia in the International Criminal Court, calling the detention centers a violation of human rights. Amnesty International (AI) accused Australia in October of using the island of Nauru as an "<a href="/paperchase/2016/10/amnesty-australia-using-naura-as-open-air-prison.php">open-air prison</a>" [JURIST report] to prevent immigration of asylum seekers. In August Australia <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-announces-plans-to-close-detention-center-on-manus-island.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Australia and Papua New Guinea intend on closing the controversial Manus Island detention center. That same month AI and Human Rights Watch issued <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-ignoring-inhumane-treatment-of-refugees-to-deter-others-report.php">reports</a> [JURIST report] stating that Australia is ignoring inhumane treatment of detainees in Nauru. Papua New Guinea officials claimed in May that refugees are <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">not being detained</a> [JURIST report] on Manus Island, as they are given access to mainland Australia. The statement by officials followed a ruling by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court that the Australian off-shore detention facility was illegal, in direct opposition to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the Australian Supreme Court earlier this year that the off-shore detention was legal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] started <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1607_en.htm">infringement</a> [press release] procedures against the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary on Tuesday for refusal to comply with the European Commission's emergency relocation scheme. The emergency relocation scheme was passed in 2015 to help relocate asylum seekers in Italy and Greece. In total, more than 98,000 people are meant to be relocated through the program. Every member state is expected to provide available places for relocation every three months. Hungary has not made any pledges throughout the program, Poland stopped making pledges after December 2015 and the Czech Republic stopped making pledges for more than a year. The three countries will have one month to respond to the European Commission's arguments. If the Commission finds the response to be unsatisfactory, the Commission may "send a reasoned opinion to the member states." The Commission may then also send the case tot the EU Court of Justice.</p>

<p>Several European countries have received criticism over their handling of the asylum seeker crisis. In January the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/european-commission-asylum-conditions-on-greek-islands-dire-due-to-snow.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that the conditions on the Greek islands for asylum seekers was "untenable." In March Hungary lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-detention-of-asylum-seekers.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would prevent asylum seekers from moving about the country or leaving until their claims were investigated. In October 2015 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-urges-czech-republic-to-stop-detaining-migrants-and-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to the Czech Republic to stop detaining migrants and refugees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0009-judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Wednesday that the government's policy of deporting foreign nationals who have committed crimes before their appeals are heard is unlawful. Section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act provides that a person who is not a British citizen is liable for deportation from the UK if the Home Secretary deems their deportation to be conducive to the public good. The "deport first, appeal later" policy allows the UK government to deport foreigners without giving them the right to launch an appeal against deportation while they are in the country. </p>

<p>UK immigration policies have been controversial. Last month an advisor to the EU Court of Justice concluded that the UK Home Office <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/eu-court-advisor-uk-wrongly-denied-citizenship-to-spouse-of-dual-citizen.php">wrongly denied residency</a> [JURIST report] to the Algerian husband of a dual British-Spanish citizen. In February the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/uk-supreme-court-upholds-minimum-income-policy-for-immigrant-spouses.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] immigration rules that require British citizens have a certain level of income to bring their foreign spouses into Britain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michigan <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/">Attorney General Bill Schuette</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,4534,7-164-46849-423854--,00.html">announced charges</a> [press release] Wednesday against five former Flint officials for their part in the Flint water crisis. Schuette charged Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, former Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, former City of Flint Water Department Manager Howard Croft, as well as Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Drinking Water Chief Liane Shekter-Smith and Water Supervisor Stephen Busch with involuntary manslaughter related to their alleged failure to act in the Flint Water Crisis. If convicted, the former officials could face up to 15 years in prison, and a $7,500 fine. The charges stem from when multiple Flint-area residents died of Legionnaires' disease in the time immediately following the switch from Detroit Water and Sewer Department to the Flint River. All defendants charged with involuntary manslaughter are charged in particular for the death of Robert Skidmore, 85, of Mt. Morris, Michigan.</p>

<p>In March the state of Michigan agreed to allot $87 million to <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/michigan-agrees-to-allot-87-million-to-replacing-lead-pipes-in-flint.php">replace lead water pipes</a> [JURIST report] in the city of Flint. In January more than <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/flint-residents-sue-over-delayed-epa-claims.php">1,700 residents filed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit against the US, claiming that the Environmental Protection Agency had failed to respond to damage claims arising from the Flint water crisis. These claims are some of the myriad of legal actions taken in response to the Flint water crisis. In December <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/michigan-ag-announces-charges-against-4-former-officials-in-flint-water-crisis.php">Schuette announced</a> [JURIST report] that felony charges were filed against four former state officials connected with the Flint water crisis, with maximum prison sentences of 46 years available to the prosecutors. That same month a <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/federal-appeals-court-denies-michigan-request-to-delay-water-delivery-to-flint.php">federal court affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision requiring the state of Michigan to provide bottled water to Flint residents. Last September the US Senate approved legislation to provide $100 million in emergency funding to repair pipes in cities suffering from lead contamination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The attorneys general of 11 states filed a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/energy_efficiency_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Tuesday against the Trump administration for failing to finalize energy efficiency standards for portable air-conditioners, freezers and other products. The lawsuit <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/14/california-and-new-york-just-sued-the-trump-administration-on-energy-again/?utm_term=.c2d2d2c208c1">concerns</a> [WP report] five final rules that the Obama administration issued shortly before he left office. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/11-states-sue-trump-administration-energy-standards-48014247">new requirements</a> [AP report] would potentially save consumers billions of dollars, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve a significant amount of energy. The finalized standards were subjected to a 45-day review period to ensure there were no typographical errors or inconsistencies. The <a href="https://energy.gov/">US Department of Energy</a> (DOE) [official website] has failed to publish within the public-review period rendering the new standards unenforceable under law. The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> and <a href="http://earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/nrdc-v-perry-complaint.pdf">separate suit</a> [complaint, PDF] also seeking to compel the DOE to publish the efficiency standards. </p>

<p>A priority of the Trump administration has been to roll back regulations and alter the country's energy and environmental policies, which the current administration claims have hurt jobs and the growth of the economy. In March the Trump administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-administration-requests-delay-of-appeals-court-ruling-on-clean-power-plan.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to postpone ruling on the Obama administration's climate change regulations. This request came after President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order rolling back the Obama administration policies. The <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-10-23/pdf/2015-22842.pdf">Clean Power Plan</a> [text, PDF] was challenged during Obama's presidency by certain states and industry groups that rely on the coal industry.  In February Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-legislation-rolling-back-obama-era-coal-mining-regulation.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that rolled back coal mining regulations implemented by the Obama administration. Also that week the president signed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-bill-repealing-regulation-on-energy-company-payments-to-foreign-governments.php">repeal of regulations</a> [JURIST report] that required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed orders <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-orders-to-advance-construction-of-oil-pipeline.php">advancing the construction</a> [JURIST report] of both the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Kentucky&#039;s criminal ban on medical marijuana challenged with lawsuit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three Kentuckians <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3864994/NEF-Stamped-Complaint.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday against <a href="https://governor.ky.gov/">Governor Matt Bevin</a> and <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Attorney General Andy Beshear</a> [official websites] challenging the state's criminal ban on medical marijuana. Dan Seum Jr., 59, Amy Stalker, 37, and Danny Belcher, 69, claim they <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/lawsuit-challenges-kentuckys-medical-marijuana-ban-48044761">rely on medical marijuana</a> [AP report] for relief of ailments such as chronic pain and irritable bowl syndrome. Stalker, who moved back to Kentucky to help support her ailing mother, was prescribed marijuana while living in Colorado. Since moving, she has struggled to maintain her health and seeks the ability to be able to openly communicate with her doctors as people in many other states can. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation to permit the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The suit focuses on the assertion that the medical marijuana ban violates states constitutional privacy protections between a doctor and patient. Additionally, according to the complaint, medical marijuana supplants the use of more dangerous and addictive drugs such as opioids. In 2015 Kentucky had the third highest death rate of opioid overdoses in the country. </p>

<p>As more states have enacted legislation legalizing marijuana, many lawmakers have become concerned by the anti-marijuana policies promoted by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/staff-profile/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a> [official profile]. Earlier this week, Sessions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/13/jeff-sessions-personally-asked-congress-to-let-him-prosecute-medical-marijuana-providers/?utm_term=.b1736fd2f46f">asked congress</a> [WP report] to undo the federal protections on medical marijuana. In June the <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-vote-to-prohibit-state-authorities-from-assisting-federal-law-enforcement-agenc.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday with the bare minimum 41 out of 80 votes that, if passed by the Senate, will prohibit state and local authorities from assisting federal agencies in the enforcement of marijuana laws without a court order. Before Sessions's confirmation, Hilary Bricken of the <a href="http://cannalawgroup.com/">Canna Law Group</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2016/11/Hilary-Bricken-Fear-and-Loathing.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] about how the Trump administration could impact the status of cannabis at the state level. In April, marijuana advocates at an annual gathering in Washington D.C. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522821701/legal-marijuana-advocates-are-uneasy-with-sessions-stance">discussed</a> [NPR report] their uneasiness with Sessions' positions. Elsewhere in North America, marijuana legalization has become a priority. The <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/">Mexico Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/mexico-legislature-approves-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in April allowing the use, production and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://stichtingbrein.nl/public/CP170064EN.pdf">ruled</a> [press release, PDF] that the BitTorrent sharing site, <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a> (TPB) [website], is directly infringing on copyright laws. TPB allows users to share and download movies, television shows and audio files. Unlike earlier piracy websites, such as <a href="http://us.napster.com/">Napster</a> [official website], TPB does not host files or link to them. Instead, it connects users directly to share files, most of which are copyrighted. The court held that operators of the site facilitate illegal activity by <blockquote>index[ing] the torrent files so that the works to which those files refer can be easily located and downloaded by users. "The Pirate Bay" also offers&#8212;in addition to a search engine&#8212;categories based on the type of the works, their genre or their popularity. Furthermore, the operators delete obsolete or faulty torrent files and actively filter some content.</blockquote>The ruling ends a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/15/pirate-bay-european-court-of-justice-rules-infringing-copyright-torrent-sites">seven-year legal battle</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], during which the website was blocked and seized and three of its founders were fined and jailed. In November 2014 one of the founders was <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/pirate-bay-co-founder-arrested-while-entering-thailand.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] when he was trying to cross from Laos into Thailand. Jeremy Harris, a partner at law firm Kemp Little, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-40272723">told the BBC</a> [report]: "The effect on The Pirate Bay will not be that great because it is already well blocked, but it is very significant for other sites who might do something similar and which are now potentially infringing."</p>

<p>Various countries have struggled in recent years with Internet piracy and copyright infringement. The <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] last April <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/australia-court-orders-isps-to-disclose-information-about-illegal-downloaders.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] six Internet service providers (ISPs) to hand over information about alleged illegal downloaders of the US film <em>Dallas Buyer's Club</em>. In April 2014 the Senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/brazil-ratifies-bill-on-internet-privacy.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that eliminates ISPs' liability for content published by their users and requires providers to remove offensive materials following court orders. That March Viacom and Google <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/google-and-viacom-settle-copyright-infringement-suit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a copyright infringement lawsuit that Viacom had filed against Google's YouTube website for allowing clips of Viacom's television programs to be posted without authorization. In June 2013 Russia <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/russia-parliament-approves-internet-piracy-bill.php">passed an anti-piracy bill</a> [JURIST report] that allows websites to be blocked by ISPs upon copyright infringement claims. In 2012 the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] that created a government agency with the authority to force ISPs to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyright materials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Six individuals joined with several civil rights groups, including <a href="http://www.blacklivesmatterchicago.com/">Black Lives Matter Chicago</a> [advocacy website], to file a federal lawsuit against Chicago, accusing the city police force of racial discrimination against African Americans and Latinos. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-pdf-chicago-police-reform-oversight-20170614-htmlstory.html">are seeking</a> [complaint, PDF] "a city-wide, class action injunction prohibiting the abusive policies and practices undergirding the alleged constitutional and state law violations alleged herein." The alleged violations include, among others, a system of racial discrimination within the police force, disproportionate force against African Americans and Latinos, "hand-to-hand violence," and harassment of African American and Latino minors. The plaintiffs <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-police-reform-lawsuit-met-20170613-story.html">want</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] judicial monitoring of police department reforms, as recommended by the Obama administration. The lawsuit comes after <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/supp_info/about_the_mayor.html">Mayor Rahm Emanuel</a> [official profile] sidestepped his earlier promise to have a judge monitor police reforms. Emanuel maintains that he is still committed to reforming the police department.  </p>

<p>The transition from the Obama to Trump administrations has brought changes in how the Department of Justice views police reform. In May Jeff Sessions, the attorney general appointed by Trump, <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/attorney-general-orders-review-of-police-reform-activities.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a review of police reform activities. In March Sessions <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/sessions-government-should-stop-spending-resources-on-lawsuits-against-local-police.php">gave</a> [JURIST report] his support for local law enforcement agencies against government lawsuits. In January Baltimore <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/baltimore-reaches-agreement-with-doj-on-reforming-police-department.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] an agreement with the DOJ on police reform after a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-baltimore-police-department-engages-in-discriminatory-practices.php">finding</a> [JURIST reports] in August by the DOJ that the police force had violated First and Fourth Amendment rights. In November Cleveland <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/cleveland-submits-revised-use-of-force-policy-to-federal-judge.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] a revised use-of-force policy to a federal judge after a 2014 DOJ investigation <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/doj-investigation-into-cleveland-police-finds-pattern-of-excessive-force.php">found</a>[JURIST report] the department was using excessive force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Texas <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/governor-abbott">Governor Greg Abbott</a> [official profile] signed an adoption bill into law on Thursday that allows adoption agencies receiving public funding to refuse to place children in adoptive families or foster homes that conflict with the agencies' religious beliefs. The bill <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/texas-senate-sends-religious-refusal-adoption-bill-to-governor.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in the Senate in May. The law <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB3859/2017">states</a> [text], "A child welfare services provider may not be required to provide any service that conflicts with the provider's sincerely held religious beliefs." Civil rights groups believe that this new law will be used to allow adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT parents and children and those who are religious minorities. <a href="http://www.tfn.org">Texas Freedom Network</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://tfn.org/texas-freedom-network-statement-gov-abbott-signing-discriminatory-adoptionfoster-care-bill/">said</a> [press release], "The fact that this bill is now law reinforces the reputation of Texas as a state run by politicians who are hostile to treating everyone equally under the law."  The bill's sponsor, Representative <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=69">James Frank</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-adoption-lgbt-idUSKBN19631H">denies</a> [Reuters report] that the intent of the bill was to discriminate.  </p>

<p>The rights of same-sex couples remains an ongoing issue after the Supreme Court's <span class="casename">Obergefell</span> decision. Earlier this month a lesbian <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/lesbian-appeals-mississippi-court-decision-that-she-is-not-legal-parent.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a Mississippi court decision that she is not a legal parent. In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-judge-orders-south-carolina-to-list-both-same-sex-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] South Carolina to list both same-sex parents on a child's birth certificate. In December the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/arkansas-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-birth-certificate-law.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows only the biological parents to be placed on the birth certificate, finding that equal protection was not violated by "acknowledging basic biological truths." In August New York's top court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/new-york-top-court-expands-definition-of-parent.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] the definition of "parent" to better accommodate same-sex couples. In May 2016 the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-supreme-court-vacates-ruling-refusing-to-recognize-same-sex-adoption.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption from other states. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japan's parliament, the <a href="http://www.sangiin.go.jp/eng/">National Diet</a> [official website], passed a controversial "anti-conspiracy" bill on Thursday aimed at improving security and combating terrorism. Critics of the new bill, including the <a href="https://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/">Japanese Bar Association</a> and a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur</a> [official website], worry it will be used to curb civil liberties and infringe on privacy rights. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40283730">law</a> [BBC report] amends an existing regulation against organized crime groups, which are defined as two or more people, by outlining 277 acts which can be prosecuted under the new legislation. An entire group of people may be charged if at least one member is found to have been plotting a crime listed in the bill. Although serious crimes such as terrorism are on the list, lesser offenses, including copying music, competing in a motorboat race without a license and picking mushrooms in conservation forests, also carry heavy sentences. The ruling has also been critiqued due to the bill bypassing certain formalities in order for it to be approved quickly. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19725705">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a>'s [BBC profile] ruling coalition, which <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/15/asia/japan-abe-anti-conspiracy-bill/index.html">holds the majority in the Diet</a> [CNN report], argued that the law was needed in order to improve security before the 2020 Olympics and to comply with an agreement between Japan and the UN. </p>

<p>The international threat of terrorism is of global concern. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-rights-chief-egypt-security-measures-encouraging-radicalization.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in early May that Egypt's recent security measures have been encouraging the very radicalization they were trying to control. UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism Ben Emmerson <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-expert-saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-policies-threaten-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in May that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights. The UK Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/uk-justice-ministry-to-isolate-extremist-prisoners.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] on Friday plans to separate 28 "dangerous extremist" from the main stream prison population by placing them in one of three separation centers. The UN Security Council in February <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/un-security-council-condemns-terrorist-attack-in-baghdad.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the February 16 terrorist attack in Baghdad that left at least 55 people de</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kansas Governor <a href="https://governor.kansas.gov/about-the-office/governor-sam-brownback/">Sam Brownback</a> [official profile] allowed a bill that permits public hospitals, mental health facilities and other health-providing facilities to ban concealed weapons, to become law on Thursday without his signature. <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/measures/documents/hb2278_03_0000.pdf">HB 2278 </a> [text, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/kansas-legislature-approves-bill-allowing-hospitals-to-prohibit-guns.php">passed by Senate</a> [JURIST report] on a 24-16 vote. Brownback, a strong gun rights advocate, in a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2017_18/measures/documents/hb2278_enrolled.pdf">criticized the bill</a> [text, PDF] for restricting gun owners' rights, but also noted there are safety concerns at mental hospitals by allowing guns into the facilities. HB 2278 makes permanent the exemption banning concealed weapons in healthcare facilities granted back in 2013, which was due to expire this July. Those opposing the bill, such as the <a href="https://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website], argue the ban should only apply to restricted areas inside healthcare facilities in order to uphold gun owners' right to protect themselves, especially in building without heightened security. Brownback urged legislators to later review this issue again to "find a better balance" between hospitals' safety concerns and citizens' safety concerns.</p>

<p>Gun ownership and carry rights have become an increasingly prevalent issue. In April Iowa Governor <a href="https://governor.iowa.gov/">Terry Branstad</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/iowa-governor-signs-law-expanding-gun-rights.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] expanding gun rights in the state. In March North Dakota Governor Burgum <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-constitutional-carry-handgun-bill-into-law.php">signed a "constitutional carry" handgun bill</a> [JURIST report] into law. Earlier that week, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/arkansas-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing individuals over the age of 21 to get enhanced concealed carry permits which will allow them to carry concealed weapons at public colleges, airports, polling places, sporting events, some state offices and the state capitol. In February the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/new-hampshire-lawmakers-approve-permitless-conceal-carry-bill.php">repeal the law</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting state citizens from carrying concealed firearms without a permit. Earlier in February the US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hjres40/BILLS-115hjres40eh.pdf">voted to repeal</a> [text, PDF] an Obama-era gun regulation that required mental health information to be shared with the national gun background check system. In December Ohio Governor John Kasich signed <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/ohio-governor-signs-campus-carry-bill-into-law.php">Senate Bill 199</a> [JURIST report], making it legal to carry concealed weapons at daycare facilities and onto college campuses. In March the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/us-house-approves-bill-making-it-easier-for-mentally-incompetent-veterans-to-purchase-guns.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] making it easier "mentally incompetent" veterans to obtain firearms. That same month, US President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-bill-relaxing-gun-restrictions-on-mentally-ill.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] revoking gun restrictions on those with mental illness, contrary to the Obama-era gun regulations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN-appointed panel of experts <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56982#.WUQ6BsYpDD4">released its findings</a> [UN report] from an investigation regarding human rights violations in Burundi on Thursday. According to the experts, these human rights violations include illegal executions, torture, inhumane treatment, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and detention, and orchestrated kidnappings. The experts also attest that many of these violations were committed by members of the National Intelligence Service, police, and occasionally the Imbonerakure, who are youth members of the ruling party. The investigation began in April 2015, concluding with nearly 500 testimonies of alleged human rights violations. The Commission of Inquiry on Burundi will present their final report at the thirty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council in September.</p>

<p>The controversy from President Pierre Nkurunziza's third term has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/africa/burundi">plunged the country</a> [HRW backgrounder] into a period of political violence and human rights violations. Last year, a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/burundi">report</a> [HRW report] of government forces targeting perceived opponents with threats and violence heightened. As a result thousands of Burundians have <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/05/un-agency-burundi-violence-driving-thousands-to-flee.php">fled the country</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-suspension-of-ngos-in-burundi-deeply-regrettable.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the suspension of 10 non-governmental organizations in Burundi, calling it "an attempt by Burundian authorities to silence dissenting voices." In October the <a href="http://www.assemblee.bi/">National Assembly of Burundi </a> [official website, in French] <a href="paperchase/2016/10/burundi-votes-to-withdraw-from-the-icc---dnp.php">voted to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/Home.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] after the ICC began investigating into how the government interacts with those who oppose Nkurunziza. Nkurunziza was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] for his third term July 2015 causing public protest and violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] announced in a <a href="https://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/DHS_DAPA_061517.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] on Thursday that it will keep the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [materials] program in place for the foreseeable future. DACA allows for immigrants who came to the US as children, known as "Dreamers," to obtain work permits and remain in the country legally. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/trump-will-allow-dreamers-to-stay-in-us-reversing-campaign-promise.html?_r=0">New York Times</a> [report], though, the White House and the DHS said Friday morning that the statements made regarding DACA were "intended only to clarify that immigrants enrolled in the DACA program would not immediately be affected by a separate action officially ending a similar program for the parents of those immigrants." The same memorandum rescinds another Obama-era policy, <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) [materials], which was designed to protect the immigrant parents of children who are US citizens or have permanent resident status. DAPA was <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/06/15/frequently-asked-questions-rescission-memorandum-providing-deferred-action-parents">never fully implemented</a> [DHS fact sheet] because "federal courts halted the policy." Rather than continue to defend it, the DHS formally rescinded the program. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump pledged to repeal DACA and DAPA during his 2016 campaign. As a result, both been contentious issues in recent months. In February <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/602724/john-f-kelly/">John Kelly</a> [official profile], Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/dhs-secretary-kerry-signs-memo-detailing-new-guidelines-for-deporting-illegal-immigrants.php">signed several memos</a> [JURIST report] detailing plans to facilitate the detention and deportation of immigrants in the US illegally. In January DACA-protected Mitzie Perez and the California League of United Latin American Citizens filed a <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/protected-immigrants-file-loan-discrimination-lawsuit-against-wells-fargo.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Wells Fargo alleging that the bank refused to extend Perez and other similarly situated students loans solely because of their immigration status. A Georgia state court refused to back down from its earlier ruling granting in-state tuition to Georgia university students protected by DACA. Also in January the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-house-votes-to-block-funding-for-obamas-action-on-immigration.php">passed a funding bill</a> [JURIST report] that included amendments designed to repeal key elements of DACA. A collection of mayors from major US cities, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/us-mayors-warn-trump-against-repealing-immigration-policy.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] then president-elect Trump in December about potential negative economic consequences of repealing DACA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en">Canadian Senate</a> [official website] on Friday approved <a href="http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/third-reading">Bill C-16</a> [materials], adding "gender identity" and "gender expression" to the list of federally prohibited grounds for discrimination under Canada's Human Rights Act. In an <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-justice/news/2017/06/statement_by_ministerwilson-raybouldonpassageofbillc-16insenatea.html">official statement</a> [press release] from the <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/">Justice Department of Canada</a> [official website] the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Jody Wilson-Raybould, said:<blockquote>The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that everyone can live according to their gender identity and express their gender as they choose. It will protect people from discrimination, hate propaganda and hate crimes. Once it receives Royal Assent, the legislation will add the grounds of gender identity and gender expression to the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code. Gender identity and gender expression would become prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the updates to the Criminal Code would protect trans and gender diverse Canadians who are targeted because of their gender identity or expression from hate propaganda. These changes would also require a court to treat the commission of an offence that is motivated by hate based on gender identity or expression as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.</blockquote>C-16 was introduced in its current form in May after the Senate <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/senate-approves-transgender-rights-bill-after-delay-1.3461359">took seven months</a> [CTVNews report] to study and debate the language and provisions of the bill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/875516673758986240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F4821022%2Fjustin-trudeau-canada-discrimination-gender%2F">praised</a> [Twitter post] the bill's passage in Tweet stating, "Great news: Bill C-16 has passed the Senate - making it illegal to discriminate based on gender identity or expression. #LoveisLove."</p>

<p>Many human rights organizations have called on countries throughout the world to address violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. Earlier in June Agnes Callamard, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-end-to-gender-based-violence.php">presented a report</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] calling for governments to do more to reduce violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-chechen-police-attempting-to-purge-gay-and-bisexual-men-from-society.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] on the violence against gay and bisexual men in Chechnya. In March UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/unicef-calls-for-protection-of-migrant-women-in-children-on-the-mediterranean-route.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the protection of women and children on the Mediterranean route. Also in March a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Australia to combat violence against women. In November another UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-expert-urges-end-to-lgbt-violence-and-discrimination.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the end of violence and discrimination against LGBTI individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bipartisan group of state attorneys general from Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas on Thursday announced joint <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/news-and-updates/press-releases/2017/2017-06-15-investigation-marketing-sale-opioids.html">investigations</a> [press release] into the marketing and sales practices of the manufacturers of opioid painkillers. Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/">Attorney General Maura Healey</a> [official website] stated: "The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis that is claiming lives in our state and across the country, and we want to assure our residents that we are doing all that we can to combat it." In Massachusetts the crisis claims more than five lives a day. The coalition of attorneys have not released the identities of the specific targets of the investigation at this point, but have begun issuing subpoenas for documents and gathering testimonial evidence. Illinois <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Lisa Madigan</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2017_06/20170615.html">stated</a> [press release]: "I want to know whether drug companies, seeking higher profits, have recklessly and unlawfully pushed addictive opioids." Madigan has experience going after opioid manufacturers. In 2016 she filed <a href="http://www.fdanews.com/ext/resources/files/2016/08/08-26-16-InsysComplaint.pdf?1497648431">suit</a> [Complaint, PDF] against <a href="http://www.insysrx.com/">Insys Therapeutics</a> [corporate website] for deceptively marketing an addictive opioid in an attempt to increase profits. <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/">Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton</a> [official website] <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-announces-ongoing-investigation-to-help-address-the-opioid-crisis">added</a> [press release]: "This is a public safety and public health issue. Opioid painkiller abuse and related overdoses are devastating families here in Texas and throughout the country,"</p>

<p>This development follows Ohio <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Home">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a>'s [official website] <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530929951/ohio-sues-drug-companies-over-role-in-creating-opioid-epidemic">decision</a> [NPR interview, transcript] to <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-ag-sues-drug-manufacturers-for-fueling-painkiller-addiction.php">file suit</a> [JURIST report] late last month against five drug manufacturers for misrepresenting the risks of opioids. The crisis has risen to the level of a national epidemic in recent years, in turn eliciting a variety of responses from different authorities across the nation. In March <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] establishing a task force to combat the opioid crisis. This would not be the first time that opioid drug manufacturers have found themselves in trouble with the law. In July 2007 the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pharma.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1185030508-pdFqUnDAEbi6OEAMOlKLXg">sentenced</a> [NYT report] three former executives of the <a href="http://www.purduepharma.com/about/">Purdue Frederick Company</a> [corporate website], manufacturer of painkiller <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111085.htm">OxyContin</a> [FDA materials], to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service in drug treatment programs. The three executives, including former president Michael Friedman, former chief in-house counsel Howard Udell, and former medical director Paul Goldenheim, all <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oxycontin-maker-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 to a misdemeanor offense of misbranding a drug. Prosecutors had alleged that the company and executives were aware in 1995 that doctors were concerned about the drug's high addiction risk, but its sales representatives continued to misrepresent OxyContin's effects to physicians. Purdue Frederick agreed to pay $634.5 million in fines for its role in misleading the public. OxyContin, which is a <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/2108cfrt.htm">Schedule II controlled substance</a> [DOJ backgrounder], has become increasingly abused because its time-release mechanism can be easily disrupted for illicit use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">Donald Trump</a> [official profile] signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/15/presidential-executive-order-expanding-apprenticeships-america">executive order</a> [text] on Thursday, titled "Expanding Apprenticeships in America," shifting the federal government's responsibility of creating and monitoring apprenticeship programs to third party private entities such as businesses, nonprofit organizations, and unions. Under this new system, the third party entities can set their own standards for success and submit their metrics for approval to the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> [official website]. Stressing the high cost of higher education in today's economy, the order stated that "Far too many individuals today find themselves with crushing student debt and no direct connection to jobs." Toward this end, the order explained the new federal government policy to "provide more affordable pathways to secure, high paying jobs by promoting apprenticeships and effective workforce development programs, while easing the regulatory burden on such programs and reducing or eliminating taxpayer support for ineffective workforce development programs." The order seeks to expand access to pre-internships for different groups such as high school students, formerly incarcerated individuals, members of the military, and individuals currently not attending high school or a post-secondary educational institution. The order also seeks to work apprenticeships into the curriculum for both 2 and 4 year secondary educational institutions. Additionally, the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor are required by this order to promote apprenticeships to business leaders in various sectors including manufacturing, infrastructure, cyber security, and healthcare. </p>

<p>It is estimated that this order will <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/15/trump-apprenticeship-executive-order-239590">double the amount of money</a> [Politico report] for apprenticeship grants from $90 million to $200 million a year, which is in direct contradiction to Trump's proposed budget imposing a 36% cut to the labor department's job training programs. Former Deputy Secretary of Labor under the Obama Administration, Christopher Lu, criticized the order stating that the said doubling of apprenticeship grants would require "a funding shift from other training programs" because the president's 2018 funding request "is flat." Lu added that the order will remove government oversight of apprenticeship standards, consequently reducing the quality of the apprenticeship programs. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/budget.pdf">Trump's 2018 budget</a> [PDF], titled "A New Foundation For American Greatness," delivered to Congress late last month, has independently come under heavy fire due to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/22/trump-budget-seeks-huge-cuts-to-disease-prevention-and-medical-research-departments/?utm_term=.1adf5311287d">massive cuts</a> [WP report] to medical and scientific research, disease prevention programs, education, and health insurance for children. These cuts have prompted the <a href="http://www.usccr.gov/index.php">US Commission on Civil Rights</a> [official website], the federal civil rights watchdog, to <a href="http://www.usccr.gov/press/2017/06-16-Efficacy-of-Federal-Civil-Rights-Enforcement.pdf">launch</a> [press release, PDF] "a comprehensive two-year assessment of federal civil rights enforcement," which will conclude in 2019. The purpose of this review is to "examine the degree to which current budgets and staffing levels allow civil rights offices to perform their statutory and regulatory functions, the management practices in place in the offices and whether these practices are sufficient to meet the volume of civil rights issues within the offices&#8217; jurisdiction, and the efficacy of recent resolution efforts from the offices."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A special anti-terrorism court in Mumbai, India found <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/1993-mumbai-serial-blasts-verdict-live-updates-tada-court-judgment-on-seven-accused-4706690/">six men guilty yesterday</a> [Indian Express report] for the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33713846">1993 terrorist bombings in Mumbai</a> [BBC backgrounder], then called Bombay, where almost 300 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. The special court was formed under the order of the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/TADA.HTM">Terrorism and Disruptive Activities Act</a>(TADA) [official text], a controversial law that has allegedly led to the violation of human rights. The court has scheduled a proceeding for later this month to determine the sentences for the bombers. All of the individuals were charged with waging war against the nation, and five of the accused were convicted under both the TADA and for conspiracy while the sixth was found guilty only under the TADA.</p>

<p>Mumbai has been dealing with the aftermath of the 1993 bombings and the subsequent attacks in 2003, 2006, 2008, and 2011 for almost a quarter of a century. Earlier this year Pakistan authorities placed militant leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/pakistan-authorities-place-militant-leader-under-house-arrest.php">under house arrest</a> [JURIST report] for his connection to the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Saeed has been accused of orchestrating the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/asia/mumbai-terror-attacks/">2008 Mumbai attacks</a> [CNN backgrounder]. In 2009 three individuals who were convicted of the 2003 bombings were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-court-sentences-mumbai-bombers-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report]. Later that year the trial of the only gunmen to have survived the 2008 mass shooting at a hotel continued even though the <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">man confessed his guilt</a> [JURIST report] in the midst of trial proceedings. The government responded to the slew of terrorist bombings by reconsidering an anti-terror law that had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-government-urged-to-revive.php">previously repealed</a> [JURIST report] and by creating special courts like the one involved with TADA to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/india-to-use-special-courts-for-mumbai.php">speed up the judicial process</a> [JURIST report].  <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/06/response-to-nigerian-military-panel-investigating-allegations-of-human-rights-violations/">called on</a> [press release] the government of Nigeria to conduct an investigation into the actions of the military that occurred during and throughout the conflict with Boko Haram. AI issued a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AFR4416572015ENGLISH.PDF">comprehensive report</a> [PDF] in 2015 detailing the alleged abuses thousands have suffered by the hand of the Nigerian military due to the conflict, and the most recent call to action is in response to an investigative panel the Nigeria government put together that AI claims is neither independent nor impartial. Responding to a report the panel submitted, AI said: </p>

<blockquote>We stand by the findings of our research and our call for an investigation that is independent, impartial and thorough; criteria that this panel clearly does not meet. We maintain that the nine senior commanders named in our report should be the subject of an effective and independent investigation. To this end we welcome the panel&#8217;s recommendation that there should be a Presidential Commission of Inquiry into these allegations of horrific war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in north east Nigeria.</blockquote>

<p>The Boko Haram/Nigerian conflict has been ongoing for several years and has led to the deaths of thousands; <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501">Boko Haram</a> [BBC backgrounder] is a militant Islamic group, whose name means "Western Education is a Sin," and has been fighting in the interest of creating an Islamist state. In January, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/un-rights-expert-expresses-dismay-at-nigeria-bombing-of-camp-for-internally-displaced.php">sharply condemned</a> [JURIST report] the bombing of refugee camps as a means of counter insurgency against Boko Haram. In April 2016, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-urges-nigerian-government-to-find-citizens-abducted-by-boko-haram.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Nigeria government to escalate efforts to locate and rescue people abducted by Boko Haram. In February 2016 UN human rights advocates <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Nigeria government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram through military maneuvers. In October 2015 AI announced it was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-sets-up-nigeria-office-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">setting up an office in Nigeria</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights abuses. In a showing of "solidarity with the victims of human rights violations," AI has established a permanent base in Abuja that will serve as the "main base for the global movement's research, campaign and communications work" for the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cuban government on Saturday responded to President Donald Trump's  decision to reverse steps taken by the Obama administration to thaw relations between Cuba and the US. Last Friday, Trump <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/17/politics/cuba-trump-response/index.html">announced</a> that travel and commerce between the countries will be restricted until Cuba resolves its human rights abuses.  According to Trump, the Cuban government is guilty of various abuses such as the imprisoning of civilians, harboring of criminals, and support of human trafficking, forced labor and exploitation.The Cuban government responded by criticizing the US position on human rights as a double standard. The country cited "deep concerns by the respect and the guaranties of the human rights in that country, where there is a large number of cases of murder, brutality and police abuse, particularly against the African Americans; the right to live is violated as a result of deaths by firearms." Cuba called Trump's decision a significant "backward step" that uses old methods of coercion to strengthen the embargo between the nations. </p>

<p>This decision halts two years of progress normalizing relations between the US and Cuba. For a country accused of significant human right abuses, Cuba took a significant step to open itself to the world on human rights in April. An agreement was made between the United Nations and Cuba to allow a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/cuba-agrees-to-first-rights-visit-in-10-years.php"> UN investigator to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island nation for the first time in over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/16/national-security-presidential-memorandum-strengthening-policy-united">executive order</a> [materials] by Donald Trump only effects certain relations originally crated by Obama. One area unaffected by the order is the immigration policy, which ended a longstanding <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/obama-ends-longstanding-cuban-immigration-policy.php">immigration</a> [JURIST report] policy in January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/16/africa-make-girls-access-education-reality">stated</a> [HRW report] on Friday that millions of pregnant and married girls across Africa are being denied education due to discriminatory policies. More than 49 million girls in sub-Saharan African are out of primary or secondary school, with another 31 million out of post-secondary education. Early marriage and teenage pregnancy are leading factors for girls leaving school. In sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of girls marry before their 18th birthday, and in 14 sub-Saharan nations, 30-51% of girls give birth before turning 18. According to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/about/people/elin-martinez">Elin Martínez</a> [advocacy profile], children&#8217;s rights researcher at HRW, &#8220;the African continent has one of the world&#8217;s highest rates of adolescent pregnancy, but many governments insist on tackling this social and public health challenge by punishing girls and jeopardizing their future...governments should focus on helping girls prevent unintended pregnancies and support their efforts to stay in school.&#8221; In many sub-Saharan countries, girls are expelled for getting pregnant. In Tanzania, school officials even conduct pregnancy tests to determine which girls should be excluded for pregnancy. The HRW recommended that African nations properly support young mothers and provide children with sex education and youth-friendly health services. </p>

<p>The preservation of human rights and equal treatment of women continues to be an international concern. In June a UN expert presented a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/un-rights-expert-calls-for-end-to-gender-based-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] to the UN Human Rights Council calling for governments to do more to reduce violence against women and LGBTQI individuals. That same day the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. Conversely, the day before Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of abortion regulations into law. In March HRW sent a letter and a memorandum to the speaker of the Iraqi parliament with <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/hrw-iraq-should-increase-protection-for-victims-in-proposed-domestic-violence-bill.php">recommendations</a> [JURIST report] for amendments to a proposed domestic violence bill. Also in March the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-rights-expert-urges-australia-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Australia to include all women in the fight to end gender-based violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/packingham-v-north-carolina/">Packingham v. North Carolina</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] that <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-202.5.pdf">North Carolina's statute § 14-202.5</a> [text], which banned sex offenders from using commercial websites accessed by minors, violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The statute was implemented to protect young adults from predatory practices often employed by sex offenders who target minors. The court found that the statute was too broad for the purpose of preventing recidivism and that barring the usage of several websites was too prohibitive and compromised freedom of speech. Justice Anthony Kennedy stated:<blockquote>By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge. These websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard. They allow a person with an Internet connection to become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.</blockquote>Kennedy also pointed out that the Supreme Court has often "sought to protect the right to speak in" physically spatial contexts, such as parks and street corners and that "While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear. It is cyberspace - the vast democratic forums of the Internet." As one of the first cases to address the relationship between the Internet and the First Amendment, the court wanted to "exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/supreme-court-to-rule-on-virginia-school-transgender-restroom-policy.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> in <span class="casename">Packingham</span> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-social-media-use-by-sex-offenders.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in February. Lester Packingham had been a registered sex offender since 2002 when an officer doing routine searches on social media websites found a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [official website] profile he confirmed belonged to Packingham. Packingham had made a post thanking God for good fortune concerning a traffic violation, an act which was prohibited by North Carolina's statute. A jury convicted him of accessing a commercial social networking site. He appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which vacated Packingham's conviction on the grounds that §14-202.5 banned the freedom of speech and association via social media. The State of North Carolina then appealed to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, where Packingham's acquittal was subsequently reversed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1293_1o13.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lee-v-tam/">Matal v. Tam</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a law prohibiting disparaging trademarks is a violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052">Lanham Act</a> [text] provides that no trademark shall be refused registration on account of its nature unless, inter alia, it "[c]onsists of ... matter which may disparage ... persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute." The <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) [official website] denied trademark registration to Simon Tam's band, <a href="http://www.theslants.com/">The Slants</a> [band website], finding the name derogatory to Asian-Americans. In a plurality opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito, the court held, "that this provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend."</p>

<p>The case is expected to have implications for the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=redskins&amp;IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Washington Redskins trademark dispute</a> [JURIST news archive]. In June 2014 the USPTO announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/us-patent-office-cancels-washington-redskins-trademark-registration.php">cancel six trademark registrations</a> [JURIST report] belonging to the Washington Redskins. Administrative trademark judge Karen Kuhlke cancelled trademarks associated with the team's name, logo and the name of their cheerleading squad. The Washington Redskins' name was <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-rights-expert-calls-for-washington-redskins-name-change.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, who called for the team to change their name out of respect for the "historical and cultural legacy of the Native Americans in the US."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-466_1qm1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that California courts lack specific jurisdiction to hear the claims brought against <a href="https://www.bms.com/">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</a> (BMS) [corporate website]. BMS manufactures and sells Plavix, a prescription drug that prevents blood clots by thinning the blood. Nearly 700 plaintiffs, only 86 of whom are California residents, filed eight separate complaints in <a href="http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/">California Superior Court</a> [official website] asserting that the drug had damaged their health. The court looked to "settled principles" to reach its decision, stating, "In order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim, there must be an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, an activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State." BMS is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York and maintains large operations in New York and New Jersey. While BMS does engage in business activities in other jurisdictions, including California, "BMS did not develop Plavix in California, did not create a marketing strategy for Plavix in California, and did not manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval of the product in California." The amount of the drug sold in California amounts to a little over one percent of the company's total national sales. The plaintiffs contended that because BMS contracted with a California advertising company provides a basis for specific jurisdiction but the court stated that the fact "that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State." Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion:<blockquote>I fear the consequences of the Court's decision today will be substantial. The majority's rule will make it difficult to aggregate the claims of plaintiffs across the country whose claims may be worth little alone. It will make it impossible to bring a nationwide mass action in state court against defendants who are "at home" in different States. And it will result in piecemeal litigation and the bifurcation of claims. None of this is necessary. A core concern in this Court's personal jurisdiction cases is fairness. And there is nothing unfair about subjecting a massive corporation to suit in a State for a nationwide course of conduct that injures both forum residents and nonresidents alike.</blockquote>The Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-2-cases-to-docket.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bristol-myers-squibb-co-v-superior-court-of-california-san-francisco-county/">Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County</a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] in January and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-two-civil-procedure-issues.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] agreed Monday to review <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/16-1161.htm">Gill v. Whitford</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16A1149-Gill-v.-Whitford-Order.pdf">order</a>, PDF], a partisan-gerrymandering case from Wisconsin. The state is appealing the decision of a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-1161-op-bel-dist-ct-wisc.pdf">struck down</a> [order, PDF] a redistricting map that was created by the state's Republican-controlled legislature on the grounds that it was a product of partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court also put the lower court's order for the state to create a new redistricting plan by the fall on hold as per the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/16A1149.pdf">request</a> [application, PDF] of the appellants. The opinion states that Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor would have denied the application, which could be indicative of how the court will decide the case as the justices had to consider whether the state was likely to succeed on the merits when making their decision. Arguments for the case will likely be heard in November or December.</p>

<p>Voting rights and how voters are grouped and counted has become and increasingly important issue over the past year. Earlier this month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-affirms-order-finding-north-carolina-racial-gerrymandering.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision striking down a North Carolina state House and Senate redistricting effort as racial gerrymandering that disproportionately impacted black voters. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-rules-north-carolina-redistricting-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">Cooper v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that North Carolina's redistricting of Districts 1 and 12 was unconstitutional because the state "made no attempt to justify race-based districting there." In January the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/doj-sues-detroit-suburb-over-voting-rights-act-violation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Detroit suburbs over a potential Voting Rights Act violation regarding the ability of minorities to elect other minority members as council members. Earlier that week the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-ordering-special-elections-in-north-carolina.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ruling ordering the redrawing of the congressional district map and special elections to be held in North Carolina. In September several organizations filed a federal lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/georgia-voter-registration-system-challenged-by-federal-lawsuit.php">challenging Georgia's voter registration system</a> [JURIST report]. Last April the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1358_6khn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 4-2 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ziglar-v-turkmen/">Ziglar v. Abbasi</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Muslim men detained in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks cannot sue top US officials. The three consolidated cases center on the arrest and detention of Middle Eastern men illegally present in the US when they were arrested for immigration violations. The men claimed that former US attorney general John Ashcroft, former FBI director Robert Mueller and a former Immigration and Naturalization Services commissioner confined them despite allegedly knowing they had no ties to terrorism. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court noted that the men were mistreated:<blockquote>If the facts alleged in the complaint are true, then what happened to respondents in the days following September 11 was tragic. Nothing in this opinion should be read to condone the treatment to which they contend they were subjected. The question before the Court, however, is not whether petitioners' alleged  conduct  was  proper, nor whether it gave decent respect to respondents' dignity and well-being, nor whether it was in keeping with the idea of the rule of law that must inspire us even in times of crisis.</blockquote>However, the court found that plaintiffs could not bring a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/403/388">Bivens</a> [opinion] claim challenging the detention policy. The court remanded the claim against a jailer regarding detainee treatment to the lower court. The court also found that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity against claims under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1985">42 USC § 1985(3)</a> [text].</p>

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Elega Kagan and Neil Gorsuch took no part in the case. This is the third case where the court has ruled for <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15&authored=&author=&filtered=&search=ashcroft">Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive] in suits against him and other top officials for conduct following the 9/11 attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="https://ffrf.org/images/KondratyevvPensacola_OrderGrantingPlaintiffsMSJ.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that a large cross erected in a Pensacola park is in violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text], specifically the Establishment Clause. The <a href="https://ffrf.org/">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.humanistlegalcenter.org/">American Humanist Association's Appignani Legal Center</a> [advocacy websites] filed the suit on behalf of four individuals who felt the presence of the 75-year-old cross on city-owned property was offensive and alienating park visitors who do not subscribe to Christianity. Judge Vinson was reluctant to rule against the tenancy of the cross but stated "the law is the law." He cited precedent cases that support the interpretation of the Establishment Clause that precludes government endorsement for non-secular purposes and said, "The Bayview Cross clearly has a primarily&#8212if not exclusively&#8212religious purpose." He concluded, "Count me among those who hope the Supreme Court will one day revisit and reconsider its Establishment Clause jurisprudence, but my duty is to enforce the law as it now stands." The ruling imposed that the cross be removed within 30 days. The city could appeal the case to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. </p>

<p>The interpretation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause has been contested several times in recent years. In April the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ineffective-counsel-and-government-aid-to-church-programs.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trinity-lutheran-church-of-columbia-inc-v-pauley/"><span class="casename">Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer</span></a> [SCOTUSBlog materials] on whether excluding churches from neutral aid programs violates Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses if the state does not provide a valid Establishment Clause concern. In March the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-appeals-court-allows-student-prayers-at-texas-school-board-meetings.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling allowing a Texas school board to open their meetings with a student-led public prayer. A Michigan county's practice of offering Christian-only prayers at public board meetings was <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/federal-appeals-court-opening-public-meetings-with-only-christian-prayers-unconstitutional.php">found unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] in February. In September the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appeals-court-north-carolina-county-commissioners-can-open-meetings-with-prayer.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Rowan County Commissioners in North Carolina may open public meetings with prayer. In April 2016 the governor of Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/tennessee-governor-vetoes-bill-attempting-to-make-the-bible-the-official-state-book.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST, report] a bill declaring the Bible as the official state book. Also in April 2016 a California federal judge required Los Angeles County to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/california-federal-judge-orders-removal-of-cross-from-la-county-seal.php">remove</a> [JURIST report] a Latin cross from the county seal. In November 2015 a judge for the <a href="http://www.arwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas</a> [official website] ruled that a nativity scene on Baxter County Courthouse grounds <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-courthouse-nativity-scene.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In September 2015 the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit </a>[official website] ruled that a six-foot-tall statue of Jesus <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-religious-statue-to-remain-on-national-forest-land.php">may remain</a> [JURIST report] on US Forest Service land.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1116_i4dk.pdf">reversed</a> a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-1116-op-bel-6th-cir.pdf">decision</a> [opinions, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, finding that the circuit court did not have authority to review the trial court's decision where the trial court had not violated defendant's due process rights during the penalty phase of his criminal trial. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jenkins-v-hutton/">Jenkins v. Hutton</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], the circuit court had relied on the miscarriage-of-justice exception, which permits the habeas petitioner "to review a defaulted claim when there is clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional error no reasonable jury would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law." The Sixth Circuit gave two reasons for which it had the authority to review the case: (1) &#8220;the jury had not [found] the existence of aggravating circumstances"; and (2) "a court may review a procedurally defaulted claim if, 'but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty.'" In a summary reversal, the Supreme Court found the Sixth Circuit erred for two reasons: (1) "the jury had found existence of mitigating circumstances in the guilt phase of the trial"; and (2) instead of considering "whether, given the (alleged) improper instructions, the jury might have been relying on invalid aggravating circumstances when it recommended a death sentence ... the Sixth Circuit should have considered the following: Whether, given proper instructions about the two aggravating circumstances, a reasonable jury could have decided that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances." The case was reversed and remanded. </p>

<p>Percy Hutton was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted murder and kidnapping in an Ohio court in 1985. During his trial, the jury found: (1) "that Hutton engaged in 'a course of conduct involving the ... attempt to kill two or more persons"; and (2) "that Hutton murdered [one of the two men] while 'committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after ... kidnapping.'" Following a finding of guilt in the first jury trial, Hutton underwent a trial for sentencing and was sentenced to the death penalty. The jury instructions during the second trial were at issue and the Supreme Court found those jury instructions to be independent from the jury's finding of guilt in the first trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/DisappearancesIndex.aspx">UNWorking Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances</a> (UNWGEID) [mandate] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21773&LangID=E">reported</a> [press release] on Monday that The Gambia is experiencing "encouraging signs in moves to shed light on past human rights violations." In addressing the recurring enforced disappearances of many Gambians, the UNWGEID's Chair, Houria Es-Slami and fellow delegation member Henrikas Mickevicius said, "we welcome the commitments made by the Government of The Gambia to embark on comprehensive reforms, including measures to ensure truth, justice and reparation for victims, as well as prevent any recurrence of disappearances in the future." The UNWGEID also announced its support for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which the Government declared as one of the main measures to address human rights violations. </p>

<p>Human rights violations in The Gambia greatly worsened under former president Yahya Jammeh. In May the newly-inaugurated president of The Gambia, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38185428">Adama Barrow</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/gambia-presdient-releases-171-inmates-held-without-trial.php">promised to end human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in his country and ordered the release of 171 inmates who had been detained without a trial. Barrow's inauguration speech restated the emphasis he will place on human rights and the rule of law in the small west-African nation. In addition, Barrow announced that The Gambia will remain in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website], whose primary purpose is "trying individuals for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity." <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-5294_h3dj.pdf">ruled 5-4</a> [text, PDF] on Monday in favor of a man who has been sentenced to death in Alabama, holding that he had not received "the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition" as required after the 1985 case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1904002630366313299">Ake v. Oklahoma</a> [opinion]. James McWilliams was convicted of raping and killing a convenience store clerk in 1984. At trial, the defense counsel repeatedly moved to continue the court proceedings so they could have an "expert" evaluate McWilliams' psychiatric report. The judge denied the requests, telling the defense they could have until 2 p.m. on the day of sentencing to look over the report, which the defense had only acquired two days earlier. The judge, taking the position that McWilliams was faking and exaggerating his mental illness, sentenced him to death. <br />
Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out that the precedent set in <span class="casename">Ake</span> goes beyond simply examining an indigent defendant, but also requires assistance:<blockquote>We are willing to assume that Alabama met the examination portion of this requirement by providing for Dr. Goff's examination of McWilliams. But what about the other three parts? Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff's report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy. Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness. Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing himself.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mcwilliams-v-dunn/">issued</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] a strongly-worded dissent, claiming the <span class="casename">Ake</span> decision was intentionally ambiguous, and that more deference should have been granted to Alabama's Supreme Court ruling. </p>

<p>The death penalty continues to be a point of contention across the US. Earlier this month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-alabama-inmate.php">lifted the stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] granted by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit for Robert Melson, who challenged the use of midazolam in the three-drug cocktail used in Alabama executions, arguing that it does not properly insensate prisoners to the pain of lethal injection. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill </a>[JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. In April the Texas Department of Criminal Justice <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/texas-sues-fda-to-release-seized-lethal-injection-drugs.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the Food and Drug Administration for banning a shipment of lethal injection drugs to prison officials. Earlier in April Amnesty International released an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/5740/2017/en/">annual report</a> [text, PDF] revealing the US to not be among the world's top five executioners since 2006. However, in March the Mississippi house <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/mississippi-house-approves-bill-to-allow-firing-squad-executions.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing firing squad executions. In March, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2017/0280/">new bill</a> [SB 280, materials] which stated that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury. In January Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] issued a landmark <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/S17A0196.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] Monday, holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/court-information/biographies/justice-keith-r-blackwell/">Justice Blackwell</a> [official profile] began the 71-page opinion by writing "Simply put, the constitutional doctrine of sovereign immunity forbids our courts to entertain a lawsuit against the State without its consent," before going into a history of the doctrine that goes back to English common law, and the notion that <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/special-reports/sweeping-ruling-says-state-cannot-sued-without-its-consent/MzWbabK9ynereDP1ASItjJ/">"the King can do no wrong"</a> [AJC report]. At issue in the case was <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20112012/127778.pdf">House Bill 954</a> [text, PDF], the so-called "fetal pain" law, a bill that was passed in 2012 that makes most abortions illegal 20 weeks into a pregnancy. The plaintiffs are three OB-GYN physicians who claim the law violates numerous provisions of the state constitution. The court declined to consider the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, citing sovereign immunity.<blockquote>[U]nless the State has consented to this lawsuit, it is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Consent to suit can only be given by the constitution itself or by an act of the General Assembly. The parties here point to no statutory law that works a specific waiver of sovereign immunity for suits like this one, and so, the dispositive question is whether the Constitution of 1983 authorizes such a suit. The plaintiff-physicians say that it does. They are incorrect.</blockquote>Access to abortion has been a recent issue since President Donald Trump vowed to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade. Earlier this month the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. The same day, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a series of <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">abortion regulations into law</a> [JURIST report]. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. In February the US House of Representatives approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and passed a <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. In February the Pennsylvania Senate approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{"itemid":["001-174422"]}">ruled</a> [judgment] Tuesday that a Russian law prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality is discriminatory and violates the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials, PDF]. The suit was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/russia-gay-rights-activist-challenges-homosexual-propaganda-law.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] by three activists&#8212;Nikolai Bayev, 42; Aleksei Kiselev, 33; and Nikolai Alekseyev, 39 &#8212; who were arrested and fined for carrying banners stating "homosexuality is natural, not a perversion" during staged demonstrations between 2009 and 2012. The so-called "gay propaganda law," <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced in 2012</a> [JURIST report], is a series of statutes that make any act that could be considered "promoting non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors a criminal offense punishable by a fine. Russia's Duma justified the measures as necessary to protect children from homosexual influence. The European Court's ruling, which <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf?library=ECHR&id=003-5755355-7315126&filename=Judgment%20Bayev%20and%20Others%20v.%20Russia%20-%20legislation%20banning%20the%20promotion%20of%20homosexuality.pdf">focused</a> [press release, PDF] on the freedom of expression and prohibition of discrimination, contended Russia's assertion that the laws were implemented to prevent children from being "converted" by stating: <blockquote>the Court found that the Government had been unable to provide any explanation of the mechanism by which a minor could be enticed into "[a] homosexual lifestyle", let alone science-based evidence that one's sexual orientation or identity was susceptible to change under external influence. Moreover, in staging their demonstrations, the applicants had not sought to interact with minors, nor intrude into their private space. Nothing on their banners had been inaccurate, sexually explicit or aggressive; nor could their messages have been interpreted as an invitation for tuition on gender issues. Indeed, to the extent that the minors who witnessed the applicants' campaign had been exposed to ideas of diversity, equality and tolerance, the adoption of those views could only be conducive to social cohesion.</blockquote> The court ruled in favor of the activists 6-1. Judge Dmitry Dedov, the only Russian judge, dissented stating, "the right to freedom of expression could be limited if it conflicts" with the rights of others such as "privacy (including the dignity and integrity) of the children and the convictions of their parents as to how their children should organize their family life."</p>

<p>Russia's treatment of the LGBTQ community has faced intense scrutiny in the past few months with many human rights groups focusing on the conditions in Chechnya. In May a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/hrw-chechen-police-attempting-to-purge-gay-and-bisexual-men-from-society.php">report</a> [JURIST report] stated that Chechen police have rounded up, beaten and humiliated dozens of men who are suspected of being gay or bisexual in an attempt to purge them from society. News of the conditions faced by those perceived to be apart of the LGBT community in Chechnya was first reported by <a href="http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/novaya_gazeta_-_unofficial_translation.pdf">Novaya Gazeta</a> [report, translated]. In April Chechen authorities denied that gay people live in Chechnya, which was concerning to UN experts. In July the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-human-rights-council-votes-to-appoint-expert-on-lgbt-rights.php">voted in favor of</a> [JURIST report] appointing an independent expert to report on and investigate worldwide violence and discrimination against the LGBT community. Since then, UN human rights expert have provided reports of other countries dictating their discriminatory policies against the LGBT community, such as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-rights-expert-urges-end-to-lgbt-violence-and-discrimination.php">report</a> [JURIST report] on conduct in Thailand in November. That same month, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/un-experts-concern-grows-over-attempted-block-of-lgbt-rights-monitor.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over countries attempting to retroactively block a mandate of an independent expert to investigate sexual orientation and gender identity-based rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's <a href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/">Serious Fraud Office</a> (SFO) [official website] <a href="ps://www.sfo.gov.uk/2017/06/20/sfo-charges-in-barclays-qatar-capital-raising-case/">charged</a> [press release] <a href="https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/index.html">Barclays</a> [corporate website] and four of its former executives on Tuesday with conspiracy to commit fraud and violation of the Companies Act of 1985 by providing unlawful financial assistance. The case concerns agreements between Barclay's and Qatari investors during the 2008 financial crisis. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-qatar-charges-idUSKBN19B0IJ">Reuters</a> [report], "Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 5.3 billion pounds in Barclays." Barclays accepted the funds to avoid government bailouts during the economic decline. Authorities are investigating whether those funds were properly and honestly disclosed. Currently, "Barclays is considering its position in relation to these developments," the bank stated in a <a href="http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/BARC/13266200.html">press release</a> [PDF]. The four individuals face a maximum sentence of 10 years for each charge of fraud and Barclays will be heavily fined. The men will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on July 3. Qatar, a major UK investor, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>This is not the first legal challenge Barclays has faced recently. In December the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/us-department-of-justice-files-civil-suit-against-barclays-bank.php">filed a civil suit</a> [JURIST report] against Barclays Bank [official website] and two former executives for the fraudulent sales of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, several other banks have been <a href="/feature/featured/bank-settlements/">under scrutiny</a> [JURIST backgrounder] since the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Late last year, Deutsche <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/doj-reaches-72-billion-settlement-with-deutsche-bank-regarding-toxic-mortgages.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a $7.2 billion deal with the Department of Justice. In September the US <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/">National Credit Union Administration</a> (NCUA) [official website] said that the <a href="http://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal.html">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</a> (RBS) [official website] will pay <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/royal-bank-of-scotland-agrees-to-pay-11-billion-to-resolve-us-mortgage-claims.php">$1.1 billion</a> [JURIST report] after it allegedly solid toxic mortgaged-backed securities. In February, <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/morgan-stanley-agrees-to-32-billion-settlement-with-state-and-federal-authorities.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $3.2 billion related to their mortgage-back securities. In July 2014 Citigroup, Inc. agreed to pay $7 billion to <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/citibank-reaches-7-billion-mortgage-securities-inquiry-settlement.php">settle a federal inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into mortgage-backed securities sold by the bank prior to the country's financial crisis. In November 2013 the DOJ announced that a <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/doj-finalizes-13-billion-settlement-with-jpmorgan-for-toxic-mortgages.php">$13 billion civil settlement</a> [JURIST report] with JPMorgan & Co. [official website] has been finalized, resolving federal and state claims arising from the bank's risky mortgage practices which helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21777&LangID=E">human rights expert warned</a> [press release] Tuesday that the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/CFIndex.aspx">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [UN materials] "must act now" to protect its population and implement justice. According to Marie-Thérèse Keita Bocoum, the expert on human rights for the CAR, armed forces are spreading throughout the country at a worrying rate and a lack of response from the government to defend civilians has led to revenge attacks, public outrage, and "cries of distress" from citizens looking to the government for protection. The announcement from the UN comes on the <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/central-african-republic-foes-sign-church-mediated-peace-accord">heels of a peace accord</a> [Reuters report] signed by the CAR and most of the armed groups, which is aimed at ending the ethnic and religious conflict that has killed thousands. The peace accord was mediated by the Roman Catholic Sant'Egidio peace group and was signed in Rome.</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president François Bozize in March 2013. Last month a new report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights claimed that human rights violations within the CAR <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-report-human-rights-violations-in-car-may-be-war-crimes.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In January Amnesty International reported that perpetrators of war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/amnesty-unpunished-war-crimes-in-car-call-for-rebuilding-of-justice-system.php">have not been prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] or investigated for their crimes. The rights organization urged that the country's justice system needs to be reconstructed and a Special Criminal Court, tasked with trying suspected war criminals, and a witness protection program must be established. In November UNICEF called for aid to approximately 1.2 million <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php">children distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled Tuesday that the state government must act as the trustee for public natural resources under the Environmental Rights Amendment. The <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/j-35-2016mo%20-%2010314240919600966.pdf#search=%22J-35-2016%22">court ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that royalties gathered from oil and gas leases on state lands cannot be used for budgetary matters and must be dedicated to conserving the Commonwealth's natural resources. The Environmental Rights Amendment was incorporated into Pennsylvania's constitution as Article I, Section 27 and states:<blockquote>The people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment. Pennsylvania's public natural resources are the common property of all the people, including generations yet to come. As trustee of these resources, the Commonwealth shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people. </blockquote>According to the court, the amendment creates a trust where the Commonwealth is the trustee, the people of the Commonwealth the beneficiaries, and the natural resources the assets held in trust. The Supreme Court went on to note that according to Pennsylvania's law in effect at the time the amendment was passed, proceeds from the sale of trust assets must be returned to the body of the trust, which, in this scenario, would mean the proceeds must be used to further preserve Pennsylvania's natural resources.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">Fracking</a> [JURIST backgrounder], or hydraulic fracturing, is a controversial method of tapping natural gas deposits with highly pressurized fluids. The method, commonly used in Marcellus Shale deposits, has raised environmental and public health concerns. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/new-york-puts-fracking-ban-in-place.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] fracking in the state in 2015. In March of that year the Maryland House of Delegates <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/maryland-lawmakers-approve-3-year-fracking-moratorium.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to place a three-year moratorium on fracking in the state. In January 2015 Scotland <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium on the granting of permits for unconventional oil and gas extraction, including fracking amid environmental and health concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21779&LangID=E">called</a> [statement] Tuesday for an independent investigation into the human rights situation in Kasai. Kasai province is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and has been the subject of UN scrutiny for three months. The High Commissioner condemned the establishment of an armed militia supported by the authorities and allegedly accompanied by state security forces and police. Zeid stated that serious abuses have been committed, including summary executions and rape. He said that mass graves have been discovered across the providence. The UN believes these mass graves were being investigated by two UN experts who were found murdered in March. </p>

<p>Violence in the Congo has plagued the nations for years. In May the President of the DRC's electoral commission <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/congo-election-group-violence-may-delay-vote.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the presidential election may be postponed due to sectarian violence. In April a spokesperson for the UN Refugee Agency <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/un-more-drc-refugees-migrating-to-angola-to-escape-violence.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that more than 11,000 refugees from the Kasai province had escaped to Angola due to violence in their province. The top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) released a <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/icc-violence-in-drc-could-be-war-crimes.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] in April alleging that recent acts of violence in the DRC could amount to war crimes. In March UN Secretary-General António Guterres <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/un-human-rights-investigators-killed-in-the-drc.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the remains of two human rights investigators were found in the DRC.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur Mutuma Ruteere <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21778&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] on member states Tuesday to do more to prevent racism, xenophobia and discrimination against migrants and Muslims. Ruteere stated that counterterrorism measures aid in influencing fear and discrimination against those of Middle Eastern ethnic origin. He also said that he has witnessed "the proliferation of anti-Muslim rhetoric" in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. At the same time, Ruteere said, pro-hate groups targeting migrants and Muslims pose barriers to human rights. Another factor the expert urged governments to be vigilant against is the tactics used by politicians to capitalize on fear of voters. Ruteere said that constituents are concerned that migrants will occupy jobs, participate in crime and endanger national identity. The expert asked members to recognize hateful sentiments for what they are and to act to prevent violence and discrimination against marginalized populations.</p>

<p>International agencies have recently warned against the growing trend of xenophobia. In June a US federal court ruled <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">against </a> [JURIST report] the majority of President Donald Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. A surge in populist leaders in Europe and the US threatens <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/hrw-world-report-populist-leaders-threaten-human-rights.php">human rights</a> [JURIST report] while inviting autocratic abuse in other nations, according to the 2017 World Report released by Human Rights Watch in January. In September 2016  a report  compiled by California State University, San Bernardino found an increase in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/research-finds-highest-increase-in-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-since-911.php">hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] in 2015, particularly among Muslims and Arab-Americans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=192054&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=848112">ruled</a> [judgement, PDF] Wednesday that vaccines can be blamed for causing illnesses even if there is no scientific proof. In a <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-06/cp170066en.pdf">press release</a> [PDF], the court explained:<blockquote>In today's judgment, the Court holds that evidentiary rules allowing the court, where there is not certain and irrefutable evidence, to conclude that there is a defect in a vaccine and a causal link between the defect and a disease on the basis of a set of evidence the seriousness, specificity and consistency of which allows it to consider, with a sufficiently high degree of probability, that such a conclusion corresponds to the reality of the situation, are compatible with the Directive. Such evidentiary rules do not bring about a reversal of the burden of proof which it is for the victim to discharge, since that system places the burden on the victim to prove the various elements of his case which, taken together, will provide the court hearing the case with a basis for its conclusion as to the existence of a defect in the vaccine and a causal link between that defect and the damage suffered.</blockquote> The decision comes out of a case that was appealed from France's <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/about_the_court_9256.html">Court of Cassation</a> [official website] regarding a man who developed multiple sclerosis shortly after being inoculated against hepatitis B. The court reasoned that the "temporal proximity between the administering of a vaccine" and the man's onset of multiple sclerosis, the lack of familial history with the disease and the "significant number of reported cases of the disease occurring following such vaccines being administered" was enough to meet the victim's burden of proof. The court also asserted that "excluding any method of proof" other than science-backed evidence would make it exceedingly difficult to establish liability and undermines the objectives of the court, "which are to protect consumer health and safety and ensure a fair apportionment between the injured person and the producer of the risks inherent in modern technological production."</p>

<p>Vaccinations and their potential harm has been a topic of debate in the US in recent years. Much of the vaccination debate revolves around the alleged link between certain vaccines and autism. Two years ago the <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/california-mandates-school-vaccinations.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] requiring schoolchildren to be vaccinated unless there is a medical reason not to do so.  In January 2015 a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-york-vaccination-requirement.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New York state rule barring unimmunized children from public schools. In May 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-on-attorneys-fees-under-vaccine-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that even for an untimely petition filed under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, a petitioner may recover attorney's fees as long as the claim was filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis. In February 2011 the US Supreme Court ruled that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">provides blanket immunity</a> [JURIST report] to vaccine manufacturers from all tort actions filed in state or federal court alleging design defects. The decision was consistent with <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-rules-vaccine-makers-immune-from-design-defect-suits.php">18 major scientific studies</a> [JURIST op-ed] that have failed to show a link between vaccines and the widely-diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder. In August 2010 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a decision finding <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-decision-finding-no-link-between-vaccines-and-autism.php">insufficient evidence</a> [JURIST report] to link childhood vaccines and autism in three cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/coa1">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/0/OpinionFiles/Div1/2017/CV%2015-0498.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that deferred undocumented immigrant students are not entitled to in-state tuition. The ruling overturns a trial court judge's 2015 <a href="https://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/MSJ_Order_050515.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that students under protection of the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [USCIS materials] program were considered legally present in the US and therefore qualified for state benefits. According to <a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/coa1/Judges/Kenton-D-Jones">Judge Kenton Jones</a> [official profile], the DACA program does not grant legal status, but allows each state to decide on optional benefits for DACA recipients. Jones said Arizona law prohibits in-state tuition from being granted to these types of individuals. Attorney General <a href="https://www.azag.gov/profile/mark-brnovich">Mark Brnovich</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.azag.gov/sgo-opinions/community-colleges-student-not-lawfully-present-us">opined</a> [text] Arizona voters were clear when they approved <a href="http://apps.azsos.gov/election/2006/info/PubPamphlet/english/prop300.htm">Proposition 300</a> [text] in 2006, which dictates that those who are not in this country lawfully should not be given public benefits. Intervening party, <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona-education/2017/06/20/arizona-court-overturns-state-tuition-dreamers/412845001/">said</a> [AZ CENTRAL report] it may be appealing the decision to the <a href="https://www.azcourts.gov/AZ-Supreme-Court">Arizona Supreme Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Which educational rights DACA program recipients are entitled to continues to be contested throughout the country. In January a Superior Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/georgia-judge-denies-states-request-to-block-in-state-tuition-for-certain-immigrants.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to place a hold on her previous ruling granting in-state tuition to DACA recipients. That same month, the <a href="http://www.usg.edu/regents/">University System of Georgia Board of Regents</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/georgia-appeals-ruling-granting-in-state-tuition-to-some-immigrants.php">appealed a ruling</a> [JURIST report] which gives in-state tuition to DACA recipients. In June the <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">passed two bills</a> [JURIST report], which, if passed by the senate, will strengthen protections for undocumented immigrant students in public schools from kindergarten through college. In earlier years, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rhode-island-school-board-decides-illegal-immigrants-eligible-for-in-state-tuition.php">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/florida-governor-signs-bill-allowing-in-state-tuition-for-undocumented-students.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] passed bills granting undocumented immigrants in-state tuition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilizn federal police announced on Tuesday that they found evidence that <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Temer">President Michel Temer</a> [Britannica profile] received bribes to help businesses. Temer has been under investigation since a wealthy businessman provided testimony implicating Temer in a bribery scandal and alleging Temer took endorsement hush money. Temer continues to deny the accusations and refuses to resign. In a report, the federal police say they have <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_BRAZIL_TEMER_CORRUPTION?SITE=INKEN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">enough evidence</a> [AP report] to warrant a formal investigation into the president by the Supreme Court for "passive corruption." The federal police also released video evidence showing the president's aide carrying a suitcase containing money allegedly taken from <a href="http://jbssa.com/our-business/beef/">JBS</a> [corporate website], a meatpacking company, to be given to Temer. The president is currently being investigated for corruption, obstruction of justice and being member of a criminal organization. If the investigation is given to the Supreme Court, Temer will be suspended from office pending a trial.</p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times during which former presidents have been caught in scandals of receiving various bribes from various businesses. Former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Brazil Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">ordered investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers  and dozen of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. In May the Brazil Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/brazil-top-court-authorizes-corruption-probe-into-president-temer.php">authorized a corruption probe</a> [JURIST report] into President Michel Temer and his alleged involvement with the bribery of a potential witness in a major corruption case. Former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">implicated in the scandal</a> [JURIST report] warranting charges to filed against him, including most powerful politicians. In November lawyers for ousted former Brazil president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dilma-Rousseff">Dilma Rousseff </a> [Britannica profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">filed documents</a> [JURIST report] alleging current President Michel Temer took a large bribe. In June Brazil's top electorial court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-top-electoral-court-dismisses-case-that-could-have-ousted-president.php">dismissed a case</a> [JURIST report] against President Temer for alleged illegal campaign funding in his 2014 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egypt's <a href="http://egyptjustice.com/supreme-constitutional-court/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] has temporarily halted decisions regarding a deal to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia until it can establish who has jurisdiction over them. The Egyptian government transferred the two islands, Tiran and Sanafir, to Saudi Arabia in April 2016, based on the belief that they had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. In June 2016 the transfer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-court-invalidates-transfer-of-islands-to-saudi-arabia.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] by a lower court in Cairo but that decision was overturned by a separate court. Last week <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/home/">Egypt's parliament</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-saudi-islands-idUSKBN1951G4">agreed</a> [Reuters report] to go through with the plan despite public criticism. Both the Egyptian and Saudi governments say the islands, which have been under Egyptian protection since 1950, are Saudi territory. The Egyptian people, however, are eager for an economic revival after years of political upheaval and believe Egypt's sovereignty over the islands was establish before Saudi Arabia was founded. </p>

<p>The relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt has been getting closer since President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi took power in Egypt. Saudi Arabia, an ally of Egypt, has provided Sisi's government with billions of dollars in aid after he replaced <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Mursi</a> [BBC profile] of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. El-Sisi has been viewed by many in the international community as a moderate leader compared to previous Egyptian presidents who were often embroiled in scandals and accusations of corruption. Former president Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/egypt-former-president-hosni-mubarak-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] in March after six years in custody. Mubarak and other members of his administration have been consistently involved in judicial proceedings since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In October 2015 another Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/egyptian-court-orders-release-of-former-presidents-sons.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, after holding that they have completed their three-year prison sentences for embezzlement. Last November, <a href="http://www.cc.gov.eg/">Egypt's Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/egypt-court-strikes-down-former-presidents-life-sentence.php">overturned the life sentence</a>s [JURIST report] of former president Mohamed Morsi and 16 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Morsi had been <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/egypt-court-overturns-mohamed-morsi-life-sentence-161122074711134.html">convicted</a> [Al Jazeera report] for conspiring with the Palestinian Hamas and other foreign militant groups. In 2015 Egypt and Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-saudi-arabia-sign-joint-security-agreement.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to improve stability and safety in the region. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Missouri AG files suit against three opioid manufacturers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missouri <a href="https://www.ago.mo.gov/">Attorney General Josh Hawley</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2017/pdf/complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against three of the largest opioid manufacturers on Wednesday. <a href="http://www.purduepharma.com/">Purdue Pharma LP</a>, <a href="https://www.jnj.com/">Johnson & Johnson</a> and units of <a href="http://www.endo.com/">Endo International Plc</a>. [corporate websites] are accused of violating consumer protection laws by deliberately and carefully crafting a "campaign of deception." The complaint alleges that the companies employed deceptive trade practices and cited fake research to convince doctors and consumers that their products were safe despite knowing they were addictive and potentially life-threatening. In 2015, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-missouri-opioids-idUSKBN19C1VK">33,000 people nation-wide</a> [Reuters report], including roughly 500 Missourians, died from non-heroin opioid overdoses. Hawley <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article157264164.html">plans</a> [<em>Kansas City Star</em> report] to put any monetary compensation won through the suit towards drug rehabilitation and other family services for those who have been impacted by addiction. </p>

<p>Missouri is the third state suing opioid manufacturers over their sales and marketing practices. Last week a bipartisan group of state attorneys general from Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Texas announced <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/state-attorney-generals-investigate-opioid-drug-companies.php">joint investigations</a> [JURIST report] into the marketing and sales practices of the manufacturers of opioid painkillers. This development follows Ohio <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Home">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a>'s [official website] <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530929951/ohio-sues-drug-companies-over-role-in-creating-opioid-epidemic">decision</a> [NPR interview, transcript] to <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/ohio-ag-sues-drug-manufacturers-for-fueling-painkiller-addiction.php">file suit</a> [JURIST report] late last month against five drug manufacturers for misrepresenting the risks of opioids. The crisis has risen to the level of a national epidemic in recent years, in turn eliciting a variety of responses from different authorities across the nation. In March <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-combating-drug-addiction.php">signed an executive orde</a>r [JURIST report] establishing a task force to combat the opioid crisis. This would not be the first time that opioid drug manufacturers have found themselves in trouble with the law. In July 2007 the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/21pharma.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1185030508-pdFqUnDAEbi6OEAMOlKLXg">sentenced</a> [NYT report] three former executives of the Purdue Frederick Company, manufacturer of painkiller <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111085.htm">OxyContin</a> [FDA materials], to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service in drug treatment programs. The three executives, including former president Michael Friedman, former chief in-house counsel Howard Udell, and former medical director Paul Goldenheim, all <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oxycontin-maker-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 to a misdemeanor offense of misbranding a drug. Prosecutors had alleged that the company and executives were aware in 1995 that doctors were concerned about the drug's high addiction risk, but its sales representatives continued to misrepresent OxyContin's effects to physicians. Purdue Frederick agreed to pay $634.5 million in fines for its role in misleading the public. OxyContin, which is a <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/2108cfrt.htm">Schedule II controlled substance</a> [DOJ backgrounder], has become increasingly abused because its time-release mechanism can be easily disrupted for illicit use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's <a href="http://www.tsj.gov.ve/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday allowed an investigation into the country's attorney general, Luisa Ortega, for "alleged commission of serious offenses in the exercise of office." The investigation was initiated by claims from Pedro Carreño, a lawmaker from President Nicolás Maduro's political party, who has accused Ortega of being mentally ill. Ortega has recently become a vocal opponent of Maduro. Ortega has denounced crackdowns on protesters, denounced the court's efforts to remove power from the Venezuelan legislature, and challenged the legitimacy of the judges' elections. Although the country's Constitution dictates that Ortega can only be removed from office by the National Assembly, recent court decisions have been called into question. Ortega has condemned the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/world/americas/venezuela-attorney-general-investigation.html">investigation</a> [NYT report] as politically motivated.</p>

<p>Venezuela has seen significant political unrest since the December 2015 election. Earlier this month Maduro <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/venezuela-president-pledges-to-hold-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to hold a referendum on a new constitution. On April 2, Venezuela's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/venezuela-supreme-court-reverses-ruling-after-protests.php">reversed</a> a ruling made just <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/venezuela-top-court-dissolves-legislature.php">days prior</a> [JURIST reports] that effectively dissolved the country's legislature. Last November the National Assembly postponed a symbolic trial of Maduro in an effort to <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/venezuela-national-assembly-suspends-trial-against-president.php">ease political tension in the nation</a> [JURIST report]. In October the National Assembly voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuelan-lawmakers-open-criminal-case-against-president-maduro.php">open criminal impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Maduro, alleging that he manipulated the constitution to remain in power. That same month the Assembly also <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/venezuela-national-assembly-claims-president-staged-a-coup.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that there is a breakdown of constitutional order and that the government had staged a coup by blocking an attempt to remove Maduro from power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Brown-Settlement.pdf">approved</a> [order, PDF] a settlement Tuesday between the family of Michael Brown and the city of Ferguson, Missouri. The settlement was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/06/20/judge-approves-ferguson-settlement-michael-brown-family/103053130/">approved</a> [NPR report] by Judge E Richard Webber of the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official Website], and details of the settlement agreement will remain sealed. Webber stated, "disclosure of the terms of the settlement agreement could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties, or investigators." The suit had alleged violations of civil rights, improperly trainined and supervised officers, and failure to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. The original lawsuit <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/20/us/michael-brown-settlement-ferguson/index.html">sought</a> [CNN report] punitive and compensatory damages in excess of $75,000 and attorney fees.</p>

<p>Ferguson gained international attention after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. The response to the shooting set off massive protests and social unrest. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/federal-judge-dismisses-ferguson-protestors-lawsuit-against-police.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Ferguson protesters' lawsuit against police. In August a new Municipal Court judge in Ferguson ordered sweeping reforms of courtroom practices following a damning federal report of racial <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/ferguson-judge-orders-substantial-changes-to-court-system.php">bias</a> [JURIST report]. The Department of Justice report released last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-report-no-prosecution-of-ferguson-police-officer.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] the former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson from federal prosecution for Brown's death. Former attorney general Eric Holder additionally stated that the report showed that racial disparities in police practices could not be alternatively explained other than through racial bias, which he says is proven through statistics and an examination of records and emails. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Jerusalem court</a> [government website, in Hebrew] ruled on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.elal.com/en/USA/Pages/default.aspx">El Al Airline</a> [corporate website] employees cannot ask women to change seats to accommodate men. Recently there has been an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/aboard-flights-conflicts-over-seat-assignments-and-religion.html">increased number</a> [NYT report] of disruptions on flights due to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men who refuse to sit next to women for fear of inadvertently touching them during a flight. The issue, some argue, is emblematic of the growing tension in Israel between gender and religion in public spaces. The lawsuit was brought by 83-year-old retired lawyer Renee Rabinowitz after she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/middleeast/israeli-woman-who-sued-el-al-for-sexism-wins-landmark-ruling.html?_r=0">asked to move</a> [NYT report] from her business-class aisle seat when an Orthodox man complained about having to sit next to her. Rabinowitz, who escaped European Nazis as a child, was represented by <a href="http://www.irac.org/Staff.aspx">Israel Religious Action Center</a> (IRAC) [advocacy website]. El Al denied discriminating against women and argued that their reseating policies, such as being moved to be closer to a family member or farther from a crying baby, apply equally to both men and women. The court found that asking anyone to change seats because of their gender violated Israel's anti-discrimination laws. Rabinowitz was awarded 6,500 shekels (about USD $1,800) in damages. El Al has agreed to inform its staff in writing of the policy change within 45 days and provide employee training on how to handle similar situations. </p>

<p>Women's rights groups have <a href="https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/equality-religion-and-gender-in-israel">criticized</a> [Jewish Women's Archive backgrounder] Jewish law for generally favoring men. In April Israel's Justice Minister <a href="http://ayeletshaked.co.il/">Ayelet Shaked</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/israel-appoints-first-woman-to-religious-court.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that the country's Judicial Appointments Committee has approved the first female judge to a Muslim religious court. In September a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-expert-calls-for-female-involvement-in-israel-palestine-peace-process.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] increased female participation in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. In 2010 Egypt's constitutional court system <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/egypt-constitutional-court-allows-women.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] its first women judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Senate Republicans unveiled their version of a <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SENATEHEALTHCARE.pdf">health care bill</a> [text, PDF] Thursday, proposing numerous changes to the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text]. The bill will <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/obamacare-senate-bill-compare/?utm_term=.d7cc93db58f5">repeal many of the ACA's measures</a> [WP report] including the tax increases it enforced to pay for itself and <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/">Medicaid</a> [official website], essentially giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. The fines imposed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/us/politics/senate-health-care-bill.html">individual mandate</a> [NYT report] will also be eliminated. The 142-page bill is expected to be voted on next week. Many Senators have <a href="http://time.com/4827805/senate-republican-health-care-obamacare-ahca-draft/">expressed reluctance</a> [TIME report] to vote affirmatively on the bill with so little time to review all of its provisions. Amassing enough votes to pass the bill in the Senate will be a challenge, as Democrats have unanimously criticized the small committee who put the bill together behind closed doors and have openly opposed its passing. Without support from any Democrats, the bill will fail if just three Republican senators vote against it. </p>

<p>Repealing the ACA has been a significant priority for President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers. Last month the US House of Representatives voted 217-213 to repeal portions of the ACA and <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/us-house-approves-bill-to-repeal-afforadable-care-act.php">replace them</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general filed a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/democratic-ags-file-motion-to-intervene-in-aca-lawsuit.php">intervene</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit that threatens key parts of the ACA. In March an earlier version of the proposed American Health Care Act was <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-healthcare-bill-withdrawn-from-congress-due-to-lack-of-votes.php">withdrawn from consideration</a> [JURIST report] after failing to get enough support to pass. Earlier that month, Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/republicans-present-modifications-to-aca-replacement-bill.php">released two amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the AHCA in an effort to appeal to both conservative and liberal critics. Senators <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/republican-senators-propose-first-aca-replacement-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] the initial ACA replacement bill at the end of January. This came after Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-issues-executive-order-seeking-repeal-of-aca.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] aimed at repealing the ACA, shortly after being sworn in. The Senate had prepared for the repealing of the ACA earlier that month when it <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/senate-takes-first-step-to-repeal-acaa.php">voted 51-48</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the process from being subject to a filibuster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1503_4357.pdf">upheld the convictions</a> [opinion, PDF] of several men who robbed, raped, kidnapped Catherine Fuller in the District of Columbia in 1984. Twenty-five years after being convicted in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15-1503-15-1504-Op-Bel-DC.pdf">Turner, et al. v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF], Turner and several other defendants moved to have their sentences vacated on the assertion that the government violated the rule of law from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9550433126269674519&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Brady v. Maryland</a> [opinion, PDF] by withholding exculpatory evidence. The case was decided on the testimonies given by several members of the group, some of whom pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for the government. The testimonies corroborated each other with minor inconsistencies. Each of the defendants who testified attempted a "not me, maybe them defense, namely, that he was not part of the group that attacked Fuller." Approximately 11 weeks before the trial, a prosecutor learned of notes that concerned the murder, which were taken during two interviews with Ammie Davis who had been arrested a few weeks after Fuller's murder. In an interview with the prosecutor, Davis stated she only saw one person in the vicinity where Fuller's murder took place around the time she was purportedly attacked. The prosecutor admitted to not disclosing the interview because Davis was "playful" and "not serious" and that he found her to be "totally incredible." The court found that the new evidence was "not material" and held that it would not have changed the verdict. "Considering the withheld evidence in the context of the entire record, however, we conclude that it is too little, too weak, or too distant from the main evidentiary points to meet Brady's standards." Justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented stating, "Had the defendants offered a unified counternarrative, based on the withheld evidence, one or more jurors could well have concluded that the Government had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt."</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-adds-4-cases-to-docket-1.php">agreed to hear</a> the consolidated cases of <span class="casename">Turner, et al. v.

		<title>Supreme Court: naturalized citizens cannot lose citizenship based on immaterial false statements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-309_h31i.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Thursday that naturalized citizens may not be stripped of their citizenship status based on false statements that were immaterial to becoming a citizen. The court held that in order to secure a conviction for violating <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1425">18 USC §1015(a)</a> [text], the statute governing unlawful procurement of citizenship, the government must show that the alleged illegal act actually contributed to the obtaining of citizenship. In the case at hand, Diana Maslenjukan, an ethnic Serbian refugee from Bosnia, stated that her husband had evaded service in the Bosnian Serb Army when in fact he had served as an officer in the army in an application for entry into the US. Later when applying for citizenship, Maslenjukan stated that she had not given false information to authorities upon her entry into the US. In cases involving false statements, the court held that the government must prove that a defendant lied about facts that could warrant a denial of naturalization or lead to the discovery of facts that would lead to a denial of naturalization. In this case, the government found that the false statements would not have warranted such a denial. </p>

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-drug-patents-citizenship-revocation.php">oral argument</a> [JURIST report] for this case in April. Prior to the oral argument, the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/egypt-man-with-terrorist-ties-stripped-of-us-citizenship-for-lying-during-naturalization-process.php">stripped</a> [JURIST report] an Egyptian-born man with ties to al Qaeda of his naturalized US citizenship for lying during his naturalization process. In that case, the false statements were found to be material to the granting of citizenship. Deprivation of citizenship has also affected countries abroad, where in March the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/europe-rights-court-finds-against-terror-suspect-over-deprivation-of-uk-citizenship.php">found against</a> [JURIST report] a Sudanese man who was challenging the deprivation of his UK citizenship. The man in that case had his citizenship revoked after he was suspected to have made affiliations with Al-Shabaab and to have engaged in terror-related activities. In July 2016 the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/canada-supreme-court-rejects-appeal-of-decision-in-former-nazi-citizenship-case.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the appeal of a former Nazi after his Canadian citizenship was revoked numerous times. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-240_g3bi.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that where there is a public-trial violation during jury selection the defendant must demonstrate prejudice to secure a new trial if the issue is raised as an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Members of the public were not permitted to enter the courtroom during two days of jury selection for <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/weaver-v-massachusetts/">Weaver v. Massachusetts</a> [SCOTUSblog] materials because the room could not accommodate all the potential jurors. The petitioner's lawyer failed to object to a closed courtroom, a constitutional violation which the court has previously viewed as a structural error. Counsel for petitioner did not know that a closed courtroom was unconstitutional and therefore did not discuss it with his client because the events had transpired before <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Presley_v_Georgia_130_S_Ct_721_175_L_Ed_2d_675_2010_Court_Opinion?1498187601">Presley v. Georgia</a> [opinion, PDF], a case that "made it clear that the public-trial right extends to jury selection as well as to other portions of the trial." The court concluded, "petitioner has not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel's failure to object, and he has not shown that counsel's shortcomings led to a fundamentally unfair trial. He is not entitled to a new trial." Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito concurred the opinion. Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan dissented, stating, "If courts do not presume prejudice when counsel's deficient performance leads to a structural error, then defendants may well be unable to obtain relief for incompetence that deprived them of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence." The dissent concluded, "A showing that an attorney's constitutionally deficient performance produced a structural error should consequently be enough to entitle a defendant to relief."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> in <span class="casename">Weaver</span> in January and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ineffective-counsel-and-government-aid-to-church-programs.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A panel consisting of three judges from the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/154297.P.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] all but one conviction of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who was <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/former-cia-officer-sentenced-to-42-months-in-prison-for-iran-leaks.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2015 for disclosing classified information to a journalist.  The information was about  national defense strategy in Iran. The panel reversed one of the convictions on the grounds of improper venue. Sterling argued that some of the evidence had been improperly admitted by the lower court, but the appeals panel ruled that the admission was proper. Sterling still <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/appeals-court-affirms-most-convictions-of-ex-cia-officer-convicted-in-leak-case/2017/06/22/7d4f0a1e-5748-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html?utm_term=.df9628e857d4">denies</a> [WP report] that he was the one who passed along the classified information. The panel also affirmed his 42-month sentence, saying that since the sentence would have been fair for any one of the convictions, it is irrelevant that one of the convictions was dropped. A previous panel of the same court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12548990345043295654&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">ruled</a> [opinion] in 2013, regarding the same case, that there are no First Amendment protections to prevent journalists from being compelled to reveal their sources in criminal proceedings.   </p>

<p>Thursday's decision is the latest in a long line of prosecutions for the prevention of national security leaks. In 2015 a former military contractor was <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/former-military-contractor-sentenced-for-stealing-classified-files.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for stealing classified files. In August 2013 Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 35 years in prison for her disclosure of classified information to the anti-secrecy organization Wikileaks, and she has since been released. In June 2013 Edward Snowden, a former government employee and contractor, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with disclosing to newspaper reporters information about US intelligence activities that he obtained during the course of his work, raising significant First Amendment <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the Espionage Act. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/22/yemen-uae-backs-abusive-local-forces">accused</a> [press release] the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of backing "Yemeni forces that have arbitrarily detained, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and abused dozens of people during security operations." According to HRW, the UAE claims that the it provides financial and military aid to the Yemeni troops under the guise of fighting ISIS. However, HRW has traced the disappearance or arbitrary detention of 38 individuals to Yemeni troops backed by the UAE. The UAE also runs two secret prisons in Yemen, according to HRW.  In a <a href="https://apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe">report</a> [AP report] also released on Thursday, the Associated Press found at least 18 secret prisons run by either the UAE or by troops receiving the nation's support.  </p>

<p>The UAE has drawn controversy from the international community for its justice system. In November a <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/new-dubai-law-to-ensure-independent-judiciary.php">new law</a> [JURIST report] was issued in Dubai to establish an independent judiciary branch. That same month the international community <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/middleeast/dubai-british-tourist-rape-arrest-claim/">raised issues</a> [CNN report] with the Dubai justice system following the arrest of a UK woman for extramarital affairs after she had reported that she had been raped to Dubai authorities. In 2013 a coalition of international human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/human-rights-groups-criticize-uae-activists-trial.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the trial of more than 60 activists in the UAE who had attempted to overthrow the current government.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/494750/settlement-arizona-death-penalty-lawsuit-now-official">signed an order</a> [text] on Thursday accepting major revisions to Arizona's death penalty procedures. The order provides such changes like eliminating paralytic drugs for lethal injections, providing witnesses with more access to watch prisoners inside the death chamber, limitations on the department director's authority to change drugs, and time allotted to prisoners to challenge any drug changes. The changes are the result of a settlement reached in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/arizona-executions-idUSL1N1JK01F">2014 lawsuit</a> [Reuters report] brought by seven death row inmates who argued Arizona's policies were experimental and caused unnecessary suffering. The deal is the first time any state has agreed to major changes in death penalty procedures due to prisoners' complaints.</p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. In December a report by the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> [advocacy website] found that the use of <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/death-penalty-losing-traction-in-us-report.php">capital punishment in the US is at a 20-year low</a> [JURIST report]. In May the <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/">Delaware House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a>[JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. In March Florida governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">signed a new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury. In January Ohio's lethal injection protocol was <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">deemed</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. That same month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a>[JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand's parliament unanimously approved national strategy legislation on Thursday which will provide the military with political influence for at least 20 years. The National Strategy Act will <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-politics-idUKKBN19D0T8?il=0">create a committee</a> [Reuters report], led by coup leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile], that will collaborate with future cabinet members to revise national strategy plans every five years. The committee will also consist of military leaders, business and industries representatives, and other experts. Critics of the legislation say it is a way for the military to maintain influence over future governments. The military seized power in May 2014 through a coup, which it declared necessary to end the months of civil protests and an unstable government.</p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-327_3eb4.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday for an immigrant who had received poor legal advice from his counsel. The petitioner in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lee-v-united-states/">Lee v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] came to the US from South Korea in 1982 and found success as a businessman. In 2009 he was charged with possession of ecstasy with an intent to distribute. Concerned for his residency status in the US, Lee took the advice of his lawyer who told him he would not be deported if he pleaded guilty. Lee's attorney was incorrect and the conviction carried a mandatory deportation. In order to have his sentence vacated, Lee needed to show that he not only had ineffective legal counsel but that he was prejudiced because he took erroneous advice. The court recognized that "preserving the client's right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence." In his opinion Chief Justice John Roberts considered Lee's three decades in the US, during which he had established two businesses and never once returned to South Korea, as well as his naturalized parents' dependency on his care. Roberts concluded:<blockquote>Lee's claim that he would not have accepted a plea had he known it would lead to deportation is backed by substantial and uncontroverted evidence. Accordingly we conclude Lee has demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented and was joined by Justice Samuel Alito except in Part One. Thomas asserted that overturning a guilty plea "where a defendant has admitted his guilt, the evidence against him is overwhelming, and he has no bona fide defense strategy" because his attorney had not "properly advised him of the immigration consequences of his plea" is not supported by the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] or precedent.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/supreme-court-adds-4-cases-to-docket-1.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in December and <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-regarding-plea-offers-for-noncitizen-defendants-involving-deportation.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-399_5436.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that the proper review forum when the <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/">Merit Systems Protection Board</a> (MSPB) [official website] dismisses a mixed case on jurisdictional grounds is district court. The decision comes out of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/perry-v-merit-systems-protection-board/">Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], a case concerning a federal employee who had a complaint of both adverse employment accusations and that those accusations were based on discriminatory grounds, otherwise known as a "mixed case." If a federal employee asserts rights exclusively under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/senate-bill/2640">Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</a> (CSRA) [text], a statute that gives the MSPB the power to review personnel actions against a federal employee, the decisions are subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit whereas if the employee invokes federal antidiscrimination law, the federal district court has jurisdiction. The government argued that Perry should "split their claims, appealing MSPB nonappealability rulings to the Federal Circuit while repairing to the district court for adjudication of their discrimination claims." The court held, "in mixed cases, such as Perry's, in which the employee (or former employee) complains of serious adverse action prompted, in whole or in part, by the employing agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, the district court is the proper forum for judicial review. " Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented stating,<blockquote>At the end of a long day, I just cannot find anything preventing us from applying the statute as written&#8212;or heard any good reason for deviating from its terms. Indeed, it's not even clear how overhauling the statute as Mr. Perry wishes would advance the efficiency rationale he touts. The only thing that seems sure to follow from accepting his invitation is all the time and money litigants will spend, and all the ink courts will spill, as they work their way to a wholly remodeled statutory regime. Respectfully, Congress already wrote a perfectly good law. I would follow it.</blockquote>The Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in January and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jurisdiction-joinder-standing.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-214_f1gj.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 Friday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/murr-v-wisconsin/">Murr v. Wisconsin</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the lower court was correct in determining that a Wisconsin family's property was a single unit and the government's action did not constitute a "taking." The Murrs, owners of two adjacent properties together totaling just under one acre, sought a variance permitting them to sell one lot and remain domiciled in the other. A city ordinance requires that two adjacent parcels be considered one when totaling under one acre, an ordinance the Murrs challenged as a regulatory taking. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court held that the state court's analysis of the property as a single unit was correct:<blockquote>Like the ultimate question whether a regulation has gone too far, the question of the proper parcel in regulatory takings cases cannot be solved by any simple test. ... Courts must instead define the parcel in a manner that reflects reasonable expectations about the property. Courts must strive for consistency with the central purpose of the Takings Clause: to "bar Govern­ment from forcing some people alone to bear public bur­dens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole." ... Treating the lot in question as a single parcel is legitimate for purposes of this takings inquiry, and this supports the conclusion that no regulatory taking occurred here.</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the case.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-regulatory-takings-and-divorce-arrangements.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in March after <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in January 2016. JURIST Guest Columnist Brian T. Hodges of The Pacific Legal Foundation argued in February that the case could have a <a href="/hotline/2017/02/Brian-Hodges-murr-v-wisconsin.php">significant impact</a> [JURIST op-ed] on effect on regulatory takings jurisprudence nationwide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/16/16-60477-CV1.pdf">lifted an injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday on a Mississippi law that critics say allows individuals, including government employees, to discriminate against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people for religious reasons. According to a <a href="http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/gender-sexuality/files/memo_regarding_ms_hb1523.pdf">legal analysis</a> [text, PDF] from <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> [official website], <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/bill/HB1523/2016">House Bill 1523</a> [text], or the Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act, "strips Mississippians of applicable anti-discrimination protections in order to accommodate the preferences of religious individuals and institutions." Those with "a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction" can discriminate against LGBTQ individuals by denying housing, occupation, educational guidance, and other services. Heterosexual individuals could also be adversely affected such as single mothers being denied housing or  jobs due to a religious objection of premarital sex. The three-judge panel stated: <blockquote>Because a preliminary injunction may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief, the plaintiffs must make a clear showing that they have standing to maintain the preliminary injunction. None of these plaintiffs has clearly shown an injury-in-fact, so none has standing.</blockquote> Additionally, "It is not enough simply to argue that there has been some violation of the Establishment Clause; the plaintiffs must allege a personal violation of rights." The plaintiffs can request a rehearing before the full Fifth Circuit panel or appeal directly to the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>LGBT protections are still disputed globally and many rights groups have raised concerns about the future of LGBT rights within the US since the November elections. In May the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-lawsuit-against-california-ban-on-gay-conversion-therapy.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] an appeal challenging California's 2012 ban on "gay conversion" therapy. In April Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 53 men for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against "unlawful assembly" and the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act. The same week <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and other advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary General António Guterres</a> [official website] to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. A week earlier the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal judge issues temporary injunction blocking deportation of Iraq nationals</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/Hamama%20v%20Adducci.pdf">temporarily blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] the deportation of over 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) agents, for approximately two weeks during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter.Judge Mark Goldsmith, who issued the order staying the deportation, stated that it is not immediately clear whether the Iraq nationals will succeed in this action. Nevertheless, Goldsmith concluded that a proper consideration of various factors "counsels issuing a stay:"</p>

<blockquote>Irreparable harm is made out by the significant chance of loss of life and lesser forms of persecution that Petitioners have substantiated. Such harm far outweighs any conceivable interest the Government might have in the immediate enforcement of the removal orders, before this Court can clarify whether it has jurisdiction to grant relief to Petitioners on the merits of their claims. The public interest is also better served by an orderly court process that assures that Petitioners&#8217; invocation of federal court relief is considered before the removal process continues. Finally, it is true that the likelihood of success on the merits - whether defined as winning the jurisdiction issue or the right to modification of the removal orders - cannot yet be determined. But no one factor is dispositive; rather, all factors are to be balanced.</blockquote>

<p>Many of the Iraq nationals facing deportation are facing orders of removal, some of which are decades old, after being convicted of various crimes. This action was filed on behalf of these nationals by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], and arose as a habeas corpus class action petition. ACLU stated of the order: "We are thankful and relieved that our clients will not be immediately sent to Iraq, where they face grave danger of persecution, torture or death ... The court took a life-saving action by blocking our clients from being immediately sent back to Iraq."</p>

<p>Many of the individuals facing deportation include both Muslims and Christians from Iraq, who have been in the US for decades and had been allowed to stay because the Iraq government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-iraqis-idUSKBN19D2X3">would not issue</a> [Reuters report] them travel documents. That changed in March when Iraq began to allow deportees in <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/22/534038340/federal-judge-in-michigan-halts-deportation-of-iraqis-who-fear-torture">exchange</a> [NPR report] for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a>'s [official profile] removal of Iraq from the list of banned countries. The controversy surrounding immigration enforcement and Trump's immigration orders continues to rise. Last week the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-to-keep-daca-in-place.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will keep the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [materials] program in place for the foreseeable future. DACA allows for immigrants who came to the US as children, known as "Dreamers," to obtain work permits and remain in the country legally. This move is contradictory to President Donald Trump 2016 campaign promise to repeal DACA and DAPA. Earlier the same week the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against the majority of President Donald Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. The ruling affirmed the majority of a <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">district court injunction</a> [JURIST report] in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In April, Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/massachusetts-challenges-states-role-in-immigration-detention.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] its <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] to find that state authorities lack jurisdiction to <a href="">detain</a> [JURIST report] illegal immigrants. Many <a href="/forum/2016/12/Hugh-Spitzer-sanctuary-cities.php">cities</a> [JURIST op-ed] and <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/california-lawmakers-pass-two-bills-to-protect-undocumented-immigrant-students.php">states</a> [JURIST report] have also been enacting sanctuary laws to protect undocumented immigrants, particularly children and students.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Amnesty calls for review of hate crime legal framework and police training in UK</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/06/amnesty-international/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International UK</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/hate-crime-uk-police-need-more-training-says-amnesty">called for</a> [press release] improved police training and a review of the legal framework as they relate to hate crimes in the UK. In a news briefing tilted <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/Against-Hate-Briefing-AIUK.pdf">"Against Hate: Tackling hate crime in the UK"</a> [PDF], AI highlights a 42 per cent rise in hate crime in the two weeks prior to and following the EU referendum vote in 2016, primarily against members of minorities including, but not limited, to new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. AI noted its particular concern that "significant numbers of victims do not report their experiences to the police or other relevant organisations," adding: " police have not always regarded such offences with the seriousness they should - if, indeed, they have recognised them as offences at all." AI reasoned that the under-reporting of hate crimes is a reflection of the poor understanding of hate crime&#8212;"how it is defined, what forms it takes and how it applies in law - among actual and potential hate crime victims." Among the recommendations AI makes in its briefing to improve the situation include: 1) extended review of the hate crime legal framework in the UK 2) adopting policies to speak out against discriminatory language 3) sensitivity training for public officials, police officers, and others in the law enforcement and justice sectors, 4) fostering community engagement by public officials and law enforcement, 5) monitoring online hate crime, and 6) extending the category of protected groups to include gender, age, socio-economic status and any and all characteristics that should have equal legal protection. The AI briefing documents the accounts of various individuals who have been subjected to hate crimes in the UK. Referring to the events following the recent London and Manchester attacks, AI UK Director Kate Allen stated: </p>

<blockquote>we have seen reports of a rise in demonising language and dangerous comments that can cause real harm to real people. Now, more than ever, we must stand together against this hatred .... We are now calling for police to receive increased training in how to respond to hate crime and support victims, for more resources to assist investigation and prosecution, and for more awareness in how victims can report hate crimes.</blockquote>

<p>Almost a year ago the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office">UK Home Office</a> [official website] encouraged prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-urges-prosecutors-to-combat-hate-crimes-with-tougher-sentences.php">use tougher sentences</a> [JURIST report] against hate crimes in response to the nation's increasingly hostile environment since the EU referendum. That move came as a response to the more than 6,000 hate crimes and incidents reported to the authorities since June 2016. Hate crimes have been on the rise in recent years both within and outside the US. In November, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov">FBI</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/fbi-reports-rise-in-hate-crimes-especially-against-muslims.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the 2015 Hate Crime Statistics showing the number of hate crimes reported to police to have increased by about 6.7 percent the previous year, led largely by a 67 percent rise in crimes against Muslims. Two months prior, a report compiled by <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">California State University, San Bernardino</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/research-finds-highest-increase-in-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-since-911.php">similarly revealed</a> [JURIST report] an increase in hate crimes in 2015, particularly among Muslims and Arab-Americans. The study compiled data from 20 states, representing over 53 percent of the national population. Overall hate crimes across the 20 states increased by about 5 percent. However, hate crimes against Muslims increased by 78 percent. Despite the increase of hate crimes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/hate-crimes-legislation.html">five states still do not have any hate-crime statutes</a> [NYT report]: Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, Wyoming and Indiana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The lower house of the <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/">German Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/120/1812038.pdf">passed a bill</a> [PDF, in German] to compensate thousands of individuals who had been persecuted and imprisoned for their sexuality. The law under which the individuals had been convicted is <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/learn/students/learning-materials-and-resources/homosexuals-victims-of-the-nazi-era/paragraph-175">paragraph 175</a> [text] of Germany's criminal code, and was put in place in 1871. The scope of the law was broadened under the Nazi regime, and was used to convict men as recently as 1967. Individuals who were wrongfully convicted are <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-compensate-victims-of-anti-gay-laws/a-38062309">expected to receive</a> [DW report] €3,000 for each conviction and €1,500 for each year in jail as compensation. The bill will still need to be voted on by the parliament's upper house, although it has already announced that the bill will be approved. Stating that "The norm created unimaginable suffering, which led to self-denial, sham marriages, harassment and blackmail" <a href="http://www.bmjv.de/DE/Ministerium/Minister/Minister_node.html">Germany Justice Minister Heiko Maas</a> [official profile, in German] called the Bundestag decision a "belated act of justice."

LGBTQ+ rights and anti-homosexuality laws have been a matter of international controversy for decades, and have been receiving increasing attention and scrutiny in the past few years. In April, Nigeria prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the <a href="/paperchase/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20Prohibition%20Act.pdf">Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act</a> [text, PDF]. A day earlier <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and other <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">advocacy groups had urged</a> [JURIST report] UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary General António Guterres</a> [official website] to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter, about 100 gay and bisexual men were detained, tortured, murdered or went missing under the authority of Chechen officials. The previous week the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/justice-department-drops-lawsuit-against-north-carolina-over-bathroom-bill.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit against the state of North Carolina over a bill requiring transgender people to use the public bathroom associated with their birth gender. Earlier the same month the Nebraska Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/-nebraska-top-court-strikes-down-ban-on-same-sex-foster-parenting.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision overruling the state of Nebraska's long-time ban on same sex partner foster parenting. In February the UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a> <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/uk-posthumously-pardons-thousands-of-gay-men-convicted-of-sex-offenses.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the enactment of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/3/pdfs/ukpga_20170003_en.pdf">Policing and Crime Act</a> [text, PDF], a law very similar to the Germany bill, posthumously pardoning thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted of sexual offenses]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] on Wednesday denied in part and granted in part a <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/69_-_order_on_class_cert_and_mtd.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> [order, PDF] a class-action suit filed against <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. The suit was filed against the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/refugeescreening#CARRP">Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program</a> (CARRP) [USCIS summary] and claims that the USCIS secretly and unlawfully targets immigration applicants who are Muslim or from certain Muslim-majority countries. Judge Richard Jones certified anyone who had applied for naturalization and been subject to CARRP or a successor "extreme vetting" program as a class. The order also certified an "adjustment class" for applicants seeking an adjustment to their citizenship status. However, the order dismissed with prejudice a due process claim for the adjustment class.</p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the Federal Judiciary. On Thursday the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of over 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by US <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Last week the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May, a federal district court in Washington granted a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order. In March <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/">California Attorney General Xavier Becerra</a> [official website] announced that his state would be joining Washington and Minnesota in their <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/california-joins-multi-state-lawsuit-against-revised-immigration-order.php">lawsuit against Trump's revised executive order</a> [JURIST report] banning citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday rejected calls to cease Turkish military presence and close its military base in Qatar. He <a href="<a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/erdogan-backs-qatar-against-demands-by-gulf-states/848602">viewed</a> [Anadolu News, report] these demand as disrespectful to Turkey. Additionally, President Erdogan claimed that the list of 13 <a href="https://apnews.com/3a58461737c44ad58047562e48f46e06/List-of-demands-on-Qatar-by-Saudi-Arabia,-other-Arab-nations"> demands </a> [AP, materials] imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were an unlawful interference with Qatar's sovereignty. The demands against Qatar were prompted by allegations that Qatar condones and funds terrorist activity. Erdogan said that he supports Qatar's contention that the list of demands is unreasonable. Qatar was given a ten day window to comply with the demands. </p>

<p>While these four Arab countries have called on Qatar to clean up its act, they have also received criticism recently. Earlier in June, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/amnesty-accuses-bahrain-of-taking-step-towards-total-suppression-of-human-rights.php"> accused </a> [JURIST report] Bahrain of moving toward a total suppression of human rights after a major political party in opposition to the government was dissolved. In May, Saudi Arabia was <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-saudis-demolition-of-historic-neighborhood-violates-human-rights.php"><br />
 accused </a> [JURIST report] of violating human rights for demolishing a culturally significant neighborhood. Earlier in May, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Ben Emmerson, <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/un-expert-saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-policies-threaten-rights.php"> said </a> [JURIST report] that Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism laws are too broad and post a threat to individual rights. In March, Bahrain's upper house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/bahrain-parliament-approves-military-trials-for-civilians.php"> approved </a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment that would allow military trials for civilians accused of being involved in terrorism plots. In July 2016, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-egypt-security-forces-have-abducted-and-tortured-hundreds.php"> reported </a> [JURIST report] that hundreds of Egyptians had been abducted and tortured by Egypt's National Security Agency during a crackdown on political activists and protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Cambodia's former head of state on Friday rejected charges of crimes against humanity in his UN-assisted tribunal. The 85-year-old Khieu Samphan, who was head of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/newswires/news/world/khmer-rouge-leaders-deliver-closing-defense-trial-article-1.3271420">said</a> [AP report] the allegations were concocted by neighboring country Vietnam. Samphan denied knowing about the forced marriages, executions, and starvations that occurred during the regime and asserted that he only found about the suffering after the rule ended. Commenting on the trial, Samphan stated "I want to bow to the memory of all the innocent victims but also to all those who perished by believing in a better ideal of the brighter future and who died during the five-year war... Their memory will never be honored by any international tribunal." Samphan's co-defendant, Nuon Chea, did not appear in court but his lawyers stated that the tribunal was a "show trial" and "victor's justice." The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28654147">two men</a> [BBC backgrounder] are already serving life sentences for crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>Cambodia continues to struggle with the legacy of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-10684399">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder], an extremist group that attempted to set up an agrarian socialist society in the nation in the mid- to late-1970s. In December Cambodia's Khmer Rouge Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/cambodia-tribunal-charges-ex-navy-commander-with-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Meas Muth, the Khmer Rouge's ex-navy commander, with genocide, crimes against humanity and other crimes. In March of last year, the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-khmer-rouge-member-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former Khmer Rouge member Cadre Ao An with crimes against humanity for his role in the maintenance of an execution site and two security centers during the Democratic Kampuchea. Earlier that March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-cambodia-must-act-on-criminal-charges-against-khmer-rouge.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Cambodian government to act on criminal charges brought against former Khmer Rouge leaders. The Khmer Rouge have been blamed for roughly 1.7 million deaths between 1975 and 1979 while leader Pol Pot was in power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-1436_l6hc.pdf">agreed to review</a> [opinion, PDF] the Trump administration's travel ban, partially lifting the temporary injunction that had blocked the ban's enforcement. The administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/trump-administration-appeals-travel-ban-to-supreme-court.php">sought review</a> [JURIST report] of decisions issued by the US Courts of Appeal for the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth</a> and <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuits</a> [official websites] last month. The Supreme Court's order permits execution of the travel ban, but it "may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States." The opinion, which was delivered per curiam, states that the lower courts' injunctions:<blockquote>bar enforcement of [the travel ban] against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States at all. The equities relied on by the lower courts do not balance the same way in that context. Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national. And the courts below did not conclude that exclusion in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself. So whatever burdens may result from enforcement of [the ban] against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, dissented in part by asserting that "the preliminary injunctions entered in these cases should be stayed, although I would stay them in full." </p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the Federal Judiciary. Last week the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. On Thursday the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington granted a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062617zor_8759.pdf">agreed to hear</a> [order list, PDF] arguments in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/masterpiece-cakeshop-ltd-v-colorado-civil-rights-commn/">Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission</a>, a case concerning a bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/digital-realty-trust-inc-v-somers/">Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. The court also denied review of an important <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [LII materials] gun rights case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/peruta-v-california/">Peruta v. California</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. Additionally, the court issued a summary reversal [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/pavan-v-smith/">Pavan v. Smith</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], a case concerning same-sex parents' names being listed on birth certificates.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission</span> the court will determine if the state's public accommodations law violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [LII materials] rights of a "cake artist" by requiring him to compromise his religious beliefs by making cakes for same-sex marriages. The case concerns Charlie Craig and David Mullins who intended to commission Masterpiece Cakeshop for the celebration of their wedding but were denied service because of the owner's religious beliefs. Petitioner filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16-111-cert-petition.pdf"><em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [petition, PDF] last July.</p>

<p>In <span class="casename">Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers</span> the court will determine if "whistleblowers" who did not report misconduct to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] are protected by the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4173/text">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010</a> (DFA) [text]. The case concerns an employee of Digital Trust Realty, Paul Somers, who sued his employer when he was terminated for reporting possible securities law violations to senior management. Somers was fired before he could take the allegations to the SEC. Digital Reality asserts that because he only reported the misconduct internally, he is not covered by the DFA's "whistleblower" protection provisions. </p>

<p>The court denied review of the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>'s [official website] decision for <span class="casename">Peruta v. California</span>. The case concerns a group of gun right's advocates from San Diego and Yolo Counties, joined by the <a href="http://crpa.org/">California Rifle and Pistol Association Foundation</a> [official website], who allege that their counties' "good cause requirements" for concealed-carry permits violated their Second Amendment rights. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16-894-opinion-below-9th-cir.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] "that there is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public."</p>

<p>Finally, in <span class="casename">Pavan v. Smith</span> the court held that "the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples." The case concerns two lesbian couples who each had a child born in Arkansas. Under Arkansas law, when an opposite-sex couple has a child, the woman's spouse is listed on the birth certificate, regardless of whether he is the biological father. The law did not extend to same-sex couples. Both couples were denied the right to have the names of both parents on the birth certificates of their children. The court looked to the decision in <span class="casename">Obergefell v. Hodges</span> to commit to "provid[ing] same-sex couples the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-577_khlp.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trinity-lutheran-church-of-columbia-inc-v-pauley/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the Missouri Department of Natural Resources policy of excluding religious organizations from receiving grants violates the First Amendment. The Department offers grants to public and private schools and daycares to resurface playgrounds with material made from recycled tires. Trinity Lutheran Church applied for a grant for its preschool and daycare center but was denied because it was a religious entity. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the policy violates the Establishment Clause:<blockquote>The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has not subjected anyone to chains or torture on account of religion. And the result of the State's policy is nothing so dramatic as the denial of political office. The consequence is, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees. But the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.</blockquote>Roberts appeared to attempt to limit the holding to the facts of this case in footnote 3, but Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch did not join as to that note. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Gorsuch, and Gorsuch filed a concurring opinion, joined by Thomas. Justice Stephen Breyer also filed a concurring opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ineffective-counsel-and-government-aid-to-church-programs.php">heard arguments</a> in this case in April after <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] last year. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/trinity-op-below.pdf">ruled in favor</a> [opinion, PDF] of the Department's policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-6219_i425.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/davila-v-davis/?wpmp_switcher=desktop"><span class="casename">Davila v. Davis</span></a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the procedural default of ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims are not excused by the ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. Petitioner Erik Davila confessed to accidentally killing a woman and her five-year-old granddaughter, as well as wounding several others, while he was attempting to shoot the woman's son during a birthday party in 2008. The state of Texas indicted Davila for capital murder because he had killed more than one person during the same transaction. The jury was instructed on transferred intent and informed that it could find Davila "guilty of murder if it determined that he intended to kill one person but instead killed a different person." Davila was convicted. During appeal his appellate counsel argued that the state failed show the requisite intent of a guilty verdict but neglected to challenge the instruction of transferred intent. The <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/cca">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] affirmed Davila's conviction and sentence. When Davila appealed to state court he again did not challenge the instruction nor did he challenge his counsel's failure to raise the issue on direct appeal. Petitioner requested that the court expand <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/martinez-v-ryan/">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], a case that <a href="https://origin-www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Martinez_v_Ryan_No_101001_2012_BL_66019_US_Mar_20_2012_Court_Opin?1498515731">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ineffective assistance of a prisoner's lawyer in state post-conviction proceedings would excuse the prisoner's failure to press the underlying ineffective assistance claim at trail, to include ineffective assistance that failed to raise the issue on appeal as well. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court, stating:<blockquote>We think it is likely that the claims heard in federal court because of petitioner's proposed rule would also be largely meritless, given that the proposed rule would generally affect only those cases in which the trial court already adjudicated, and rejected, the prisoner's argument regarding the alleged underlying trial error. Given that petitioner's proposed rule would likely generate high systemic costs and low systemic benefits, and that the unique concerns of <span class="casename">Martinez</span> are not implicated in cases like his, we do not think equity requires an expansion of <span class="casename">Martinez.</span></blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented stating, "The basic legal principle that should determine the outcome of this case is the principle that requires courts to treat like cases alike."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php">granted <em>certorari</em></a> for <span class="casename">Davila v. Davis</span> in January and <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-two-capital-punishment-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Norwegian Nobel Committee <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2010/statement.html">stated</a> [Nobel Prize press release] that it was "delighted to learn that Liu Xiaobo is out of prison at long last.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] closed its 2016 term Monday with <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062617zor_8759.pdf">orders</a> [order list, PDF] in several pending cases. The court ordered reargument in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jennings-v-rodriguez/">Jennings v. Rodrigues</a> [SCOTUSblog Materials], in which the court must determine three issues concerning whether aliens seeking entry into the United States must be afforded bond hearings, especially in situations involving criminal or terrorist aliens who are subject to mandatory detention. The court also ordered reargument in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lynch-v-dimaya/">Sessions v. Dimaya</a> [SCOTUSblog Materials], where the Court will consider whether a section of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/16">United States Code</a> [text] defining crimes of violence, and as incorporated into the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [text] provisions governing an alien's removal from the US, is unconstitutionally vague. The court also issued an unsigned <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-118_97bf.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hernandez-v-mesa/">Hernández v. Mesa</a> [SCOTUSblog Materials], the cross-border shooting case, remanding the case to the lower court to look at whether there is a <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents</a> [text] issue, and what that issue would be in light of another case the court handed down last week. <span class="casename">Bivens</span> stands for the proposition that a plaintiff can bring a private federal case for damages against federal officials who allegedly violated plaintiff's constitutional rights, and the court has remanded for the lower court to examine whether there is a remedy for Hernández when there are "special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-373_pm02.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/california-public-employees-retirement-system-v-moody-investors-service-inc/">California Public Employees' Retirement System v. Anz Securities, Inc., et al.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a member of a class action suit cannot file a new suit separately past the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/statute_of_repose">statute of repose</a> [LII backgrounder]. Justice Anthony Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court in the 5-4 decision. Kennedy did not buy petitioner's argument that the court's decision in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/414/538">American Pipe and Construction Co. et al. v. State of Utah et al.</a> [LII backgrounder] stating that American Pipe was not a case that revolved around a "legislative enactment" instead of the "tradition equitable powers of the judiciary." In this case, Section 13 of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf">Securities Act of 1933</a> [text, PDF] sets the three-year bar that controls Section 11. "The statute displaces the traditional power of courts to modify statutory time limits in the name of equity. Because the American Pipe tolling rule is rooted in those equitable powers, it cannot extend the 3-year period. Petitioner's untimely filing of its individual action is ground for dismissal."</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jurisdiction-joinder-standing.php">heard arguments</a> for this case in April after <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-court-adds-16-cases-to-docket.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062717zr_6537.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in six cases Tuesday. In the consolidated cases of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/christie-v-national-collegiate-athletic-association-2/">Christie v. NCAA</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-jersey-thoroughbred-horsemens-association-inc-v-national-collegiate-athletic-association-2/">National Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association v. NCAA</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], the court will consider whether a New Jersey law allowing sports betting at casinos and race tracks is preempted by federal law. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-178">Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act</a> [text] prohibits most states from operating a gambling system based on professional or college sports. The question before the court is whether that statute violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text].</p>

<p>The court also agreed to hear a case concerning enforcement of a $7.5 million judgment against Iran for its role in a suicide bombing in Jerusalem. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rubin-v-islamic-republic-of-iran-2/">Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court must determine whether plaintiffs can seize Persian artifacts that are on loan to the University of Chicago. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> [text] generally prohibits seizure of property owned by foreign governments but creates some exceptions. The question before the court is whether <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1610">28 USC § 1610(g)</a> [text] provides a freestanding attachment immunity exception that allows terror victim judgment creditors to attach and execute upon assets of foreign state sponsors of terrorism regardless of whether assets are otherwise subject to execution under Section 1610.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/cyan-inc-v-beaver-county-employees-retirement-fund/">Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Retirement Fund</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court will determine whether state courts have jurisdiction over class action suits claiming violations of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf">Securities Act of 1933</a> [text, PDF] or whether the 1998 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/105/plaws/publ353/PLAW-105publ353.pdf">Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act</a> [text, PDF] prohibits such jurisdiction. A California appeals court found that state courts <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-1439-Op-Bel.pdf">retain jurisdiction</a> [opinion, PDF].</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/pem-entities-llc-v-levin/">PEM Entities LLC v. Levin</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court will determine whether bankruptcy courts should apply a federal rule of decision or a state law rule of decision when deciding to recharacterize a debt claim in bankruptcy as a capital contribution.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/marinello-v-united-states/">Marinello v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court will consider whether a conviction under 26 USC § 7212(a) for corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or impede the due administration of the tax laws requires proof that the defendant acted with knowledge of a pending Internal Revenue Service action.</p>

<p>Also Tuesday the court sent several cases involving the use of public funds in religious schools back to the lower courts for further consideration in light of Monday's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-allows-use-of-public-funds-for-religious-school-playground.php">Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/doyle-v-taxpayers-for-public-education/">Doyle v. Taxpayers for Public Education</a>, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/douglas-cnty-school-dist-v-taxpayers-for-public-education/">Douglas County School District v. Taxpayers for Public Education</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/colorado-state-bd-of-education-v-taxpayers-for-public-education/">Colorado State Board of Education v. Taxpayers for Public Education</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] involve a Colorado Supreme Court decision that a public program to provide scholarships to attend religious schools violated the state constitution. And <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/new-mexico-association-of-nonpublic-schools-v-moses/">New Mexico Association of Nonpublic Schools v. Moses</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] involves a textbook-lending program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US District Judge Mark Goldsmith issued a nationwide <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hamama-v-adducci-opinion-order">temporary stay</a> [order] on Monday to protect 1,444 Iraqi immigrants from deportation, extending an order issued last Thursday that applied only to immigrants in the Detroit metro area. Goldsmith's order on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by US <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Goldsmith's purpose for issuing the emergency order nationwide is to protect many Iraqi immigrants who would likely suffer persecution if sent back to Iraq, and to give them more time to seek legal action.<blockquote>And what was said in support of the issuance of that TRO supports the instant order. The same grave consequences face the expanded class, which establishes irreparable harm. Such harm far outweighs any interest the Government may have in proceeding with the removals immediately. And once again, the public interest is served by assuring that habeas rights are not lost before this Court can assess whether it has jurisdiction in this case.</blockquote>Goldsmith's order will expire in 14 days, unless another order is granted. </p>

<p>Many of the individuals facing deportation include both Muslims and Christians from Iraq, who have been in the US for decades and had been allowed to stay because the Iraq government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-iraqis-idUSKBN19D2X3">would not issue</a> [Reuters report] them travel documents. That changed in March when Iraq began to allow deportees in <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/22/534038340/federal-judge-in-michigan-halts-deportation-of-iraqis-who-fear-torture">exchange</a> [NPR report] for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] removing Iraq from the list of banned countries. Earlier this week the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">agreed to rule</a> [JURIST report] on Trump's travel ban and allowed its partial enforcement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/index_en">European Commission</a> [official website] fined Google and its parent company, Alphabet,  € 2.42 billion Tuesday for <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1784_en.htm">violating</a> [press release] EU antitrust restrictions. The decision focused on Google's comparative shopping service, which premiered as "Froogle" in 2004, and is known today as Google Shopping. The Commission determined that Google used its "dominance in general internet search" to unfairly promote its shopping service instead of promoting Google Shopping on its merits. Google gave its Google Shopping prominent placement in its own search results and subsequently demoted the placement of other similar services. The advantage Google gave its shopping service was deemed illegal by the Commission. </p>

<p>High-profile antitrust litigation has been ongoing in 2017. In May EU antitrust regulators fined Facebook $122 million for <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/eu-fines-facebook-for-misleading-regulators-on-whatsapp-deal.php">misleading information</a> [JURIST report] regarding a deal for WhatsApp. In February the National Collegiate Athletic Association and 11 conferences agreed to a $208.7 million <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/ncaa-and-conferences-agree-to-2087-million-settlement-in-antitrust-suit.php">settlement </a>[JURIST report] in a class action suit brought by former college athletes alleging their scholarships were illegally capped. In January a US federal court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-apple-antitrust-suit-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that plaintiffs may sue Apple for violating antitrust regulations by forcing users to purchase apps exclusively through their app store. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's Attorney General Rodrigo Janot filed <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/noticias-pgr/pgr-denuncia-michel-temer-e-rodrigo-loures-por-corrupcao-passiva-1">charges</a> [press release, in Portuguese] Monday against President Michel Temer for passive corruption. A former aide to the president was also charged. Temer is accused of taking a bribe from entrepreneur <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jbs-chairman-joesley-batista-resigns-1495837143">Joesley Batista</a> [WSJ report]. Temer issued a <a href="http://www2.planalto.gov.br/acompanhe-planalto/noticias/2017/06/em-defesa-da-presidencia-e-da-honra-diz-temer-nao-fugirei-das-batalhas">statement</a> [text, in Portuguese]Tuesday in his defense. He said he intends to stay in the presidency and fight the allegations against him. </p>

<p>Brazil has endured tumultuous times during which former presidents have been caught in scandals of receiving various bribes from various businesses. Former president Dilma Rousseff was <a href="/hotline/2016/09/joseph-marren-brazil-president.php">impeached for corruption</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year amidst a time of economic turmoil. In April Brazil's Supreme Court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/brazil-supreme-court-judge-orders-investigation-of-cabinet-ministers.php">investigations</a> [JURIST report] into eight cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers who are allegedly linked to the country's so-called "car wash" bribery scheme. In May the Brazil Supreme Court authorized a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/brazil-top-court-authorizes-corruption-probe-into-president-temer.php">corruption probe</a> [JURIST report] into Temer and his alleged involvement with the bribery of a potential witness in a major corruption case. Former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/brazil-prosecutors-file-new-charges-against-former-president-da-silva.php">implicated in the scandal</a> [JURIST report] warranting charges to filed against him, including most powerful politicians. In November lawyers for ousted former president Rousseff <a href="/paperchase/2016/11/ousted-brazil-president-accuses-current-leader-of-taking-large-bribe.php">filed documents</a> [JURIST report] alleging Temer took a large bribe. In June Brazil's top electoral court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/brazil-top-electoral-court-dismisses-case-that-could-have-ousted-president.php">dismissed a case</a> [JURIST report] against Temer for alleged illegal campaign funding in his 2014 election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official websites] on Tuesday released a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-06/documents/wotus_prepublication_version.pdf">proposal</a> [text] that will rescind the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/06/29/2015-13435/clean-water-rule-definition-of-waters-of-the-united-states">2015 Clean Water Rule</a> [text] implemented by the Obama administration. The so-called Water of the United States Rule (WOTUS) was proposed in 2014 as a means to clarify the legal jurisdiction of the federal government under the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/fwatrpo.HTML">Clean Water Act</a> [text]. The rule <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-regulation-idUSKBN19I2L0">expanded</a> [Reuters report] the definition of waterways to include streams, rivers, wetlands and other bodies. Those who opposed WOTUS, such as members of the agriculture and energy industries, felt that the expansion granted the federal government too much power. In a <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-us-army-move-rescind-2015-waters-us">press release</a> [text] from the EPA, administrator Scott Pruitt said:<blockquote>We are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nation's farmers and businesses.This is the first step in the two-step process to redefine 'waters of the U.S.' and we are committed to moving through this re-evaluation to quickly provide regulatory certainty, in a way that is thoughtful, transparent and collaborative with other agencies and the public.</blockquote>Advocacy groups, such as <a href="http://www.environmentamerica.org/">Environment America</a> and <a href="http://elpc.org/">Environmental Law and Policy Center</a> [advocacy websites], have expressed concern that the proposal will lead to increased pollution and the contamination of the nation's waterways.</p>

<p>A priority of the Trump administration has been to roll back regulations and alter the country's energy and environmental policies, which the current administration claims have hurt jobs and the growth of the economy. In March the Trump administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-administration-requests-delay-of-appeals-court-ruling-on-clean-power-plan.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to postpone ruling on the Obama administration's climate change regulations. This request came after President Donald Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/trump-signs-executive-order-rolling-back-obama-energy-regulations.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order rolling back the Obama administration policies. The C<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-10-23/pdf/2015-22842.pdf">lean Power Plan</a> [text, PDF] was challenged during Obama's presidency by certain states and industry groups that rely on the coal industry. In February Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-legislation-rolling-back-obama-era-coal-mining-regulation.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that rolled back coal mining regulations implemented by the Obama administration. Also that week the president <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/trump-signs-bill-repealing-regulation-on-energy-company-payments-to-foreign-governments.php">signed a repeal of regulations</a> [JURIST report] that required energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments. Shortly after his inauguration, Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/trump-signs-orders-to-advance-construction-of-oil-pipeline.php">signed orders advancing the construction</a> [JURIST report] of both the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/opinions/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2017/06/27/15-15434.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a San Francisco ordinance on Tuesday that was implemented to halt deceptive advertising tactics employed by clinics opposed to abortion. The ordinance <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Appeals-court-upholds-SF-law-on-deceptive-11251223.php">targeted</a> [SF Gate report] clinics that offered offered services, including tests and ultrasounds, as a way of dissuading women from terminating their pregnancies. The clinics did not offer abortions, emergency contraception or referrals to other clinics that provide those options. First Resort, a group aimed at creating "an abortion free world," sued the city asserting that the ordinance violates their <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [LII materials] right to free speech. The ordinance, which was backed by a similar state law introduced by San Francisco Supervisor <a href="https://a17.asmdc.org/">David Chiu</a> in 2016, was put into affect by Supervisor <a href="http://sfbos.org/supervisor-cohen-district-10">Malia Cohen</a> [official websites] in 2011. </p>

<p>Unencumbered access to abortion has been a recent issue since President Donald Trump vowed to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will overturn <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">landmark ruling</a> [JURIST report], holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. Also in June the Delaware legislature approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. The same day, Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed a series of abortion regulations into law </a>[JURIST report]. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. In February the US House of Representatives approved a <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and passed a <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. In February the Pennsylvania Senate approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16701/index.do">upheld an order</a> [judgment, PDF] on Wednesday that directed <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> [corporate website] to block a company's website from is global search results. The ruling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-google-idUSKBN19J27N">stems from a suit</a> [Reuters report] brought by a small technology company, <a href="http://www.equustek.com/">Equustek Solutions Inc</a>, who asserted that <a href="http://datalinkgateways.ca/">Datalink Technologies Gateways</a> [corporate websites] had committed copyright infringement by relabeling and selling one of Equustek's products as their own. Equustek requested that Google remove search results for Datalink until the pending case was resolved. Google removed the search results, including some 300 pages associated with Datalink, but only from the Canadian version of their search engine. The <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">Court of Appeal for British Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2015/2015bcca265/2015bcca265.html">ordered</a> [judgment] Google to desist from displaying search results that link back to Datalink in any country. Several advocacy groups, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], intervened in the case in the interest of preventing a justification for censorship and limiting the freedom of expression. The court responded to this argument by stating:<blockquote>This is not an order to remove speech that, on its face, engages freedom of expression values, it is an order to de-index websites that are in violation of several court orders. We have not, to date, accepted that freedom of expression requires the facilitation of the unlawful sale of goods.</blockquote>Although Google cannot appeal the ruling, the Supreme Court did not prohibit the company from applying to the British Columbia courts to "vary the interlocutory order accordingly."</p>

<p>The ruling from the Canadian Supreme Court is the first of its kind. Various countries have struggled in recent years with balancing the freedom of expression on the Internet and copyright infringement. The <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] last April <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/australia-court-orders-isps-to-disclose-information-about-illegal-downloaders.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] six Internet service providers (ISPs) to hand over information about alleged illegal downloaders of the US film Dallas Buyer's Club. In April 2014 the Senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/brazil-ratifies-bill-on-internet-privacy.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that eliminates ISPs' liability for content published by their users and requires providers to remove offensive materials following court orders. That March Viacom and Google <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/google-and-viacom-settle-copyright-infringement-suit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a copyright infringement lawsuit that Viacom had filed against Google's YouTube website for allowing clips of Viacom's television programs to be posted without authorization. In June 2013 Russia passed an <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/russia-parliament-approves-internet-piracy-bill.php">anti-piracy bill</a> [JURIST report] that allows websites to be blocked by ISPs upon copyright infringement claims. In 2012 the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] that created a government agency with the authority to force ISPs to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyright materials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Gerechtshof-Den-Haag/">Hague Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Dutch] on Tuesday <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:GHDHA:2017:1761">upheld</a> [judgment, in Dutch] a lower court's decision that Dutch peacekeepers were 30 percent responsible for the deaths of 300 Muslim males who were turned away from a Dutch UN base in 1995 when the area surrounding the base was overrun with Bosnian Serb troops. In the ruling, Presiding Judge Gepke Dulek-Schermers said dutch soldiers "knew or should have known that the men were not only being screened ... but were in real danger of being subjected to torture or execution." The court found the Netherlands only 30 percent liable because it was estimated that there was a 70 percent chance the men would have been killed regardless of the actions of the Dutch soldiers. The court also rejected an appeal that accused the Netherlands of being responsible for thousands of other Muslims who had gathered outside the base. The total amount of damages will be determined in a later ruling. The Dutch defense ministry is reviewing the ruling. A spokesman for the ministry denied any responsibility.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. In December six former officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina were <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/bosnia-prosecutor-indicts-six-former-officials-in-war-crimes.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/index.php?jezik=b">Special Department for War Crimes</a> [official website]. In October a Croatian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2016/10/croatia-prosecutor-charges-ex-yugoslav-military-officers-with-war-crimes.php">charged eight ex-Yugoslav military officers</a> [JURIST report], including commander Borislav Djukic, with war crimes perpetrated during the Croatian War of Independence. In July Brazilian authorities arrested a man charged with <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/brazil-authorities-arrest-man-for-war-crimes-in-former-yugoslavia.php">committing war crimes in 1992</a> [JURIST report] against the civilian population of former Yugoslavia. The search for wanted criminal Nikola Ceranic began in late June after Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities forwarded an extradition request to the Brazilian Justice Ministry and Supreme Court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/271339.pdf">2017 Trafficking in Persons Report</a> [report, PDF] released on Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] downgraded China to Tier 3, which is the lowest tier for human trafficking. Tier 3 represents "countries whose governments do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. China joins 22 other countries in the tier, including Russia, North Korea and Syria. China was last in Tier 3 in 2013, being located in Tier 2 Watch List in 2014-2016. A country is automatically downgraded to Tier 3 if they are located in Tier 2 Watch List for more than two years unless they are granted a waiver. In order to be in Tier 2, a country must be making significant efforts to come in compliance with Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum standards. The report acknowledged that China has made some steps to address trafficking. However, the government has been found to be complicit in forced labor at drug rehabilitation centers and in Xinjiang. The country also forcibly returned North Koreans to North Korea without screening them for signs of trafficking. It is also unclear if the country has screened for signs of trafficking any of those who were arrested for prostitution. The total number of people who were convicted for sex and labor trafficking has decreased compared to the previous year. </p>

<p>China has seen continued criticism regarding their treatment of human rights in recent years. In February the <a href="https://www.nchrd.org/">Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [Official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/report-china-targeting-human-rights-defenders-as-national-security-threat.php">released</a> [JURIST report] an report accusing China of criminalizing human rights activities. In December the UN called on China to <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/un-calls-on-china-to-investigate-disappearance-of-human-rights-lawyer.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] the disappearance of human rights lawyer Jiang Tianyong, after he had been missing for two months. The same month China <a href="/paperchase/2016/12/china-suspends-law-license-of-prominent-human-rights-lawyer.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the law license of prominent human rights lawyer Li Jinxing, over his apparent allegedly unacceptable behavior in court while defending a client. In September China <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">handed down a 12 year sentence</a> [JURIST report] to prominent human rights lawyer Xia Lin. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] on Wednesday issued guidelines for the modified travel ban <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-review-administrations-travel-ban.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] earlier this week. The order permits denying visas to travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries unless the visitor has a "bona fide relationship" with a business or close family member but the court did not define what constitutes as such. According to the State Department, business and professional relationships must be formal and documented. Those who have legitimate offers for employment and education are exempt providing the invitations are not for the purposes of evading the ban. The Trump administration has <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/06/28/534760203/trump-travel-ban-could-be-implemented-thursday">interpreted</a> [NPR report] "close family ties" as parents, including a parent-in-laws; adolescent and adult children; son-in-laws and daughter-in-laws; spouses; and siblings, including half and step siblings. Not included are grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, brother-in-laws, sister-in-laws, fiancees and other extended family. Those who have already been granted visas will be permitted to enter the US. The new rules will go into effect June 29 at 8:00 PM and will remain in place until the Supreme Court hears arguments for the cases against Trump's travel ban.</p>

<p>Cases concerning issues of immigration from predominantly Muslim countries continue to be processed in the Federal Judiciary. Last week the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-district-judge-rejects-bid-to-dismiss-class-action-on-extreme-vetting-measures---dnp.php">denied in part</a> [JURIST report] and granted in part a motion to dismiss a class action suit filed against <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-trump">President Donald Trump</a> [official profile] and the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">US Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> (USCIS) [official website]. On Thursday the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-michigan-judge-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-over-100-iraqis.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the deportation of more than 100 Iraq nationals, arrested by <a href="https://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcemen</a>t (ICE) [official website] agents, for approximately two weeks, during which time the court will decide whether it has jurisdiction in the matter. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-revised-travel-ban-1.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000871">case materials</a>] the majority of Trump's revised executive order limiting travel from six Muslim-majority countries. That ruling <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/federal-judge-extends-block-on-trump-travel-ban.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the majority of a district court injunction in March that blocked the order from being enforced. In May a federal district court in Washington granted a <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-judge-blocks-order-limiting-legal-aid-to-immigrants.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to allow legal aid groups to continue to provide certain kinds of assistance to undocumented immigrants. Five days prior a Michigan federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/federal-court-orders-immigration-ban-draft-memo-released-in-discovery.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Trump administration to disclose the draft of the so-called "Muslim ban" executive order</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ohiosenate.gov/index">Ohio Senate</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-votes?id=GA132-SB-145">voted 24-9</a> [voter breakdown] Wednesday to approve <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-documents?id=GA132-SB-145">SB 145</a> [materials], a bill the criminalizes a common second-trimester abortion procedure. The bill <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2017/06/ohio_senate_bans_2nd_trimester.html">specifically targets</a> [Cleveland.com report] dilation and evacuation (D&E) which is usually performed after the twelfth week of pregnancy. During a D&E a woman's cervix is dilated and the fetus is removed with suction and surgical instruments. Should the bill be enacted, it will <a href="http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2017/06/29/Ohio-Senate-votes-to-ban-method-of-abortion-Ohio-House-must-OK-rule-affecting-the-2nd-trimester.html">leave Ohio women</a> [ToledoBlade report] with few options for terminating their pregnancy after the first trimester. One option, medically induced labor, has much higher risks associated with it and was performed fewer than 10 times in Ohio in 2015 as opposed to 2,591 D&E procedures carried out in the same year. The bill has exemptions for women whose lives are in danger due to health risks, but it has no exceptions for pregnancies that are a result of rape or incest. Many fear that women will seek out more dangerous options after the bill is implemented. The <a href="http://www.ohiohouse.gov/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] will vote on the bill after returning from summer recess. </p>

<p>Abortion has been a recent issue since President Donald Trump vowed to appoint a Supreme Court justice who will overturn <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>. On Tuesday the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/opinions/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-san-francisco-law-on-deceptive-advertising-from-anti-abortion-clinics-.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a San Francisco ordinance that was implemented to halt deceptive advertising tactics employed by clinics opposed to abortion. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/georgia-top-court-bars-doctors-from-suing-over-abortion-law.php">landmark ruling</a> [JURIST report], holding that the state is immune from litigation unless it consents to being sued, rejecting a challenge to a 20-week abortion ban. Also in June the Delaware legislature <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/delaware-house-approves-bill-guaranteeing-abortion-access.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that guarantees access to abortion. The same day, Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/texas-governor-signs-abortion-regulations-into-law-1.php">signed a series of abortion regulations into law</a> [JURIST report]. In May Trump's administration <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/trump-administration-cuts-international-healthcare-aid-to-groups-promoting-or-performing-abortions--.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans to expand the so-called Mexico City Policy blocking international family planning assistance through the US Agency for International Development to any groups or programs that provide abortion or abortion education to women. Also in May Trump <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/trump-signs-law-allowing-states-to-block-abortion-provider-funding.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that scales back an Obama administration regulation that protected certain federal funds for organizations that provide abortions, including <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. In February the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/house-republicans-move-towards-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would overturn the Obama administration's rule prohibiting states from denying federal funding to Planned Parenthood and <a href="/forum/2017/02/Yvonne-Lindgren-abortion-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST op-ed] that makes permanent restrictions on federal funding abortion. In February the Pennsylvania Senate approved <a href="/paperchase/2017/02/pennsylvania-senate-approves-20-week-abortion-ban.php">SB 3</a> [JURIST report], putting Pennsylvania in line to become the seventeenth state to pass a bill banning abortions past 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/162082.P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] North Carolina's <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015/Bills/Senate/PDF/S2v4.pdf">Senate Bill 2</a> [text, PDF], which allows magistrates to refuse to perform same-sex marriages if doing so would conflict with their religious beliefs.  The court ruled that the plaintiffs, three couples, did not have standing to bring the case because they could not claim that the law hindered their marriages, and the plaintiffs claimed instead that the law affected them as taxpayers. The court wrote, "In light of the Supreme Court's admonitions on the narrow scope of taxpayer standing, we affirm the judgment of the district court that plaintiffs lack standing to press this claim."  <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/members/membersByDistrict.pl?sChamber=S&nDistrict=26">Phil Berger</a> [official profile], the Republican state senator who introduced the bill, <a href="http://www.philberger.org/federal_appeals_court_rejects_challenge_to_religious_freedom_law">said</a> [press release], "Once again, a federal court has rejected the idea that exercising one's First Amendment religious freedoms somehow infringes on others' rights&#8212;which was made clear when the plaintiffs couldn't find even one North Carolinian who was unable to get married under this law." The plaintiffs' attorney <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article158591679.html">said</a> [<em>Charlotte Observer</em> report] that the plaintiffs have not ruled out the possibility of an appeal. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/17a0136p-06.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a previous ruling that Ohio's execution protocol was unconstitutional. The prior <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/federal-judge-rejects-ohio-lethal-injection-protocol.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] had put further executions on hiatus. The <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2017/06/28/appeals-court-ruling-opens-door-ohio-resuming-executions/a7y3ny9z6y7cS6DSQfjYnJ/story.html">question</a> [AP report] was whether one of the three drugs used in the lethal injection process was sufficient to cause the inmates to lose consciousness before they are able to feel the effects of the other two drugs which stop their hearts. The eight judges of the majority wrote that the lower court had not used the Supreme Court's standard that "'the method [of execution] presents a risk that is <em>sure or<br />
very likely</em> to cause' serious pain and 'needless suffering[.]'" The majority believed that the executions carried out in Ohio did not meet this standard. Six judges dissented and agreed with the lower court that the executions should be postponed until a better method was found. Ohio may now move forward with the executions, but the defense attorney says that he is planning to appeal to the Supreme Court.  </p>

<p>The death penalty has been a pressing issue across the country. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/us-district-judge-orders-major-changes-to-arizona-death-penalty-procedures.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] major changes to Arizona death penalty procedures due to prisoner complaints. Also this month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/supreme-court-ruling-in-capital-case-mandates-psychiatric-assistance-for-indigent-defendants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that psychiatric assistance must be provided for indigent defendants sentenced to the death penalty. In May the Delaware House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/delaware-house-votes-to-reinstate-death-penalty.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would reinstate the death penalty. In March Florida governor <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/florida-governor-signs-new-death-penalty-law-requiring-unanimous-decision.php">signed a new bill</a> [JURIST report] declaring that the death penalty may only be imposed by a judge upon unanimous recommendation from the jury. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2017/01/supreme-courts-lets-alabama-death-penalty-system-stand.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to consider a challenge to Alabama's death penalty system. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lower house of the <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/en/">German Parliament</a> [official website] voted 393-226 Friday to legalize same-sex marriage. The decision came shortly after <a href="https://www.angela-merkel.de/">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website] changed her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html?_r=0">conservative stance</a> [NYT report] on the issue. Although Merkel voted against the move she encouraged lawmakers to vote with their conscience instead of along party lines. Before allowing civil unions in 2001, Germany <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-gay-marriage-idUSKBN19L0PQ">had a history</a> [Reuters report] of anti-homosexual legislation. Earlier this month the German Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2017/06/bundestag-to-compensate-5000-persecuted-under-anti-homosexuality-laws.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to compensate thousands of individuals who had been persecuted and imprisoned for their sexuality. The law under which the individuals had been convicted is <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/learn/students/learning-materials-and-resources/homosexuals-victims-of-the-nazi-era/paragraph-175">paragraph 175</a> [text] of Germany's criminal code, and was put in place in 1871. The scope of the law was broadened under the Nazi regime, and was used to convict men as recently as 1967. Homosexuality was decriminalized in West Germany in 1969. Germany is the 23rd country to legalize same-sex marriage and joins over a dozen European nations including Britain, France, Ireland and Spain. The measure was passed during Parliament's final session before summer recess. </p>

<p>In May Taiwan's constitutional court, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/en/p01_03.asp">Judicial Yuan</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2017/05/taiwan-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex marriages will be legally recognized. Despite the increase in <a href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/AUSTRALIA-POLITICS-GAYMARRIAGE/0100300Y01Z/SAMESEX-MARRIAGE.jpg">countries ruling in favor of same-sex marriage</a> [Reuters map], many are still prosecuted around the world for engaging in homosexual relationships. In April Nigerian prosecutors in Kaduna <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/nigeria-charges-53-with-unlawful-society-for-celebrating-lgbtq-wedding.php">charged 53 men</a> [JURIST report] for celebrating an LGBTQ wedding in violation of the state's law against 'unlawful assembly' and the <a href="http://www.placng.org/new/laws/Same%20Sex%20Marriage%20%28Prohibition%29%20Act,%202013.pdf">Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act</a> [text]. A day earlier the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] and other advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/hrw-calls-for-un-investigation-into-lgbt-rights-abuses-in-chechnya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] UN Secretary General to investigate alleged abuse against LGBT people in Chechnya. According to the open letter about 100 gay and bisexual men have been detained, went missing, were tortured, or were murdered under the authority of Chechen officials. Also in April A UK high court <a href="/paperchase/2017/04/uk-court-stays-citizens-extradition-to-turkey-based-on-safety-concerns.php">stayed the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of a gay British man, Rosslee Charles, to Turkey given concerns over his safety. In March Germany <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/EN/FederalGovernment/Cabinet/HeikoMaas/_node.html">Justice Minister Heiko Maas</a> [official profile] announced that the country's cabinet has <a href="/paperchase/2017/03/germany-cabinet-approves-measure-to-compensate-men-convicted-under-anti-gay-law.php">approved a measure</a> [JURIST report] to pardon and provide compensation to approximately 50,000 men convicted under a Nazi-era law against homosexuality.</p>]]></content:encoded>
