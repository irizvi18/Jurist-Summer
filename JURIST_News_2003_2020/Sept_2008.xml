		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A lawsuit filed Wednesday in US <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] challenges the latest version of a <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/">Farmers Branch</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=farmers+branch">news archive</a>] municipal ordinance which prohibits illegal immigrants from occupying leased property. In the <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-txndce/case_no-3:2008cv01551/case_id-179724/">lawsuit</a> [case materials] against the Dallas suburb, several landlords and a former City Council member seek to enjoin enforcement of <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/Communication/Ordinance%20No%202952.doc">Ordinance 2952</a> [DOC text], which is scheduled to take effect Sept. 13. The plaintiffs claim it is unconstitutional because it violates the Supremacy Clause by regulating <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] and denies immigrants equal protection and due process rights. Anyone wishing to rent a single-family residence would be required to obtain an occupancy license, and the city building inspector would submit information from these license applications to a federal database, the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=1721c2ec0c7c8110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=1721c2ec0c7c8110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program</a> (SAVE) [official website], to determine the applicants&#39; immigration status. This ordinance is different from prior versions because it relies on the federal government, rather than on landlords, to determine applicants&#39; status. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-xTc98lY6M1x5NFKu7z8ixOo-zQD92VJCO80">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Dallas Morning News</span> has <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/tv/stories/DN-fbordinance_04met.ART0.Central.Edition1.4d7ad65.html">local coverage</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</span> has <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/state_news/story/882735.html">additional local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In May, US <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judges/lindsay.html">District Judge Sam Lindsay</a> [official profile] finalized a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-federal-court-strikes-down-law.php">holding</a> [JURIST report] that an earlier law, <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/Communication/Ordinance%20No%202903.doc">Ordinance 2903</a> [DOC text], was unconstitutional. The Farmers Branch <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/CityCouncil/CityCouncil.html">City Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dallas-suburb-approves-new-rental.php">passed the current ordinance</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to cure the flaws identified by Lindsay, and the city has been defending the ordinances since an initial version was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/dallas-suburb-passes-tough-anti.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006. More than 50 other US municipalities have contemplated similar laws, and last year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-pennsylvania.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two Hazleton, Pennsylvania ordinances designed to prevent illegal immigrants from living or working in the town.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The administration of Bolivian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.bo/">President Evo Morales</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3203752.stm">profile</a>] is refusing to recognize a <a href="http://www.cne.org.bo/">National Electoral Court</a> (CNE) [official website] decision suspending a constitutional referendum <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-sets-date-for.php">set for Dec. 7</a> [JURIST report]. Nationalization Minister Hector Arce <a href="http://abi.bo/index.php?i=noticias_texto_paleta&j=20080902012002&l=200805300001_El_ministro_de_Defensa_Legal,_H%E9ctor_Arce,_en_conferencia_de_prensa_(Archivo).">said</a> [ABI report, in Spanish] Monday that letters sent to Morales by CNE President Jose Luis Exeni purporting to suspend the referendum have no legal effect. The administration ratified Morales&#39; <a href="http://www.derechoteca.com/gacetabolivia/decreto-supremo-29691-del-28-agosto-2008.htm">decree</a> [text] scheduling the referendum, and demanded CNE compliance. Sacha Llorenti, deputy minister for social movements, defended Morales&#39; decree as &quot;respond[ing] not only to a historical necessity for the Bolivian people to decide if it wants a new Constitution, but ... also based on constitutional principles and laws of the Republic.&quot; [sic] AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5icZrFuWnQi36L3-KJnSKwKf-9Y5gD92UCA6O0">more</a>. From La Paz, <span style="font-style:italic;">La Razon</span> has <a href="http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20080902_006383/nota_249_663011.htm">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />If approved, the proposed constitutional amendments would distribute more of Bolivia&#39;s land and energy resource income to the country&#39;s indigenous population. Morales said that last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-holds-presidential-confidence.php">national referendum</a> permitting him to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">retain his office</a> provided the authority for him to push for the constitutional changes. Several of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-autonomy-referendum-approved-by.php">provincial governors also confirmed</a> by the referendum <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-constitution-reforms-called.php">oppose the plan</a> [JURIST reports] and said they would not hold the December vote in their regions, leading to Monday&#39;s CNE decision. The referendum on the new draft constitution, which had originally been <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bolivia-court-halts-referendum-on-new.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report], was narrowly approved in February by the <a href="http://www.constituyente.bo/">Bolivian Constitutional Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] amid reports that Morales supporters prevented many draft opponents from entering the constitutional building to participate in the vote.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0333p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on a suit brought by several Kentucky environmental groups, including a chapter of the <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a> [advocacy website], against <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Administrator/biography.htm">Stephen L. Johnson</a> [EPA bio] in his official capacity as Administrator of the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website].  The plaintiffs filed suit under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> [text], seeking to compel Johnson to fulfill his duty to implement antidegradation requirements for Kentucky. In a complex order, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court&#8217;s grant of summary judgment to the EPA on the challenge to the EPA&#8217;s approval of Kentucky&#8217;s selection of regulated waters, reversed the grant of summary judgment to the EPA on the its approval of Kentucky&#8217;s exemption of six types of pollution discharges from review, and remanded the matter to the EPA. Judge Clay authored the opinion, stating &quot;In my view, the EPA acted contrary to law by relying on [Kentucky&#39;s] unenforceable commitments.&quot;<br /><br />In recent months, the EPA has been sued by a number of states seeking either the promulgation of regulations or effective response to petitions.  In August, twelve states <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/aug/aug25b_08.html">filed suit</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/states-sue-epa-over-clean-air-act.php">report</a>] against the EPA for its alleged failure to enforce provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85.html">Clean Air Act</a> [text; EPA <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/oaq_caa.html/">materials</a>] requiring oil refineries to adopt measures curbing the pollution contributing to global warming. In July, California Attorney General <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] formally <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1594_final_180_day_notice.pdf">notified</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1594">press release</a>] the EPA that the state had petitioned the EPA three times seeking a regulatory ruling and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/california-threatens-to-sue-epa-over.php">would file a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the agency if it refused to issue rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from various vehicles and types of machinery.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/DDD93715D46EA3F7882574B90050E3DD/$file/0755368.pdf?openelement">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court&#39;s grant of summary judgment to retailer <a href="http://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> in a copyright infringement action brought by watch manufacturer <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/">Omega</a> [corporate websites]. Omega claimed that Costco&#39;s unauthorized sale of its imported watches constituted infringing distribution and importation.  The decision turned on whether the US Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1470.ZS.html">Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L&#8217;anza Research International, Inc.</a> [LII materials] required the Ninth Circuit to overrule its precedents that the &quot;first sale doctrine&quot; raised by Costco as a defense provides no protection against an infringement claim involving <blockquote>(1) foreign-made, nonpiratical copies of a U.S.- copyrighted work, (2) unless those same copies have already been sold in the United States with the copyright owner&#8217;s authority.</blockquote> The Ninth Circuit held that the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling could be reconciled with its own case law:<blockquote>Perhaps most compelling is the objection that [the precedent] would provide substantially greater copyright protection to foreign-made copies of U.S.-copyrighted works. A U.S. copyright owner, for example, would be unable to exercise distribution rights after one lawful, domestic sale of a watch lawfully made in South Dakota, but, without the limits imposed by [the first sale doctrine], the same owner could seemingly exercise distribution rights after even the tenth sale in the United States of a watch lawfully made in Switzerland. The difference would likely encourage U.S. copyright owners to outsource the manufacturing of copies of their work overseas. [The Court has] resolved this problem by clarifying that parties can raise [the defense] in cases involving foreign-made copies so long as a lawful domestic sale has occurred. Insofar as Costco contends that [the doctrine] should apply to foreign made copies even in the absence of a lawful domestic sale, the surviving rule...requires otherwise. [citations omitted]</blockquote>The court went on to find that &quot;Because there is no genuine dispute that Omega made the copies of the Omega Globe Design in Switzerland, and that Costco sold them in the United States without Omega&#8217;s authority, the first sale doctrine is unavailable as a defense to Omega&#8217;s claims.&quot;<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <u>Quality King</u> had reversed the Ninth Circuit&#39;s rejection of the first sale defense, holding that &quot;The whole point of the first sale doctrine is that once the copyright owner places a copyrighted item in the stream of commerce by selling it, he has exhausted his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution.&quot; Wednesday&#39;s ruling does not fall squarely under that precedent, because while Omega&#39;s watches were produced abroad, the goods in <u>Quality King</u> had been produced in the US, exported, and then returned to the US for domestic sale. The first sale doctrine lies within Section 109(a) of the <a href="http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/socl/law/CopyrightActof1976/Chap1.html">1976 Copyright Act</a> [text], and its application is murky in such transactions, which are said to occur on the <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-gray-market.htm">&quot;gray market&quot;</a> [backgrounder] and involve the resale of goods with US trademarks or copyrights.

The lawsuit, brought by conservative Christian legal advocacy group <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/main/default.aspx">Alliance Defense Fund</a> [advocacy website], asked the court to declare that Governor Paterson&#39;s May 14, 2008 Executive Directive recognizing such marriages &quot;contravenes New York law&quot; and asked the court to &quot;permanently enjoin the Directive&#39;s enforcement, because it exceeds the Governor&#39;s lawful authority.&quot; In dismissing the lawsuit, Judge Billings wrote <blockquote>Governor Paterson&#39;s Executive Directive dated May 14, 2008, requiring state agencies to recognize same sex marriages legally solemnized in other jurisdictions is consistent with New York&#39;s common law, statutory law, and constitutional separation of powers regarding recognition of marriages legally solemnized outside New York. ... The court therefore denies the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the amended petition and grants respondents&#39; motions to dismiss this proceeding.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5grygnggpvdxoXHz6K6u0f9CUtsPQD92UUD8O3">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Office of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a> [JURIST news archive] Tuesday to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27894&Cr=iran&Cr1=">ban the use of the death penalty</a> [UN News Centre report] against juvenile offenders. The OHCHR statement comes as two Iranian men, identified by Reuters as Mohammad Fadaaee and Amir Amrollahi, are set to be executed for crimes committed while juveniles. The OHCHR also expressed stated that it was &quot;<a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/C00500AB76954761C12574B800509EFF?OpenDocument#human_rights">concerned and saddened</a>&quot; [OHCHR press briefing] by the August executions of two other Iranian juvenile offenders, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-executes-man-for-crime-he.php">Reza Hedjazi</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/26/iran19697.htm">Behnam Zaare</a> [HRW report]. Iranian executions of juveniles violate the terms of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/child.html">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text], to which Iran is a signatory, but officials for the country argue that it and similar executions are allowed because the offenders reached the age of majority before being executed. <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">said</a> [HRW press release] that Iran leads the world in executing the most people for crimes committed as children and advocacy campaign Stop Child Executions keeps a <a href="http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx">list</a> [advocacy materials] of those facing execution. Last April, an Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE14/014/2007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/iraq-execution-rate-now-worlds-fourth.php">report</a>] named Iran as having one of the three highest execution rates in the world, along with China and Pakistan. Reuters has <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L2713600.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-stops-use-of-stoning-as-method-of.php">commuted the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of four people scheduled to be executed by stoning and suspended the use of the punishment, after nine people were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm">given the sentence</a> [BBC report] in July for adultery and sexual offenses despite a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/iran-to-investigate-judge-who-ordered.php">moratorium on the practice</a> [JURIST report]. In July, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iran-executions-increasing-in-number.php">hanged 29 people</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran in a move that human rights groups suggested was intended to challenge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-stoning.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report] of its death penalty policies. Most executions in the country are carried out by hanging and are related to such crimes as murder and rape, although an Iranian airport customs officer was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp.php">executed for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in January.

Oral arguments in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=ru&case=132&k=95">case</a> [ICJ materials] began Tuesday, when Bogdan Aurescu, director general of Romania&#39;s Foreign Affairs Ministry, argued that the Ukrainian government was unfairly trying to use tiny Serpent Island to expand the area of the Black Sea available to the Ukraine for exploitation. He said that because Ukraine inherited the land from the Soviet Union, which illegally annexed it, the island should not be considered in fixing a boundary. The court must decide on a starting point for the border and on a methodology for drawing it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi government announced plans Wednesday to rebuild <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive], where US military guards were <a href="/paperchase/2004/04/outrage-grows-over-images-of-alleged.htm">photographed abusing Iraqi prisoners</a> [JURIST report]. Government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the <a href="http://www.cabinet.iq/">Iraqi Cabinet</a> [official website, in Arabic] had approved the Defense Ministry&#39;s proposal to reopen the prison west of Baghdad. US authorities <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/us-empties-abu-ghraib-prison-iraqi.php">emptied Abu Ghraib of its final 2,000 prisoners</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-military-returns-abu-ghraib-prison.php">returned it to Iraqi control</a> [JURIST reports] in late 2006. The new Abu Ghraib is to incorporate a museum depicting crimes committed during the regime of <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], when the prison was feared as a site of torture and executions. A timeline for the project has not yet been established. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hPWLg5G3S39qAuzQn4a2cSkWCkkw">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-35300320080903">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />A Human Rights Watch report asserted that US commanders <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/us-commanders-authorized-widespread.php">authorized widespread torture of prisoners</a> [JURIST report] during and even after photos of guards abusing inmates surfaced in the media. Former Abu Ghraib commander Janis Karpinski said in 2005 that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] personally <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/former-abu-ghraib-general-says.php">signed a memorandum authorizing extreme interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST report]. Several US soldiers were convicted of abuse at Abu Ghraib, including former US Army Reserve Staff Sgt. Ivan &quot;Chip&quot; Frederick, who was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-soldier-jailed-for-abu-ghraib.php">paroled</a> [JURIST report] in late 2007 after serving three years in prison. The conviction of the only commissioned officer charged in connection with the abuse was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/conviction-of-abu-ghraib-officer-thrown.php">annulled</a> [JURIST report] early this year. A number of lawsuits are pending against US military contractors for alleged abuses at Abu Ghraib, including one <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ex-abu-ghraib-detainees-sue-military.php">filed this July</a> [JURIST report] by four former prisoners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Defence of Human Rights Chairman Khalid Khawaja <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C09%5C03%5Cstory_3-9-2008_pg7_51">petitioned the Islamabad High Court</a> [<em>Daily Times</em> report] on Wednesday to register abduction charges against Pakistan&#39;s former president <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] and several other high-ranking officials from his administration.  The petition alleges that the officials instituted false proceedings against Khawaja, leading to his abduction and detention without cause. Khawaja has publicly dedicated himself to finding people allegedly abducted by the Pakistani government, and was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6385615.stm">jailed</a> [BBC News report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-releases-thousands-of-detained.php">report</a>] in 2007. The prosecution&#39;s initial submissions to the court contained <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?167369">allegations</a> [<em>PakTribune</em> report] that he worked with terrorist groups and promoted sectarianism.<br /><br />Following his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] last month, Musharraf <a href="http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/12219">denied having committed any crimes</a> [ANI report] in a televised address, but speculation that he might leave the country to avoid criminal prosecution prompted US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to announce that the US would not grant him asylum. Shortly before the resignation, <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [official websites] coalition leaders finalized a separate <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">impeachment charge sheet</a> [JURIST report] against Musharraf, outlining misuses of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges. In June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<title>Tenth Circuit holds consultant liable for false SEC filings</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%2210th+circuit%22">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/06/06-4035.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a non-employee consultant may be held liable for misstatements or omissions in periodic financial reports filed with the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/sec.php">news archive</a>]. The ruling affirms a district court decision <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr19482.htm">granting summary judgment</a> [SEC press release] in a civil enforcement action against Jon R. Marple and consulting firm Grateful Internet Associates LLC, whom the SEC charged with violating anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000078---j000-.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/77q.html">Securities Act of 1933</a> and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=efda28908fe43c862d954d9e2c69e832&rgn=div8&view=text&node=17:3.0.1.1.1.1.57.71&idno=17">SEC regulations</a> [text]. The SEC alleged that Marple drafted false filings for a public company, F10 Oil and Gas Properties Inc., in which he otherwise played a major role despite his status as a consultant. Marple argued that, as a consultant, he could not be held primarily liable because he did not &quot;directly or indirectly engage in any manipulative or deceptive acts.&quot; <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1434">Circuit Judge Carlos F. Lucero</a> [official profile] wrote for the three-judge panel:  <blockquote>Specifically, they [defendants] claim that the Commission showed only that F10 made the material misstatements or omissions, not that they as individuals &quot;made&quot; such misstatements or omissions. Marple and Grateful were, according to their theory, mere secondary actors subject at most to liability as aidors and abettors. ...<br /><br />The relevant question is only whether he can fairly be said to have caused F10 to make the relevant statements, and whether he knew or should have known that the statements would reach investors. ... Under the facts discussed, this standard was satisfied. We thus hold that because Marple caused the misstatements and omissions to be made, and knew that the statements were calculated to reach investors, defendants can properly be held liable.... </blockquote>In addition to ruling against the defendants on their substantive arguments, the panel also rejected their claim that the district court erred procedurally. Marple was among 21 individuals and entities whom the SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18413.htm">alleged</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18413.htm">press release</a>] were part of &quot;a scheme to sell securities in five United States-based microcap issuers to hundreds of investors located primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand through a boiler room located in Vientiane, Laos.&quot; In addition to various other consequences, Marple and his firm were ordered to disgorge $149,487 plus interest and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.<br /><br />In July, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA3LTExMDQtY3Jfb3BuLnBkZg==/07-1104-cr_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl27cf/2/hilite">held</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/breaking-securities-rules-not-enough-to.php">report</a>] that knowingly violating exchange regulations and subsequently trying to conceal one&#39;s actions does not constitute criminal securities fraud.  The court held that the actions themselves must be deceptive, and must be intended to defraud customers.  The ruling affirmed the district court&#39;s reversal of the conviction of David Finnerty, a former specialist trader at Fleet Specialist Inc., a subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corp., who had been accused of making improper trades for his firm&#8217;s account on the <a href="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) [official website] by &#8220;interpositioning,&#8221; a process in which brokers step in front of their customers to intercept trades at more favorable prices.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.ice.gov">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] has <a href="http://www.freesamialarian.com/sami_isout.htm">released</a> [advocacy group press release] Arab activist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sami+al-Arian">Sami Al-Arian</a> [JURIST news archive] after five years in federal custody. The former <a href="http://www.usf.edu/">University of South Florida</a> (USF) [official website]  computer science professor will remain under electronic monitoring pending trial on <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-al-arian-sentenced-to-18.php">contempt charges</a> [JURIST report] for refusing to testify before grand juries that were investigating a group of Islamic charities. ICE released al-Arian on Tuesday, the deadline set last week by US <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=261">District Judge Leonie Brinkema</a> [official profile] for the government to respond to al-Arian&#39;s <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petition by justifying his continued detention. Brinkema <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/al-arian-could-remain-in-custody.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] to Al-Arian last month, finding that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, but ICE then took him into custody. The <a href="http://www.mpac.org/">Muslim Public Affairs Council</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=686">statement</a> [text] welcoming al-Arian&#39;s release, characterizing his case as &quot;an example of what many American Muslims perceived to be numerous post-9/11 political persecutions of individuals using tactics that amount to little more than guilt by association.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hGZ2aZa4OGdGFARd4aivYqlHWniwD92USLH03">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/criminal/article794138.ece">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />Al-Arian was <a href="/paperchase/2003/02/background-on-palestinian-usf.php">arrested in February 2003</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/alarian/usalarian0203ind.pdf">indicted</a> [PDF text] on charges of supporting terrorism based on comments he made in the wake of 9/11 and his association with an Islamic think tank at USF in the 1990s.  In 2005 he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/breaking-news-ex-professor-acquitted.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] on eight of 17 terrorism charges. The next year he <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/ex-professor-to-plead-guilty-to-terror.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to one charge of conspiring to provide services to the <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/pij.cfm">Palestinian Islamic Jihad</a> [CDI backgrounder] in violation of US law and agreed to be deported after serving a 57-month sentence. In granting bail to al-Arian, Brinkema expressed concern that the government was interfering with the plea agreement by preventing his deportation in order to hold the contempt trial. Last year an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-appeals-court-affirms-civil.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the contempt charges.

Written by <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/glennfine.htm">Inspector General Glenn A. Fine</a> [official profile], the report noted that although Gonzales&#39; conduct might have violated federal criminal <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001924----000-.html">statutes</a> [text] as well, the DOJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/nsd/">National Security Division</a> [official website] declined to pursue the matter. The allegations, referred to the by the head of the National Security Division in August 2007, initially involved the handling of Gonzales&#39; handwritten notes pertaining to a warrantless domestic <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive] run by the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website]. The OIG investigation expanded to include Office of Legal Counsel opinions regarding the surveillance program and interrogations of <a href="/currentawareness/detainees.php">detainees</a> [JURIST news archive], as well as memoranda related to both programs, and correspondence from congressional leaders. The OIG report stated: <blockquote>In sum, our investigation concluded that Gonzales mishandled classified materials regarding two highly sensitive compartmented programs. We found that Gonzales took his classified handwritten notes home and stored them there for an indeterminate period of time. The notes contained operational aspects and other information about the NSA surveillance program that is classified at the TS/SCI level. By regulation, such material must be stored in a Sensitive Compartmented Storage Facility (SCIF). At the time he took these materials home, Gonzales did not have a SCIF at his house. Although Gonzales did have a safe at his residence at this time, we found that he did not use it to store the notes.<br /><br />We also found that Gonzales improperly stored other highly classified documents about the two compartmented programs in a safe at the Department that was not located in a SCIF. Several employees in the OAG had access to the safe where Gonzales stored the documents even though they lacked the necessary security clearances for this information. We concluded that Gonzales&#8217;s mishandling of both the notes and the other classified documents violated Department security requirements and procedures.</blockquote> The OIG found that Gonzales&#39; handling of the documents violated an <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12958.html">executive order</a> [text] prescribing standards for <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RL33494.pdf">classified national security information</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF], as well as DOJ <a href="http://law.justia.com/us/cfr/title28/28-1.0.1.1.18.html">regulations</a> [text]. In response, Gonzales&#39; attorney <a href="http://www.whitecase.com/gterwilliger/">George Terwilliger</a> [firm profile] released a 19-page memorandum [PDF text] denying that Gonzales had caused any unauthorized release of classified information: <blockquote>We also submit that the Report demonstrates that Judge Gonzales&#39; best recollection is that he always placed the Notes in the most secure place over which he had immediate personal control. While the Report provides a basis to conclude that information made available to Judge Gonzales would indicate that the safe was not a proper storage place for the Notes or other SCI material, we submit that a fair assessment of the facts does not support a conclusion that Judge Gonzales consciously knew that the safe was inadequate because it was not in a sensitive compartmented information facility (&quot;SCIF&quot;) and acted in contravention to that knowledge.</blockquote> Gonzales <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/gonzales-leaves-justice-department-as.php">left office last year</a> [JURIST report] amid controversy surrounding the firings of several US Attorneys and subsequent allegations that he might have perjured himself while testifying on the matter before Congress. Gonzales <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/former-us-ag-gonzales-hires-counsel-as.php">retained Terwilliger</a> [JURIST report] last year to represent him during the investigation of the perjury allegations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazilian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.br/ingles/">President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> [official website, English version] has placed senior officials of the intelligence service <a href="http://www.abin.gov.br/">Abin</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on suspension pending investigations of a report that its agents <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/brazil-supreme-court-chief-wiretapped.php">wiretapped a variety of high-ranking government figures</a> [JURIST report]. Silva removed Abin Director <a href="http://www.abin.gov.br/modules/mastop_publish/?tac=Conheca_o_Diretor-Geral">Paulo Lacerda</a> [official profile] and Deputy Director Jose Milton Campana on Monday after meeting with the defense and justice ministers and with <a href="http://www.stf.gov.br/">Supreme Federal Court</a> [official website] president Gilmar Mendes, one of the officials who was allegedly affected. Silva also directed the <a href="http://www.mj.gov.br/">Justice Ministry</a> [official website, in Portuguese] to begin its own investigation, in addition to those being conducted by Abin and Congress, and to propose a law punishing security agents who commit invasions of privacy. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g_O10-8aw3a7RysijVaQsWF6o-uQD92U8N0G0">more</a>.

Paolo</span> has <a href="http://www.estadao.com.br/estadaodehoje/20080902/not_imp234652,0.php">local coverage</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://vejaonline.abril.com.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=1">Veja</a> [media website], a Brazilian weekly newsmagazine, made the wiretapping allegations in an <a href="http://veja.abril.com.br/030908/p_064.shtml">article</a> in its latest issue, published late last week. Aside from Mendes, the officials said to have been wiretapped also include Silva&#39;s chief of staff and several members of Congress. The reason for the alleged wiretaps remains unclear, although Brazilian media speculate that they may have been undertaken in connection with the local elections seen as possible bellwethers for the chances of Lula&#39;s party in the country&#39;s 2010 presidential election.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand&#39;s <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/thai/default.html">Election Commission</a> [official website, in Thai] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130268">voted to recommend</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] that the country&#39;s ruling People&#39;s Power Party (PPP) be disbanded for election fraud allegedly committed by one of its former top officers. The five-member panel voted unanimously after finding that the party was complicit in a vote-buying scheme devised by former deputy leader Yongyuth Tiyapairat. Yongyuth was <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090708_News/09Jul2008_news03.php">convicted of the crime</a>&nbsp;[Bangkok Post report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Consitutional Court</a> [official website, in Thai] in July. The EC&#39;s recommendation will be sent to the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ago.go.th/">Attorney General</a> [official website, in Thai], and if approved, will be brought before the Constitutional Court within 30 days. If disbanded, a number of high-ranking government officials, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile], would lose their positions and be barred from political office for five years.

The measures came <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130281">in reaction to demonstrations</a> held by the pro-government Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship (DAAD) and opposition People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) parties. <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130298">Criticized</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> reports] by lawyers&#39; and journalists&#39; groups, the declaration is the first of its kind in the country and has been <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130302">challenged</a> in the country&#39;s Supreme Administrative Court.  PAD members have <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130302">refused to recognize the order</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] and have demanded Samak&#39;s resignation. Xinhua has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/02/content_9755264.htm">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080902/ap_on_re_as/thailand_political_unrest">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />PAD announced its plans to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">seek Samak&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] in July after  a series of court decisions against key officials in the government and the PPP.  The PPP has also been closely associated with former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], now on trial for corruption. PAD members have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-protesters-accuse-authorities.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] delays in Thaksin&#39;s various corruption trials, and the <a href="http://nccc.thaigov.net/nccc/eng.php">National Counter Corruption Commission</a> (NCCC) [official website] said that it may bring more charges against Thaksin without waiting for the <a href="http://www.ago.go.th/">Office of the Attorney General</a> [official website, in Thai] to file additional indictments.

Francisco Franco. Garzon ordered government agencies, the <a href="http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/">Episcopal Conference</a> [church website], the <a href="http://www.ugr.es/ugr/index.php">University of Granada</a> [academic website] and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. The investigation will help determine whether the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/jt/principal.htm">National Court</a> [official website] has jurisdiction over the complaints filed by 13 &quot;associations for the recovery of historical memory&quot; seeking clarification of the victims&#39; whereabouts. Such a determination could help the victims&#39; survivors obtain government compensation. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jSfTv7CwTtW2gsbC1F9qhyBR1u8wD92U7B280">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> (NAB) [official website] is seeking to reopen corruption cases against <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/profile.php">former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [party profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] and his brother, said the NAB&#39;s Deputy Prosecutor General Zulfiqar Ahmed Bhutta on Tuesday. Bhutta said the NAB had filed an application in Accountability Court IV in Rawalpindi asking the court to reverse last month&#39;s decision to <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C08%5C22%5Cstory_22-8-2008_pg7_48">adjourn the cases indefinitely</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span> report]. Judge Khalid Mehmood suspended the cases on technical grounds, ruling that a prior application to reinstate them should have been signed by the NAB chairman. Nawaz Sharif and his brother <a href="http://www.shahbazsharif.net/">Shahbaz Sharif</a> [personal website], chief minister of Punjab province, faced charges including money laundering and accumulating wealth beyond declared sources of income. The court is scheduled to consider the NAB application on Thursday. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iWe152N60O8rfHfthVTBaXBeBs3wD92UIRKG0">more</a>.

Musharraf <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] last month, largely to avoid impeachment for the judges&#39; dismissals and other alleged abuses of authority, and an election to replace him is scheduled for Saturday. On Monday, the head of an organization called Save the Judiciary <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\09\02\story_2-9-2008_pg7_6">filed a petition</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span> report; <span style="font-style:italic;">Dawn</span> <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/02/nat4.htm">report</a>] in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Pakistani Supreme Court</a> [official website], seeking to have the election delayed because <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">acting president Mohammedmian Soomro</a> [official website] allegedly did not take the oath of office as prescribed in the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">Pakistani Constitution</a> [PDF text].

RIA Novosti quoted Khorkovsky lawyer Semyon Rozenberg as saying that &quot;The documents have been sent to the district court, but have not been received yet.&quot; Khodorkovsky, a longtime political opponent of former President and now Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, filed the request in July, four months after Dmitry Medvedev took over as president on a platform of <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-vows-reforms-to-rid.php">fighting corruption and fostering a more independent judiciary</a> [JURIST report]. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080901/116437823.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Khodorkovsky was sent to prison by the Russian government in 2005 to serve an eight-year sentence for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], charges which he still denies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/transitpage.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECJ">news archive</a>] has <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=Rechercher$docrequire=alldocs&numaff=C-402/05%20P&datefs=&datefe=&nomusuel=&domaine=&mots=&resmax=100">ruled</a> [case materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080060en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] that the EU violated the fundamental property rights of a Saudi business and a Swedish foundation linked to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] by freezing their assets without giving them a hearing. The EU&#39;s highest court on Wednesday reversed a 2005 Court of First Instance decision <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/european-court-rules-eu-can-freeze.php">dismissing complaints</a> [JURIST report] brought by Yassin Abdullah Kadi and the Al Barakaat International Foundation, whose bank accounts were frozen in 2001. Although the ECJ agreed with the lower chamber that the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?lang=EN">European Council</a> [official website] had the authority to adopt a <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:139:0009:0022:EN:PDF">regulation</a> [PDF text] allowing such seizures, it found that EU courts had jurisdiction to review the measure and, further, that Kadi and Al Barakaat had a right to effective judicial review. According to the ECJ opinion, <blockquote>the contested regulation, in so far as it concerns the appellants, was adopted without any guarantee being given as to the communication of the inculpatory evidence against them or as to their being heard in that connection, so that it must be found that that regulation was adopted according to a procedure in which the appellants&#39; rights of defence were not observed, which has had the further consequence that the principle of effective judicial protection has been infringed.<br /><br />It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the pleas in law raised by Mr Kadi and Al Barakaat in support of their actions for annulment of the contested regulation and alleging breach of their rights of defence, especially the right to be heard, and of the principle of effective judicial protection, are well founded. </blockquote> The ECJ gave the council three months in which to cure the defects in the regulation. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAMXGqECTs2LTOzVnLNSQCyBqPhQD92V8LDG0">more</a>.   The <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</span> has <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92a02990-79c9-11dd-bb93-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Other groups and individuals have successfully challenged similar measures in the EU courts. Earlier this year, some European Parliament members <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/europe-lawmakers-call-for-eu-terror.php">criticized the watch list</a> [JURIST report] as unfair and opaque, saying that the process for adding names to the list should be changed. In July 2007, the Court of First Instance <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/eu-court-overturns-asset-freeze-orders.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] an EU decision freezing the assets of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman and the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa Foundation, finding that the EC did not give the plaintiffs an opportunity to challenge the legal basis for their inclusion on a terrorist watch list. In December 2006, the same court similarly <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/eu-court-annuls-asset-freeze-on-iran.php">annulled an asset freeze</a> [JURIST report] against the People&#39;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran. That judgment prompted the European Council to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/eu-overhauls-terror-blacklist.php">revise the procedures</a> [JURIST report] used in establishing and maintaining the EU&#39;s terror list.

The PML-N <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">withdrew from the coalition government</a> [JURIST report] late last month following disagreements over whether to reinstate all judges ousted by former President <A src="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</A> [JURIST news archive].

Xinhua has <A HREF="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/06/content_9811433.htm">additional coverage</A>.<br /><br />Zardari previously spent over eleven years in prison for allegations of misconduct during his wife&#39;s tenure as prime minister, although <A src="/paperchase/2008/03/pakistan-court-drops-corruption-charges.php">corruption</A> and <A src="/paperchase/2008/05/pakistan-court-clears-bhutto-widower-of.php">smuggling charges</A> [JURIST reports] against him were dismissed earlier this year. Zardari and Bhutto were suspected of using Swiss bank accounts to launder up to $12 million paid by companies that were contracted with the Pakistani government to perform customs inspections. Under the <A HREF="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">Pakistani Constitution of 1973</A>, the president must be a Muslim, be at least thirty-five years old, and is elected by a electoral college composed of members of the Pakistani Senate, National Assembly, and Provincial Assemblies for a term of five years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French judge on Monday ordered the <a href="http://www.scientologie.tm.fr/">Spiritual Association of the Church of Scientology</a> (ASES - Celebrity Centre) [church website, in French] to appear before the <a href="http://www.paris.fr/portail/Culture/Portal.lut?page_id=6028&document_type_id=5&document_id=12913&portlet_id=13502">Paris Magistrates Court</a> [official website, in French] to face criminal charges. ASES has been unsuccessfully prosecuted in French courts before, and it along with an affiliated bookstore and seven church members must now defend against charges of organized fraud and the illegal practice of pharmacy. Prosecutors had asked the judge to drop the case, which originated in 1998 with a complaint from a woman who had spent about 200,000 francs ($42,600 US) on classes, books, medication and an <a href="http://www.e-meter.org.uk/page06.htm">electrometer</a> [church backgrounder] after Scientologists stopped her on a Paris street and offered her a free personality test. Another individual and a French pharmacists&#39; association later became involved in the case. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iPCY9s7qIK96sCXP0x0Xf-2RM7aw ">more</a>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> has <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2008/09/08/l-eglise-de-scientologie-renvoyee-devant-le-tribunal-correctionnel-de-paris_1092629_0.html">local coverage</a>, in French.<br /><br />In 2002, a French court ordered the <a href="http://www.scientology.org/">Church of Scientology</a> [church website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=scientology">news archive</a>] to <a href="http://www.cesnur.org/2002/scient_may.htm">pay a fine</a> [AP report] for failing to protect members&#39; personal information, but acquitted the organization of attempted fraud and false advertising. The court refused to dissolve the Paris branch of the church, as prosecutors had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1836812.stm">requested</a> [BBC report], but France&#39;s judicial system has not yet recognized Scientology as a religion. That trial followed a report released by a French government committee in 2000 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/635986.stm">recommending that Scientology be banned</a> [BBC report] as a &quot;totalitarian&quot; sect that disrupts public order. Scientology, founded by American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard in 1954, has come under increasing scrutiny in other European countries as well. Last year, the German interior minister <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/germany-working-to-ban-unconstitutional.php">suggested a ban on Scientology</a> [JURIST report] as &quot;an organization that is not compatible with the constitution.&quot; Also last year, a Belgian prosecutor who completed a 10-year investigation of the church&#39;s activities said Scientology should be <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/belgian-prosecutor-recommends.php">classified as a criminal organization</a> [JURIST report].

		<title>Israel cabinet backs bill restricting Supreme Court review power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Israeli cabinet on Sunday voted 13-11 in support of a bill to restrict the ability of the <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Israeli Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Hebrew] to overturn laws passed by the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/index.html">Knesset</a> [official website] and granting the Knesset authority to revise laws overturned by the court.  The controversial measure, <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/israel-justice-minister-supports.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] last year by <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Personalities/From+A-Z/Daniel+Friedmann.htm">Israeli Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann</a> [official profile], would provide the first statutory guide on the Supreme Court&#39;s annulment power.  Currently, that power is interpreted to reach all Knesset-passed measures deemed to contravene one of the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod1.htm">Basic Laws</a> [text]; the proposed bill would reduce that scope to allow Supreme Court annulment only of those laws contravening the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm">Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty</a> and <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic4_eng.htm">Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation</a> [text].  The proposal would also grant the Knesset authority to revise laws overturned by the Supreme Court, thereby renewing those laws&#39; validity. In those cases, the Knesset could overturn a Supreme Court ruling with an ordinary one-round of voting rather than the 61-vote majority in the 120-member body in three rounds of voting currently required to overturn the Supreme Court.  The bill will next be considered by the Knesset&#39;s <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/committees/eng/committee_eng.asp?c_id=6">Constitution, Law and Justice Committee</a> [official website].  <span style="font-style:italic;">Haaretz</span> has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1018845.html">more</a>.  Ynetnews has <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3593071,00.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The bill, purportedly based on the Canadian model of judicial review which allows the legislature to protect some laws from review under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text; see especially s. 33], has been strongly opposed by members of judicial community.  <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1998/9/Meir+Shamgar.htm">Meir Shamgar</a> [official profile], the president of the Israeli Supreme Court between 1983 and 1995, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/former-israel-supreme-court-head.php">signed a public petition</a> [JURIST report] against the proposal, arguing that &quot;abolishing substantive judicial review endangers the freedoms that have been legislated to date...[and will not] advance the rule of law&quot; but erode it because &quot;a majority of Knesset members&quot; could, at any time, restrict fundamental freedoms granted to Israeli citizens.  Proponents of the bill, including <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Israeli Prime Minster Ehud Olmert</a> [official profile], argue that the measure promotes the national system of checks and balances.

The move comes days after the Morales administration <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/bolivia-president-refuses-to-recognize.php">refused to recognize</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.cne.org.bo/">National Electoral Court</a> (CNE) [official website] decision suspending the constitutional referendum, stating that the relevant letters sent by the CNE to Morales have &quot;no legal effect.&quot;  According to <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN0643844320080906">Reuters</a> [report], Morales&#39; address called for Congressional approval to ensure the CNE &quot;&#39;has no pretexts&#39;&quot; to annul the referendum, currently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-sets-date-for.php">set by Morales for December 7</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.derechoteca.com/gacetabolivia/decreto-supremo-29691-del-28-agosto-2008.htm">decree text</a>].  From La Paz, <em>La Razon</em> has <a href="http://www.la-razon.com/versiones/20080907_006388/nota_249_666204.htm">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />If approved, the proposed constitutional amendments would distribute more of Bolivia&#39;s land and energy resource income to the country&#39;s indigenous population. In May, the Bolivian National Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/bolivia-congress-approves-confidence.php">approved a referendum</a> on Morales&#39; own leadership, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">personally proposed</a> [JURIST reports] by the president last December in a bid to legitimize his campaign for the constitutional changes.  The results of that August vote permitted Morales to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">retain his office</a>; several of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-autonomy-referendum-approved-by.php">provincial governors also confirmed</a> by that referendum <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-constitution-reforms-called.php">oppose the constitutional reforms</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three judges ousted from the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Pakistani Supreme Court</a> [official website] by <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">former President Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] took new oaths on Friday. Justices Mian Shakirullah Jan, Tassaduq Hussain Jillani and Syed Jamshed Ali <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51702&Itemid=1">rejoined the court</a> [APP report] with seniority retroactive to their <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ousted-pakistan-judges-involuntarily.php">removal</a> [JURIST report] in November. Speaking after the swearing-in ceremony, Law Minister Farooq Naek again <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-law-minister-rules-out.php">ruled out</a> [JURIST report] the reinstatement of former chief justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Naek said that although Chaudhry could take a new oath, naming him chief justice would require removing <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk//profile-hcj.htm">Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=dogar">news archive</a>], which would <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/8EFE41C0C8B78088652574BB00522634?OpenDocument">create a constitutional crisis</a> [Press Trust of India report]. Also on Friday, the chief justice and two other judges on the <a href="http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/">Peshawar High Court</a> [official website]  were <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/05-Sep-2008/PHC-deposed-CJ-reappointment--blow-to-lawyers">returned to office</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> report]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iWe152N60O8rfHfthVTBaXBeBs3wD930LMJG0">more</a>. <br /><br />The fresh appointments followed <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawyers-protest-leads-to.php">clashes between lawyers and police</a> [JURIST report] during a demonstration Thursday in Islamabad. The Pakistani <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2008statements/1403/">lawyers&#39; movement</a> [AHRC backgrounder; PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec07/pakistan_11-06.html">report</a>] has recently renewed its protests to demand the reinstatement of all dismissed judges. Critics describe the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-authorities-reinstate-4-more.php">recent appointments</a> [JURIST report] of some judges as evidence of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to undermine support for total reinstatement. The judges&#39; dismissals contributed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">Musharraf&#39;s resignation</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">collapse of the coalition government</a> [JURIST report] last month. Musharraf&#39;s successor will be chosen in an election Saturday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesman for Polish <a href="http://www.kprm.gov.pl/english/s.php?bio=576">Prime Minister Donald Tusk</a> [official profile] announced Friday that the Polish government is <a href="http://wyborcza.pl/1,86871,5651028,Gov_t_Triggers_Official_Inquiry_into_Alleged_CIA_Prisons.html">investigating</a> [<em>Gazeta Wyborcza</em> report] claims that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) [official website] operated a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prison">secret prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in Poland. The prison was reportedly part of the CIA&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program, under which terrorism suspects were seized and flown to secret locations outside the US for interrogation and imprisonment. Prosecutors have reportedly obtained a <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3621313,00.html">memo</a> [Deutsche Welle report] written by Polish intelligence officials in either 2005 or 2006 that confirms the prison&#39;s existence. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL557283920080905?sp=true">more</a>. <br /><br />Poland and Romania have been accused of hosting secret prisons for the extraordinary rendition program. Allegations against the two countries came in a June 2007 <a href="http://www.assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc07/EDOC11302.htm">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/cia-operated-secret-prisons-in-poland.php">report</a>]  to the <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] by Swiss Senator <a href="http://www.dickmarty.ch/">Dick Marty</a> [personal website, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dick+marty">news archive</a>]. The report concluded that numerous European governments had cooperated with the CIA program. In February 2007, the European Parliament <A src="/paperchase/2007/02/eu-parliament-condemns-member-states.php">condemned more than a dozen European states</A> [JURIST report] for their roles in the program. Several nations have been accused of obstructing European probes into the secret prison allegations, including <A src="/paperchase/2006/11/europe-lawmaker-accuses-poland-of.php">Poland</A> [JURIST report], which allegedly housed the <A src="/paperchase/2005/12/poland-had-main-cia-prison-in-europe.php">largest CIA detention facility in Europe</A> [JURIST report]. President Bush <A src="/paperchase/2006/09/bush-confirms-existence-of-secret-cia.php">acknowledged the existence of the secret facilities</A> [JURIST report] in September 2006 but provided no details on their location or operation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The military judge presiding over the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] trial of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday barred US Air Force <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile] from acting as a legal advisor to the commission in Khadr&#39;s trial. In addition to his position as legal advisor to the Department of Defense authority in charge of the commissions, Hartmann is also the supervisor of the Office of Military Commissions-Prosecution (OMC-P). The <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/09/04/17/khadr-disqualify.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] by Colonel Patrick Parrish, the judge in Khadr&#39;s commission trial, grants a motion by Khadr&#39;s defense lawyers to exclude Hartmann from the commission because his &quot;extremely active approach&quot; to his role as supervisor of the OMC-P &quot;raises an issue about his ability to remain neutral and impartial during his post trial duties&quot; as legal advisor to the Convening Authority. Parrish&#39;s ruling also denied a motion brought by Khadr&#39;s defense lawyers to dismiss the charges in the case. The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/672453.html">more</a>. The Canadian Press has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/09/05/khadr.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Hartmann has previously been accused of bias towards prosecutors. At a Wednesday hearing, US Army <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/leadership/zanettibio.html">Gen. Gregory Zanetti</a> [official profile], deputy commander at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/military-commissions-advisor-too.php">testified</a>   [JURIST report] that Hartmann routinely bullied his counterparts and was inappropriately aggressive in seeking indictments against detainees.  In May, lawyers for detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid">news archive</a>] unsuccessfully moved to have charges against their client dropped because of <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-defense-lawyers.php">similar allegations</a> [JURIST report] against Hartmann.  Earlier that month, Hartman was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/top-pentagon-legal-adviser-disqualified.php">disqualified</a> [JURIST report] from participating in the military commission trial of detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>], but he has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/legal-advisor-staying-after-guantanamo.php">refused to resign</a> [JURIST report] from his post.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/PortalSCJN/">Mexican Supreme Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/PortalSCJN/MediosPub/Noticias/2008/Noticia20080904.htm">ruled</a> [press release, in Spanish] that <a href="http://www.walmartmexico.com.mx/">Wal-Mart de Mexico</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wal-mart">news archive</a>] may not pay employees in part with vouchers redeemable only at its stores. The court nullified the employment contract of a worker who challenged the voucher payments, finding that they violated Article 123 of the <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/1.pdf">Mexican Constitution</a> [PDF text], which guarantees the right to &quot;dignified and socially useful work.&quot; The court likened the arrangement, which Wal-Mart called the Plan of Social Welfare, to a practice that prevailed during the dictatorship of <a href="http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&artid=336">Porfirio Diaz</a> [profile], who ruled <a href="/countries/mexico.php">Mexico</a> [JURIST news archive] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Until the practice was abolished by the current constitution in 1917, workers could be forced to buy exorbitantly priced goods at company stores. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ikn6dq4i2OHrg61k8FzX3s98LyRQ">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSN0546591320080905">additional coverage</a>. From Mexico City, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span> has <a href="http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/535941.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Among other legal setbacks for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wal-mart">Wal-Mart</a> [JURIST news archive], four labor groups <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/labor-groups-file-election-law.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the Federal Election Commission last month, alleging that the retailer forced employees to attend meetings where political campaigns were discussed. Last year, a Philadelphia judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/wal-mart-ordered-to-pay-attorney-fees.php">ordered Wal-Mart</a> [JURIST report] to pay nearly $47 million in legal fees and costs resulting from a class action brought by employees who had been denied pay for work they did during breaks. A jury <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/wal-mart-ordered-to-pay-78-million-for.php">awarded the same plaintiffs $78 million</a> for their off-the-clock labor, plus <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/wal-mart-ordered-to-pay-additional-62m.php">$62 million in damages</a> [JURIST reports] under a Pennsylvania law that prohibits employers from withholding pay for more than 30 days. Also last year, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/ninth-circuit-upholds-class.php">upheld the certification</a> [JURIST report] of a class alleging that Wal-Mart had discriminated against female employees.

WCD Joint Secretary Kiran Chadha <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Govt_to_review_anti-dowry_law/articleshow/3441846.cms">said</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Times of India</font> report]: <blockquote>We will be meeting a panel of lawyers and legal experts to review the law. We have been receiving so many complaints against the two laws &#8212; section 498A (harassment for dowry) and the domestic violence act.</blockquote> Section 498A of the <a href="http://india.gov.in/outerwin.htm?id=http://chddistrictcourts.gov.in/THE%20INDIAN%20PENAL%20CODE.pdf">Indian Penal Code</a> [large PDF] provides in relevant part:<br /><blockquote>Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.</blockquote> Despite legislation controlling the cultural and religious practice, India&#39;s dowry system continues illegally, leaving many women subject to abuse without enforcement of legal protections from so-called &quot;<a href="http://www.articlesbase.com/national,-state,-local-articles/dowry-death-538040.html">dowry deaths</a>&quot; [backgrounder].  The <a href="http://www.csrindia.org/">Centre for Social Research</a> (CSR) [advocacy website], an Indian women&#39;s advocacy group, announced on Wednesday that <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/more-than-dowry-property-laws-make-girl-child-unwanted-study_10092182.html">results of its recent study</a> [IANS report] indicate that it is inheritance and property laws, and not the dowry custom, which is the primary cause of female infanticide in India.   <br /><br />In March, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Customary_payments_and_gifts_not_dowry_says_SC/articleshow/2747113.cms">concluded</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Times of India</font> report] in a controversial decision that demand for money and presents from parents of a married girl at ceremonial times should not be categorized as &#39;dowry&#39; under the penal code. The court held that although the 1961 <a href="http://india.gov.in/outerwin.htm?id=http://wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> [text] defines &#39;dowry&#39; as money or presents given before, during, or after the marriage ceremony, payments given at other ceremonial times such as the birth of a child should not be included in the definition.  The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] has also <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/pakistan-high-court-upholds-ban-on.php">deplored the dowry custom</a> [JURIST report] as a &#39;social evil.&#39;

Staff Sgt. Hal M.

Warner was originally scheduled to appear for an <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/html/NLSOGlakesArticle_32_investigations.htm">Article 32 preliminary hearing</a> [JAG backgrounder] on August 15, but the hearing was <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21850&Itemid=128">postponed</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hearing-postponed-for-us-soldier.php">report</a>] until September 5. 1st Lt. Michael C. Behenna, is also charged with premeditated murder, assault, making a false official statement and obstruction of justice in connection with Mohamed&#39;s death.<br /><br />In March, US Marine Sgt. Ryan Weemer was <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Rel-08-001-080318.htm">charged</a> [press release] with one count of murder and one count of dereliction of duty for his involvement in the shooting death of a detained Iraqi insurgent during a <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/">Multi-National Force-Iraq</a> (MNF-Iraq) [official website] <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oif-phantom-fury-fallujah.htm">November 2004 offensive</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Investigation-Timeline.htm">Fallujah</a> [USMC timeline; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Fallujah">news archive</a>]. The charges against Weemer followed <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-marine-sergeant-re-charged-with.php">December 2007 charges</a> against Marine Sgt. Jermaine A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] San Francisco <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp">Mayor Gavin Newsom</a> [official website] has postponed implementation of a <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/countyclerk_index.asp?id=78261">program</a> [city backgrounder] to issue <a href="/currentawareness/idcards.php">identification cards</a> [JURIST news archive] giving city residents access to government services without regard to immigration status. A mayoral spokesman said Thursday that the delay is necessary to ensure that the program does not violate state or federal law. An <a href="http://library4.municode.com/4201/DocView/14131/1/349#0-0-0-5817">ordinance</a> [text] <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/14/BAB9TBP5H.DTL">approved</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> report] by the city&#39;s <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/bdsupvrs_index.asp">Board of Supervisors</a> [official website] in November authorized the city clerk to issue the cards, which could be presented to any city department or city-funded agency as as proof of identification and residency. The <a href="http://www.irli.org">Immigration Reform Law Institute</a> (IRLI) [advocacy website] has filed a <a href="http://webaccess.sftc.org/Scripts/Magic94/mgrqispi94.dll?APPNAME=IJS&PRGNAME=ROA22&ARGUMENTS=-ACPF08508341">lawsuit</a> [case materials] on behalf of several city residents challenging the program as violating the <a href="http://ceres.ca.gov/topic/env_law/ceqa/stat/">California Environmental Quality Act</a> (CEQA) [text]. In a <a href="http://www.irli.org/Petit%20for%20Writ%20FINAL.pdf">petition</a> [PDF text] seeking injunctive relief, IRLI alleged that the program would have &quot;growth-inducing impacts&quot; by encouraging illegal aliens to live in the city. IRLI claimed the program must undergo an environmental impact study, as required by CEQA, before taking effect. The city was to begin issuing the cards as soon as next month. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5cZXYiBFTVGSMfcwM0hvLu_5w0AD930FSFO0">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/04/BASI12NG90.DTL">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />The San Francisco program was modeled after a <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/connecticut-city-approves-ids-for.php">similar initiative</a> in New Haven, Connecticut, which last year <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/connecticut-city-becomes-first-in-us-to.php">became the first US city to issue IDs to illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST reports]. Another San Francisco ordinance, intended to <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/san-francisco-mayor-to-maintain-citys.php">maintain the city&#39;s status</a> [JURIST report] as a haven for <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive], has also been controversial. In July, an advocacy group <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/san-francisco-criticized-for-immigrant.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US attorney for Northern California to investigate a homicide involving an illegal immigrant who had avoided deportation under the ordinance, which prohibits city employees from reporting illegal immigrants to federal authorities.

Abortion was legalized in the country in 1985, but only in cases of rape, developmental defect of the fetus, or certification that the pregnancy posed a psychological or physical heath risk to the mother. Aido did not provide specific details on the changes sought, but said they were necessary because of discrepancies in regional governments&#39; applications of the existing law. The panel&#39;s recommendations will be incorporated into a bill expected to be brought before the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso">parliament</a> [Cortes Generales website] in the first half of 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-crm-779.html">sentenced</a> [DOJ press release] Thursday to four years in prison for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2848">Judge Ellen S. Huvelle</a> [official profile] of the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] imposed less than the maximum sentence of 12.5 years but more than the three years and three months <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/doj-seeks-lighter-sentences-for-ex.php">recommended by prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] from the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice </a> (DOJ) [official website]. Calling the case &quot;very challenging,&quot; Huvelle said she took into account Abramoff&#39;s &quot;consistent course of corrupt conduct&quot; as well as his subsequent cooperation with prosecutors. In a <a href="http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/abramoff-government-sentencing-memorandum.pdf">sentencing memorandum</a> [text, PDF], the DOJ had asked for a final sentence of 64 months, with credit for time served. <blockquote>[Such a sentence would be] appropriate given Abramoff&#8217;s extraordinary cooperation to date, cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a Member of Congress, five high-level legislative branch officials, one high-level executive branch official, and two other mid to low-level public officials as well as on-going matters. Sixty-four months also is sufficiently severe to reflect the seriousness of Abramoff&#8217;s conduct, appropriately punishing him for crimes that are egregious. </blockquote>Abramoff&#39;s lawyers <a href="Abramoff memo - http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/abramoff-memorandum.pdf">sought</a> [memorandum, PDF] a sentence no longer than 43 months, running concurrently with time Abramoff is already <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/abramoff-begins-six-year-prison.php">serving</a> [JURIST report] on other charges. Abramoff also was ordered to pay more than $23 million in restitution to clients he defrauded. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMZw4dYnLxr5AKkDn0bKGqH0epYAD93059KO1">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/washington/05abramoff.html?hp">additional coverage</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/protest/36636prs20080904.html">renewed its call</a> [press release] for an investigation into the actions of law enforcement officials at the <a href="http://www.gopconvention2008.com/">Republican National Convention</a> (RNC) [convention website] in Minnesota this week.  The ACLU alleges that officers in St. Paul conducted &quot;mass arrests, police raids on private homes and [detained] several journalists&quot; in possible violation of First and Fourth Amendment rights. ACLU Executive Director <a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/staff/13279res20030205.html">Anthony D. Romero</a> [ACLU profile] spoke out against the alleged actions, commenting that &quot;[p]olitical conventions should be a showcase for free expression, not a venue for bullying and intimidation.&quot; The <em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/conventions/27840754.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUo8cyaiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU">local coverage</a>.

Goodwin was charged with a misdemeanor while her producers were charged with felony intent to riot.  According to the ACLU, charges against Amy Goodwin and her producers should be dropped, and the felony charges against Goodwin&#39;s producers have since been suspended pending investigation.  St. Paul police have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/04/convention.protests/">denied using excessive force</a> [CNN report], saying they were doing their job to maintain the peace at the convention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian-based <a href="http://www.teckcominco.com/Generic.aspx?portalName=tc">Teck Cominco Ltd.</a> [corporate website] asked US District Court Judge John Sedwick Wednesday to approve a $120M settlement agreement with six Eskimo plaintiffs from the Alaskan village of Kivalino. The agreement stems from a 2002 lawsuit filed in the <a href="http://www.akd.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US District Court for the District of Alaska</a> [official website] by residents living near the company&#39;s Red Dog Mine, claiming the company - the world&#39;s second largest zinc producer - dumped more than the Clean Water Act&#39;s legal limit of toxic discharge into Red Dog Creek. Kivalino residents fish and draw their drinking water from the creek. The parties had initially given <a href="http://community.adn.com/sites/community.adn.com/files/settlement.pdf">notice of a settlement agreement</a> [PDF text] in May, but the plaintiffs allegedly <a href="http://www.adn.com/money/industries/mining/story/482579.html">changed their minds</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Anchorage Daily News</span> report] before filing a proposed settlement with the court. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=769429">more</a>.<br /><br />Other mining companies elsewhere around the world have in recent years faced legal challenges, complaints and protests from indigenous and aboriginal groups claiming that mining activity has infringed their rights or their enjoyment of property. In July, the Philippines <a href="http://www.chr.gov.ph/index.php">Commission on Human Rights </a> (CHR) [official website] announced it would investigate Australian mining company <a href="http://www.oceanagold.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=34&Itemid=83">Oceana Gold</a> [corporate website] for possible human rights violations at the site of a planned gold and copper mine in Didipio, Philippines. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] in Canada ruled that sentences imposed on seven aboriginal protesters in March for opposing mining company operations on community land were <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ontario-appeals-court-rules-aboriginal.php">too severe</a> [JURIST report].

Television images showed police beating the lawyers with batons outside Parliament, in a confrontation that reportedly began after an estimated 100 demonstrators tried to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aAXPHzx9lBWk&refer=home">enter the nearby Supreme Court</a> [Bloomberg News report]. Hundreds of lawyers and other protesters had gathered for a sit-in outside the buildings, where <a href="http://www.pildat.org/mna/profile.asp?detid=124">Aitzaz Ahsan</a> [profile], president of Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court Bar Association, <a href="http://dailymailnews.com/200809/05/news/dmheadlinepage01.html">told reporters</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span> report] that an independent judiciary is essential to a stable government in <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archive]. Protests also <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gLawaMriX8htClG1RfzIKeXMv9-g">took place</a> [AFP report] in the cities of Lahore, Karachi and Multan. The demonstrations came amid reports that four judges removed from the <a href="http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/">Peshawar High Court</a> [official website], including the chief justice, <a href="http://dailymailnews.com/200809/05/news/dmboxitem.html">would take new oaths Friday</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span> report].<br /><br />The Pakistani <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2008statements/1403/">lawyers&#39; movement</a> [AHRC backgrounder; PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec07/pakistan_11-06.html">report</a>] renewed its protests last week after eight judges were <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-law-minister-rules-out.php">reappointed</a> [JURIST report] to the Sindh High Court in Karachi. Critics described that development as evidence of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to undermine support for reinstatement of all the judges nationwide. Pakistan&#39;s coalition government <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] last week after former prime minister <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/profile.php">Nawaz Sharif</a> [party profile; JURIST news archive] withdrew his <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] party over the failure to reach an agreement with the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) [party website] to reinstate the judges. Musharraf, who <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] last month to avoid impeachment proceedings for firing the judges and other alleged abuses of authority, now faces the possibility of <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-rights-advocate-seeks-to.php">criminal charges</a> [JURIST report].

The SEC complaint, filed Wednesday in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], accuses Tzolov and Butler of increasing their commissions by selling <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09gret.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&ref=business&adxnnlx=1220549439-gR6fvwXms63BhJGxN4Oo1A">auction-rate securities</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> backgrounder] that they told clients were &quot;low risk, highly liquid alternatives&quot; to bank deposits and money market funds. The investments were in fact secured by subprime mortgages and other risky collateral. The former brokers are charged with violating anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000078---j000-.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/77q.html">Securities Act of 1933</a> and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=efda28908fe43c862d954d9e2c69e832&rgn=div8&view=text&node=17:3.0.1.1.1.1.57.71&idno=17">SEC regulations</a> [text]. The SEC is asking the court to order injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties and disgorgement of profits, plus interest. Butler has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSN0327107920080903">pleaded not guilty</a> [Reuters report]. Andrew M. Calamari, associate director of the SEC&#39;s New York Regional Office, <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-187.htm">said</a> [press release] that the case &quot;demonstrates how the recent turmoil in the subprime market has affected even investors who had no intention of buying subprime securities.&quot; AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jUfO3x9Ur4jKR4izUr7llsXcd-lg">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Taipei District Court on Tuesday cleared former <a href="http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/president.htm">Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">profile</a>] of defamation charges stemming from Taiwan&#39;s 1991 purchase of six frigates from France.  Six retired Taiwanese admirals filed suit against Chen following his <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1429582.php/Taiwan_ex-president_acquitted_of_libel_">2005 televised comments</a> [DPA report] suggesting that the group received $20 million in improper kickbacks from the deal.  The court <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2360213.htm?tab=latest">held</a> [Radio Australia report] that Chen&#39;s comments did not constitute slander because the matter was appropriate for public scrutiny.  Following the verdict, one of the five living plaintiffs said the the group will appeal the decision.  AFP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/01/30/t1_88.php">more</a>.   <br /><br />The frigate sale launched a major corruption investigation in France into the so-called <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4965734.stm">Clearstream scandal</a> [BBC timeline], implicating then-Interior Minister and current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">French President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nicolas+sarkozy">news archive</a>] in the kickback scheme.  The accusations against Sarkozy resulted in <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-france-pm-charged-in-sarkozy.php">defamation charges</a> [JURIST report] in France, and last month French prosecutors requested the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL625816220080806">closure of the corruption investigation for lack of evidence</a> [Reuters report].  A Taiwanese investigation resulted in <a href="http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/104/article_1218.asp">prison terms for nearly 30 officers and arms dealers</a> [RFI report].  Chen remains under investigation for unrelated corruption and embezzlement charges, following high-profile indictments of his family and colleagues.  Last year, a high court affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/taiwan-presidents-son-in-law-sentenced.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Chen&#39;s son-in-law on insider trading charges. Chen&#39;s wife, Wu Shu-chen, was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/taiwan-first-lady-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 for embezzlement and falsifying documents. Chen continues to <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j26WayA5efqc1KhXAsf0YSADw26w">maintain his innocence</a> [AFP report] on all charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Moscow Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] filed a motion Monday to ban the US animated series <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/">South Park</a></span> [entertainment website], alleging it violates children&#39;s rights under international law. In a <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/news/news-8382/">press release</a> [text, in Russian], the office said it was taking &quot;measures to remove violations and prevent abuse of freedom of mass media&quot; by <a href="http://2x2tv.ru/">Telekanal 2x2</a> [media website, in Russian], which broadcasts <span style="font-style:italic;">South Park</span> and other US shows in Moscow and St. Petersburg. According to the press release, a study commissioned by prosecutors found that &quot;information products of low moral and ethical content have had a devastating impact on children, distorts their values, and poses the risk of panic states and neurotic disorders.&quot; The press release continued: <blockquote>The broadcast violates the prohibition on abuse of freedom of mass media, in particular, on the distribution of media materials that promote pornography, violence and cruelty. Broadcasting cartoons in the time available for children contradicts the universally recognized principles and norms of international law aimed at protecting the rights and legitimate interests of children, protecting them from information and material harmful to their welfare, health, and moral and spiritual development. </blockquote> Telekanal 2x2 responded to the charges in a <a href="http://2x2tv.ru/blog/post/47">blog posting</a> [text, in Russian] on its website, saying it &quot;does not agree with the claims and intends to resolve the issues in court.&quot; Last week, the Russian Union of Christians of Evangelical Faith <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080904/116551837.html">asked prosecutors to investigate Telekanal 2x2</a> [RIA Novosti report]. The group&#39;s leader said the program insults religion and incites hatred. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL869731820080908">more</a>. RIA Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080908/116622635.html">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />Earlier this year, Russian religious leaders asked the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office to revoke Telekanal 2x2&#39;s license for allegedly promoting immorality and violence. The <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/">Russian Federal Surveillance Service for Mass Communications, Communications and Cultural Heritage Protection</a> (Rossvyazokhrankultura) [official website] warned Telekanal 2x2 about its broadcast of other programs and recommended that they be taken off the air. <a href="/countries/russia.php">Russia</a> [JURIST news archive] has moved to restrict freedom of expression in recent years as a means  of fighting &quot;extremism.&quot; A 2006 law <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/putin-signs-russian-extremism-law.php">signed by then-President Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST report] criminalizes the public defending of terrorism, &quot;humiliating national merit,&quot; and publicly slandering government officials. Last year, a lead prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/russian-prosecutor-urges-censoring.php">suggested censoring the Internet</a> [JURIST report] to combat extremism. This year, however, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-president-opposes-media-libel.php">encouraged the Russian parliament to reject a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would allow officials to close media outlets suspected of spreading libel or slander.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-60732-CR0.wpd.pdf">vacated the conviction</a> [opinion, PDF] of former <a href="http://www.kkk.bz/">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) [WARNING: readers may find this website offensive; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=KKK+OR+klan">news archive</a>] member James Ford Seale for his involvement in the 1964 deaths of two 19-year-old black teens.  Seale was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/alleged-kkk-member-gets-3-life.php">sentenced</a> to three life terms in August 2007, two months after his <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/ex-kkk-member-convicted-of-1964-civil.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] in Mississippi federal court on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00001201----000-.html">two counts of kidnapping resulting in death and one count of conspiracy</a> [18 U.S.C. 1201(a) and (c) text].  On appeal, the Fifth Circuit considered only whether a <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3282.html">five-year statute of limitations for non-capital crimes</a> [18 U.S.C. 3282 text] enacted in 1972 could retroactively apply to bar Seale&#39;s 2007 indictment for the 1964 killings.  Endorsing the view that &quot;statutory changes that are procedural or remedial in nature apply retroactively,&quot; the court held: <blockquote>The district court erred by failing to recognize the presumption that changes affecting statutes of limitation apply retroactively, even without explicit direction from Congress. While we are mindful of the seriousness of the crimes at issue, we cannot abdicate our duty to faithfully apply a valid limitations period.</blockquote>  The 71-year-old Seale has been in federal prison since his 2007 conviction.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hqFW1zeW24qyWxTKbannAbuhWCrAD933K3UO2">more</a>.  <br /><br />In 1964, Seale had been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping Henry Dee and Charles Moore, who were later found dead in the Mississippi River, but was released due to insufficient evidence. Federal prosecutors revived the case years later by relying on the testimony of Charles Marcus Edwards, a former fellow KKK member who received immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. The case was one of several recently <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050621/21killen.htm">re-opened civil rights-era cases</a> [US News backgrounder] following the 2005 conviction of <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-killen-gets-60-years.php">Edgar Ray Killen</a> [JURIST report] for the 1964 deaths of three civil rights activists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072431p.pdf">reinstated</a> [opinion, PDF] a class-action lawsuit Tuesday against drug maker <a href="http://www.merck.com/">Merck &amp; Co.</a> [corporate website] over claims relating to its prescription painkiller <a href="/currentawareness/vioxx.php">Vioxx</a> [JURIST news archive]. The lawsuit had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/federal-judge-dismisses-vioxx.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court of New Jersey in April 2007. In its ruling, the three-judge panel held by a 2-1 margin concluded that &quot;the District Court acted prematurely in finding as a matter of law that Appellants were on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud before October 9, 2001.&quot; The panel reversed the dismissal, and remanded the case to the District Court. Merck indicated in a <a href="http://www.merck.com/newsroom/press_releases/corporate/2008_0909.html">press release</a> [text] that it is weighing whether to appeal the decision to the Third Circuit <em>en banc</em> or appeal directly to the Supreme Court.  The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122097536443615081.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2007, US District Court Judge Stanley Chester determined that the two-year limitations period on the action started to run in September 2001 with the release of a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/archive/g1751d.htm">warning letter</a> [text] from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> [official website], coupled with subsequent attention from financial analysts and members of the press. The first fraud complaint against the company was filed in November of 2003. Merck pulled Vioxx from the market in September 2004 after a study showed that it could double the risk of heart attack or stroke if taken for more than 18 months. The price of Merck stock jumped by almost 10% following news of the class action dismissal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/crd0908/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/08/mena19777.htm">press release</a>] Wednesday calling on Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, and Yemen to join in a global moratorium on the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] for juveniles.  The report states that the five countries are the last in the world known to engage in the practice, with a combined 32 executions of juvenile offenders since 2005.  HRW said that Saudia Arabia and Iran, which alone has carried out 26 of those 32 juvenile executions, have not implemented legislation prohibiting the practice, while Sudan, Pakistan, and Yemen do not enforce their national bans.  Noting that over 100 juvenile offenders are currently on death row or awaiting final verdicts within the five named countries, HRW recommended that <blockquote>Governments in states that have yet to prohibit the juvenile death penalty for all crimes should<br />   1. Enact as a matter of urgency legislation banning the imposition of capital punishment or life without parole on persons who were under 18 at the time of the crime, without exceptions;<br />   2. Immediately implement a moratorium on all executions of persons convicted of crimes committed before age 18, pending passage of legislation banning the juvenile death penalty;<br />   3. Review all existing death sentences passed on persons who were under 18 at the time of the crime, and immediately commute those sentences to custodial or other sentences in conformity with international juvenile justice standards.</blockquote>  For countries that already have a juvenile execution ban in place, the report emphasized the need for judicial understanding and enforcement of the ban and called for child defendants to have access to legal assistance.  HRW also urged the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">United Nations General Assembly</a> [official website], meeting in New York next week, to expand their December 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/un-general-assembly-passes-death.php">call for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] to include a report on compliance with the juvenile death penalty ban.  AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ioRdI-psxp4NloNlF9zj1zEYc6Dw">more</a>.<br /><br />In June 2007, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/hrw-calls-for-end-to-juvenile.php">called for Iran to stop using the death penalty for juveniles</a> [JURIST report; HRW <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">press release</a>] convicted of serious crimes. HRW said that Iran has executed offenders who committed crimes when they were as young as 15.  Wednesday&#39;s report said that Iranian judges can impose the death penalty in capital cases with defendants as young as nine years old for girls and 15 years old for boys.  All five countries named by HRW are parties to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, and Iran, Sudan, and Yemen are parties to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [texts].  According to HRW, both treaties &quot;prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18.&quot;  After years of criticism from HRW and other rights groups, the United States Supreme Court <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/01/usdom10231.htm">formally abolished</a> [HRW report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-supreme-court-strikes.php">report</a>] executions for crimes committed by juveniles in 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0341p-06.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court&#39;s grant of summary judgment and dismissal to Michigan&#39;s <a href="http://region7aaa.org/">Region VII Area Agency on Aging</a> (Region VII) [official website], instead ruling that an unlawful termination suit filed by former employee Denise Hughes can continue. Hughes argues that the agency fired her because of statements she made to a local newspaper regarding sexual harassment allegations made against the agency&#39;s executive director, in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/first_amendment.html">First Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder]. Region VII had argued that, because it was not a government entity, it was immune from the suit brought under a <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">statute targeting government action</a> [42 U.S.C. &sect;1983 text], and that Hughes&#39; statements were not protected because they were not regarding issues of &quot;public concern.&quot;  The Sixth Circuit rejected those arguments, holding that even though the agency was a private non-profit, because of &quot;pervasive entwinement of governmental entities and representatives in the supervision and management of Region VII&quot; the agency was effectively acting as an arm of government and could be sued under the statute. The court also found that Hughes&#39; statements to the reporter were protected because of the public interest in the governance of the agency:<blockquote>The evidence in this case shows that a newspaper reporter specifically sought out Hughes as a source regarding allegations of sexual harassment against the executive director of Region VII, an area agency on aging that is responsible for distributing a substantial amount of funds entrusted to the agency by the State of Michigan and the federal government.  Further, the reporter testified in his deposition that, while Hughes was still an employee of Region VII, the reporter confirmed to King, the executive director, that Hughes was serving as a source for the reporter&#8217;s critical articles regarding Region VII.  In light of this evidence and the case law, we conclude that Hughes, in speaking to a reporter about allegations of sexual harassment against a public official, engaged in a constitutionally protected activity.</blockquote>The Sixth Circuit went on to find that Hughes&#39; statements were not made in connection with her official duties and were thus eligible for protection under the public concern exception.<br /><br />In May 2006, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-473.ZO.html">held</a> [majority opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/supreme-court-limits-first-amendment.php">report</a>] that First Amendment protections do not extend to government employees for comments made while performing their official duties, even when the employee is acting to expose alleged government wrongdoing. In that case, an employee in the Los Angeles District Attorney&#39;s office argued that the content of a memorandum, in which he alleged that a&nbsp;sheriff had lied in a search warrant affidavit, should be protected because the issue was a matter of public concern, but the court disagreed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ctd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for Connecticut</a> [official website] has blocked enforcement of a new <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_00000526----000-.html">provision</a> [text] of the US Bankruptcy Code against attorneys seeking to advise clients about taking on additional debt. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2725">District Judge Christopher Droney</a> [official profile] issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday, ruling that the statute was so broad as to unconstitutionally restrict attorneys&#39; First Amendment rights. The provision prohibits debt-relief agencies from advising clients &quot;to incur more debt in contemplation of ... filing a case&quot; under the Bankruptcy Code. AP <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jIE8S2f2kjAKC2Y7fRqsDZ-ZRSmQD933GPL80">quoted</a> Droney as writing,<blockquote>If the government seeks to prevent manipulation of the bankruptcy system, a more narrowly tailored approach would be to penalize those who take on certain types of debts.</blockquote> The lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/lawyers-group-files-suit-against-new.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 by the <a href="http://nacba.com/">National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys</a> (NACBA) and the <a href="http://www.ctbar.org/">Connecticut Bar Association</a> [professional association websites]. <br /><br />Droney&#39;s ruling follows a similar <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/09/072405P.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; Reuters <a href="Reuters report re 8th Cir - http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN0547717420080905">report</a>] handed down Thursday by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22eighth+circuit%22">news archive</a>]. Ruling that attorneys are &quot;debt relief agencies&quot; as defined by the Bankruptcy Code, the St. Louis-based court held that the challenged provision was not sufficiently tailored because it could restrict legal advice regarding debt that &quot;may not be abusive or harmful to creditors.&quot; The provision was part of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ008.109">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005</a> [text], which made filing for bankruptcy more difficult by requiring credit counseling and mandating above-average earners to file under the restrictive <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sup_01_11_10_13.html">Chapter 13</a> [text]. The NACBA has <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/lawyers-group-slams-new-federal.php">criticized the new law</a> [JURIST report] as doing little to stop abuses of the bankruptcy system and placing unnecessary hurdles in front of people with legitimate reasons to file for bankruptcy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22eighth+circuit%22">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/09/073062P.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] claims that federal and state <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">drug laws</a> [relevant statutes] violate the constitutional and statutory rights of a priest in the <a href="http://www.ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/">Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</a> (EZCC) [official website], which embraces the sacramental use of marijuana. The St. Louis-based court affirmed a decision by the US <a href="http://www.iasd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Southern District of Iowa</a> [official website], which ruled that plaintiff <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/">Carl E. Olsen</a> [personal website] did not state a claim under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00002000--bb000-.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) or the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/housing_rluipa2.htm">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [texts]. Olsen sought a declaratory judgment that marijuana is not a controlled substance when used for religious purposes and an injunction prohibiting government officials from enforcing the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">US</a> and <a href="http://www.state.ia.us/ibpe/pdf/IC124A.pdf">Iowa anti-drug statutes</a> [text] against him. The Eighth Circuit ruled that RFRA does not apply to state or local governments and that Olsen had already unsuccessfully litigated the RFRA issue as to the federal government. Noting that &quot;there has not been a change in controlling law&quot; since the prior cases, the court likewise held that Olsen had already litigated his free exercise and equal protection claims, and that he was not within the class protected by RLUIPA.<br /><br />Olsen previously challenged drug laws in the <a href="http://www.ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/Cases/Rush.aspx">First Circuit</a> and the <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/RASTAFARI/ginsburg.html">District of Columbia Circuit</a>, among other <a href="http://www.ethiopianzioncopticchurch.org/Cases/Default.aspx">jurisdictions</a> [case materials]. Proponents of marijuana use for medical rather than spiritual purposes won a legal victory this July, when a California court <a href="http://http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state&#39;s medical marijuana program does not unconstitutionally interfere with federal drug laws. Last year, New Mexico joined about a dozen states that <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/new-mexico-governor-signs-medical.php">permit medical marijuana</a> [JURIST report] when Governor Bill Richardson signed a bill legalizing the drug for the treatment of &quot;eligible conditions and symptoms.&quot; The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/ninth-circuit-rules-drug-laws-can-be.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that federal drug laws could be enforced against a terminally ill patient using marijuana with a doctor&#39;s recommendation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of the Netherlands on Tuesday detailed its plans to ban the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa+OR+burka"><span style="font-style:italic;">burqa</span></a> [JURIST news archive] in and around all primary schools, including Muslim institutions. In a letter to <a href="http://www.parlement.nl/">parliament</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.government.nl/Government/Balkenende_IV_Government/Ronald_Plasterk">Education Minister Ronald Plasterk</a> [official website] predicted that a bill to prohibit the head-to-foot garment would be presented to lawmakers next year and could be enacted by 2010. He noted that the legislation would not extend to high schools or universities, which could decide on their own whether to ban the burqa, also known as a <span style="font-style:italic;">niqab</span>, and the measure would not apply to the Muslim <span style="font-style:italic;">hijab</span>, or headscarf. Plasterk said the ban on burqas would promote security and foster teacher-student communication. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/2711729/Dutch-to-ban-burkas-when-picking-children-up-from-school.html">more</a>. NIS News has <a href="http://www.nisnews.nl/public/100908_1.htm">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Dutch officials in January <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/netherlands-to-ban-burqas-in-schools.php">announced plans</a> to ban burqas in schools and government offices, rejecting an alternative <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/dutch-mp-seeks-to-criminalize-burqa.php">proposal</a> [JURIST reports] to prohibit wearing them anywhere in public. In 2006, then-Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/dutch-government-promises-burqa-ban.php">prohibit the public wearing of face coverings</a> [JURIST report] to ensure security and promote the integration of Dutch society. The proposal was met by <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/protestors-oppose-planned-netherlands.php">protests</a> and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/new-dutch-integration-minister-rejects.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST reports] by Verdonk&#39;s successor following national elections. It is estimated that only 100 women among the Netherlands&#39; 1 million Muslims wear the burqa. Elsewhere in Europe, France has <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/french-headscarf-ban-will-take-effect.htm">banned religious clothing and symbols in public schools</a> [JURIST report].  A German court has <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-state-court-upholds-teacher.php">upheld a similar ban</a>, and the Danish government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/denmark-government-to-propose-headscarf.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST reports] in May to prohibit judges from wearing religious headscarves.

The report explores single entity violations of Section 2 of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/foia/divisionmanual/ch2.htm#a1">Sherman Act</a> [text], in which a competitor seeks or maintains monopoly power which harms consumers. <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-at-787.html">Commenting</a> [press release] on the purpose of the report, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/barnettbio.htm">Assistant Attorney General Thomas O.

Kovacic</a> [official profile], issued his own <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/commissioners/kovacic/index.shtml">statement</a> [PDF text] separate from that of his colleagues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukrainian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website] said Monday that she <a href="http://unian.net/eng/news/news-271642.html">has been summoned</a> [UNIAN report] to testify before Ukraine&#39;s Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office on September 11.

As a result of conflicts between Yushchenko and Tymoshemko, the country&#39;s ruling coalition <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/49d41258-7a19-11dd-bb93-000077b07658.html">collapsed last week</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</font> report] and must be reconstituted within 40 days, or will be dissolved in order for new elections to be held.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22fifth+circuit%22">news archive</a>] on Monday revived the possibility of several state-law claims against individuals and entities connected to <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron Corp.</a> [JURIST news archive] by <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/07/07-20043-CV0.wpd.pdf ">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] that Texas courts may decide whether the period allotted for bringing such claims has lapsed. The court, based in New Orleans, reversed in part a ruling by the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] that all the claims were time-barred. Invoking a <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html">statute</a> [text] which allows federal courts to &quot;enjoin[] repeatedly vexatious litigants from filing future state court actions,&quot; the district court in 2002 ordered Houston law firm <a href="http://www.fleming-law.com/">Fleming &amp; Associates</a> [firm website] to seek court permission before filing any additional Enron lawsuits. In 2005, the court denied the firm&#39;s motion to file 34 lawsuits on behalf of about 1,200 clients alleging state law claims. The court reasoned that allowing the suits to be filed would be futile because they were time-barred under Texas law. The firm appealed, arguing that the claims fell within the limitations period because they &quot;related back&quot; to the date of the firm&#39;s motion. In the Fifth Circuit opinion, <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1928">Circuit Judge Charles Prado</a> [official profile] wrote for the three-judge panel: <blockquote>The district court was incorrect ... in denying the motion for leave to file suit for the claims that have a four-year statute of limitations. The court did not cite any authority for using its own local rules to dictate the state&#39;s filing date for purposes of Texas&#39;s relation-back principle. ... Thus, the district court should have allowed the Texas state courts to decide whether the filing of the state petitions relates back to the filing of the motion for leave to file suit (for the claims that have a four-year statute of limitations), meaning that these claims might not be futile. Because the Fleming Firm sought to file these claims before the statute of limitations expired, it is up to the state court to determine how to proceed.</blockquote> The Fifth Circuit held that the district court correctly denied the firm leave to file claims with limitations periods shorter than four years. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122093085422213803.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">more</a>. Reuters has additional <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSBNG27772620080909">coverage</a>. <br /><br />Also on Monday, US <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=980">District Judge Melinda Harmon</a> [official profile] in Houston ruled that plaintiffs in another Enron lawsuit were entitled to nearly $700 million in legal fees - the largest such award in a securities case. This July, experts <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/enron-officers-may-be-eligible-for-new.php">predicted</a> [JURIST report] that former Enron executives convicted on charges related to the 2001 accounting scandal may be eligible for new trials, depending on the outcome of an appeal by former CEO Jeffrey Skilling. Retrials for three former Enron Broadband Services executives are <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-enron-executives-scheduled-for.php">scheduled to begin in November</a> [JURIST report] following the Fifth Circuit&#39;s refusal to dismiss charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French politicians are criticizing a court&#39;s decision to postpone a Muslim suspect&#39;s trial on armed-robbery charges during the holy month of <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/features/ramadan_chart.html">Ramadan</a> [Beliefnet.com backgrounder], arguing that it violates France&#39;s constitutional separation of church and state. The Court of Assizes at Ille-et-Vilaine on Friday rescheduled the trial &quot;in the interest of a proper administration of justice&quot; after a defense attorney requested the delay because his client would not be fully capable of defending himself after having fasted for 14 days. The attorney general of the <a href="http://www.carte-judiciaire.justice.gouv.fr/index.php?rubrique=10541&ssrubrique=10617">Court of Appeal</a> [official website, in French] at Rennes, where the trial is to take place, said the court&#39;s decision was based on several factors and added that the judiciary would not &quot;stop judging people of Muslim faith who follow the Ramadan.&quot; In an <a href="http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/350359.FR.php">interview</a> [text, in French] with the newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Liberation</span>, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/hero2004/amura.html">Urban Affairs Minister Fadela Amara</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Time</span> profile], a Muslim herself, called the postponement a &quot;knife wound&quot; to secularism. Right-wing leader <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=jean-marie+le+pen">Jean-Marie le Pen</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1943193.stm">profile</a>] also denounced the decision. The trial is now scheduled for January 19. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7602540.stm">more</a>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> has <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/2008/09/05/un-proces-reporte-pour-cause-de-ramadan_1092102_0.html">local coverage</a>, in French.<br /><br />Article I of the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/constitution.asp">French Constitution</a> [text, in French] &quot;ensures equality before the law for all citizens without regard to origin, race or religion.&quot; Since 2004, <a href="/countries/france.php">France</a> [JURIST news archive] has <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/french-headscarf-ban-will-take-effect.htm">banned religious clothing and symbols in public schools</a> [JURIST report] as a measure to protect separation of church and state. Muslim women have opposed the law as discriminatory because it prohibits them from wearing headscarves. A German court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-state-court-upholds-teacher.php">upheld a similar ban</a> in March, and the Danish government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/denmark-government-to-propose-headscarf.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST reports] in May to prohibit judges from wearing religious headscarves. In Turkey, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) last month <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/turkish-ruling-party-drops-opposition.php">dropped its opposition</a> to a prohibition on wearing headscarves at public universities after the Turkish Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/amendments-easing-headscarf-ban-struck.php">struck down a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST reports] seeking to relax the ban.

Nair is on trial for <a href="http://">accusing a judge of &quot;prostituting herself&quot;</a> [blog entry] in a defamation case brought by <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/AboutUs/Org-MP-MP-Prof-LeeKuanYew.htm">former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew</a> [official profile] against the Singapore Democratic Party. Under a provision of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1872-REVED-224&doctitle=PENAL%20CODE%0a&date=latest&method=part&sl=1&segid=888373001-001303#888373002-001588">Singaporean Penal Code</a> [text], insulting a public servant conducting a judicial proceeding is punishable by up to one year in prison, a $5,000 fine or both. After Nair entered his plea, the trial was adjourned until later this week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A report [B&#39;Tselem <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20080911.asp">press release</a>] released Thursday by <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp">B&#39;Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories</a> [advocacy website] alleges that Israeli security policies have resulted in Palestinians being prevented from accessing land adjacent to settlements in the West Bank. The report, entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.btselem.org/Download/200809_Access_Denied_introduction_and_Conclusions.pdf">Access Denied: Israeli measures to deny Palestinians access to land around settlements</a>&quot; [report summary, PDF]  describes two main Israeli behaviors against Palestinians in the West Bank, including the use of violence and harassment by settlers and security forces to keep Palestinians away from the settlements, and the building of a secondary fence to create a buffer zone consisting of empty land in a wide swath around the settlements. B&#39;Tselem explained the extent of the report:<blockquote>[T]he blocking of access surveyed in this report is not to be viewed in isolation, but as part of a body of prohibitions, restrictions, oppressive means, and theft of land imposed on Palestinians in the West Bank, who are under army occupation. Along with this, the closing of land around settlements and blocking of Palestinian access to the land are not minor phenomena, and the resultant harm to Palestinians is great, in particular with respect to farmland, on which many families depend for their livelihood. ... Throughout the report are descriptions how settlers and the defense establishment block Palestinian access to land around settlements. In many cases, the closing is piratical: the authorities know of it but turn a blind eye, or wink, and systematically fail to enforce the law. Such unauthorized closing of land &#8211; carried out by settlers, and sometimes also soldiers, in part by placing physical barriers and by violent means &#8211; has been going on for more than three decades.</blockquote> The <em>Jersualem Post</em> has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1221034883773&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSLA34339220080911?sp=true">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, the Israeli rights group <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en&id=">Yesh Din</a> [advocacy website] highlighted the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/israel-police-unresponsive-to-violence.php">lack of investigations and prosecutions</a> [JURIST report] of Israeli settlers who commit crimes against Palestinians. Israel has been strongly criticized by the international community over its settlement and land appropriation activities, particularly in the West Bank. In June, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] asserted that Israeli <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">plans to expand settlements</a> [Ha&#39;aretz report] in the West Bank <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2006, The <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website] rejected an appeal by Palestinian villagers claiming that a 6-kilometer stretch of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel+fence">border wall</a> [JURIST news archive] would separate them from their crops. Shortly after construction of the 670-kilometer barrier began in the West Bank in 2002, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/icjhome.htm">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] held that it violated international law.  In a non-binding <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imwp/imwpframe.htm">advisory opinion</a> [text], the court held that its construction violated <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] resolutions and Israel&#39;s obligations under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC document] to respect the territorial borders of the Palestinian territory, deeming the wall &quot;tantamount to a de facto annexation.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iowa&#39;s <a href="http://www.iowa.gov/government/ag/">Attorney General&#39;s Office</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/sept_2008/Child_Labor%20.html">announced</a> [press release] on Tuesday that it has filed a <a href="http://www.state.ia.us/government/ag/latest_news/releases/sept_2008/Agriprocessors_COMPLAINT.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF text] against meatpacking company <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] and its top officials for 9,311 child labor law violations.  The alleged violations stem from the company&#39;s employment of 32 minors, 25 under the age of 18 and 7 under the age of 16, in conditions prohibited under the state&#39;s <a href="http://search.legis.state.ia.us/NXT/gateway.dll/2007codesupp/1/27810?f=templates&fn=default.htm">Child Labor statute</a> [Iowa Code Ch. 92 text].  According to the complaint, the minors were exposed to dangerous chemicals and machinery, worked more hours than allowed, worked during school hours, and were not compensated for overtime work. In the affidavit accompanying the complaint, a government official wrote that the officers knew documents for the children had been forged, and that the company&#39;s hiring practices encouraged the falsification. Each violation carries with it a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a fine of $65 to $625. As a result of the accusations, a spokesperson for kosher certification group Orthodox Union on Wednesday said that it will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/us/11meat.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">withdraw its endorsement</a> [NYT report] of Agriprocessors products unless the company fires its current CEO. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hyX3XViI87nyMkVGFnA5PrjQdocwD933G81O0">more</a>.<br /><br />In May, the same Agriprocessors plant was the center of a <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] sting which resulted in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/080515waterloo.htm">arrest and sentencing</a> [ICE press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">report</a>] of 270 undocumented aliens to 5 months in prison each after all plead guilty to the use of false immigration documents. The guilty pleas in those cases have since been criticized for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/convictions-of-iowa-illegal-immigrants.php">depriving the workers of due process</a> [JURIST report] both because of the rapid manner in which the pleas were processed and the lack of information provided to the workers about their rights.

Earlier this month, Qarase charged that Bainimarama and others who participated in a December 2006 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=fiji+coup">military coup</a> [JURIST news archive] had <a href="http://fijidailypost.com/news.php?section=1&fijidailynews=18723">committed treason</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Daily Post</font> report] by ousting Qarase&#39;s democratically elected government. Fiji&#39;s police commissioner Esala Teleni has said that authorities <a href="http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&id=06090834a31c2303890f538c660a0e">will not investigate the charges</a> [FijiVillage.com report], despite urging from a <a href="http://fijidailypost.com/news.php?section=1&fijidailynews=18847">government integrity group</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Fiji Daily Post</font> report] and Fiji&#39;s <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2358717.htm?tab=pacific">Human Rights Commission</a> [ABC report].

In Thursday&#39;s <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=09&dd=11&nav_id=53408">letter</a> [B92 report] to all UN members, Tadic stated: <blockquote>The opinion of the ICJ as to whether Kosovo&#8217;s unilateral independence declaration was in line with international law is the most suitable track of activity in this specific case...The impartial advisory opinion is considered to be the most deserving interpretation of the principles of international legal order. The opinion of the ICJ would significantly contribute to easing tensions created as a consequence of the unilateral declaration of the independence of Kosovo, it would prevent unfavorable developments in the region and facilitate efforts for agreement between all the sides involved.</blockquote> Tadic <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/vesti/vest.php?id=48448#top">stressed</a> [press release] that by asking the ICJ to issue an advisory opinion on the Kosovo issue, the UN can demonstrate the international community&#39;s dedication to the rule of international law.

Serbia&#39;s view is that Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence is a violation of the UN Charter and <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=S/RES/1244%20(1999)&Lang=E&Area=UNDOC">UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> [PDF text], which reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Serbian state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/welcome.html">Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne</a> [official profile] pledged Thursday that he would &quot;take swift action to restore the public trust&quot; following an investigation which found corruption in the <a href="http://www.doi.gov">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=interior+department">news archive</a>] agency charged with collecting royalties from mineral rights to federal land. In a memorandum accompanying <a href="http://www.doioig.gov/homerpttop.phphttp://www.doioig.gov/homerpttop.php">reports</a> [text] released Wednesday, DOI <a href="http://www.doioig.gov/">Inspector General Earl E. Devaney</a> [official website] highlighted a &quot;pervasive culture of exclusivity&quot; in the <a href="http://www.mms.gov/">Minerals Management Service</a> (MMS) [official website], where some employees considered themselves &quot;exempt from the rules that govern all other employees of the Federal Government.&quot; Devaney recommended that Kempthorne consider firing some employees who remain at the MMS, in addition to those who have already left or been disciplined. Devaney wrote: <blockquote>In summary, our investigation revealed a relatively small group of individuals wholly lacking in acceptance of or adherence to government ethical standards; management that through passive neglect, at best, or purposeful ignorance, at worst, was blind to easily discernible misconduct; and a program that had aggressive goals and admirable ideals, but was launched without the necessary internal controls in place to ensure conformity with one of its most important principles:  &quot;Maintain the highest ethical and professional standards.&quot;  This must be corrected.</blockquote> Devaney singled out the <a href="http://www.mrm.mms.gov/RIKweb/default.htm">Royalty in Kind program</a> (RIK) [official website], the office responsible for sales of commercial oil and gas commodities. There, employees &quot;donned a private sector approach to essentially everything they did&quot; and even considered formally opting themselves out of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sup_05_5_10_sq3.html">Ethics in Government Act</a> [text]. Devaney found that some RIK employees had accepted gifts from oil and gas companies &quot;with prodigious frequency&quot;; engaged in &quot;a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity,&quot; including sexual relationships with business associates, and held prohibited outside employment that they failed to disclose. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iKt4CePAt-tJqdPld1mZxbC4nsXwD9349FMO0">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/10/ST2008091002738.html">has additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Devaney&#39;s office spent two years and more than $5 million on the investigations, during which which about 230 people were interviewed and roughly 470,000 pages of documents were reviewed. One former employee has <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pr/press_releases/2008/07/07-30-08mayberry-guilty.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] to a felony conflict-of-interest charge, while others were referred to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pin/">Public Integrity Section</a> of the <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] but have not been prosecuted. That conviction was the second related to corruption at the DOI since last year, when former Deputy Interior Secretary J. Steven Griles <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/former-deputy-interior-secretary-pleads.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to obstruction of justice for lying to the Senate Indian Affairs Committee about his relationship with former lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive]. Griles was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/ex-deputy-us-interior-secretary.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 10 months in prison for his role in the lobbying scandal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/welcome/default_en.htm">EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Jacques Barrot</a> [official website] on Thursday said <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] is taking a &quot;step in the right direction&quot; by keeping data on search engine users for nine months rather than 18. Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/another-step-to-protect-user-privacy.html">announced the change</a> [blog posting; Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/regulatoryNewsTechMediaTelco/idUSN0847077420080909">report</a>] this week &quot;to address regulatory concerns&quot; and protect users&#39; <a href="/currentawareness/privacy.php">privacy</a> [JURIST news archive]. Barrot suggested that Google further reduce the retention period to the EU goal of six months. Google had <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/google-announces-new-data-retention.php">reduced its retention period</a> from 24 months last year after the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/eu-questions-google-privacy-standards.php">announced it would investigate</a> [JURIST reports] whether Google complies with <a href="http://">EU privacy rules</a> [EU Data Protection website].

Also in 2007, US privacy groups asked the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ftc.php">news archive</a>] to block Google&#39;s acquisition of Internet advertising company DoubleClick over concerns that it would allow users&#39; personal information to be matched with their usage history and habits.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A trial judge in Key West has found Florida&#39;s law preventing <a href="/currentawareness/gayrights.php">gay and lesbian</a> [JURIST news archive] people from adopting children to be unconstitutional and has issued an <a href="/pdf/flaadoption.pdf">order</a> [PDF text] permitting a foster parent to adopt a 13-year-old boy. Judge David J. Audlin Jr. of the <a href="http://www.clerk-of-the-court.com/">Monroe County Circuit Court</a> [official website] ruled that the 1977 <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=Ch0063/SEC042.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0063-%3ESection%20042#0063.042">statute</a> [text] violates both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.table.html">US Constitution</a> and the <a href="http://">Florida Constitution</a> [text] because it acts as a bill of attainder intended &quot;to repress gay Floridians as a group&quot; and violates the separation of powers doctrine by precluding judicial discretion. As part of the 67-page final judgment of adoption, released Thursday, Audlin wrote: <blockquote>The Court finds the foregoing facts to be true: (a) The fact that Petitioner is a gay man is irrelevant to his skills as a parent and his fitness to adopt. Irrespective of Petitioner&#39;s sexual orientation, it is in the minor&#39;s best interest to be adopted by Petitioner, (b) Floridians who are gay or lesbian are not for that reason inherently incapable of parenting an adopted child, (c) In view of the less restrictive alternative safeguards that exist, there is no need for categorical disqualification of all gays and lesbians in Florida from adoption to ensure that no child is adopted by an inappropriate caregiver, and (d) After having listened to and read the legislative history surrounding the enactment of SB 354, the Court finds that there was no non-punitive purpose for categorically excluding every single gay and lesbian Floridian from adopting children. </blockquote> The adoptive father and his partner have cared for the boy, who has learning disabilities, since 2001. Because they have been the boy&#39;s permanent guardians since 2006, the <a href="http://www.myflorida.com/cf_web/">Florida Department of Children &amp; Families</a> [official website] has taken no position in the case. The <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/">Florida Attorney General&#39;s Office</a> [official website] has likewise declined to intervene, although Audlin&#39;s order allows the state to appeal. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald</span> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/679552.html">more</a>. The Key West <span style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span> has <a href="http://keysnews.com/node/5536">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Florida statute has undergone previous constitutional challenges based on legal theories not at issue in the Key West case. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200116723.pdf">upheld it</a> [opinion, PDF] in 2005 as being rationally related to protecting children&#39;s interests, and the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62672-2005Jan10.html">declined to review</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report] that decision. <a href="/states/florida.php">Florida</a> and <a href="/states/mississippi.php">Mississippi</a> [JURIST news archives] are the only US states which ban such adoptions, although the Arkansas secretary of state last month <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/arkansas-ballot-to-contain-proposed-ban.php">certified a ballot measure</a> [JURIST report] which would prohibit gays, lesbians and other unmarried cohabiting couples from becoming either foster or adoptive parents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Retail chain <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/">Walgreens</a> [corporate website] filed a <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/cityattorney/WALGREENS-V-CCSF_COMPLAINT.PDF">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/uploadedfiles/cityattorney/WALGREENS-V-CCSF_APP-MPA.PDF">application for injunction</a>, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/courts_page.asp?id=77500">California Superior Court</a> [official website] seeking an injunction and the repeal of an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/30/BAC7121IRV.DTL">ordinance</a> [PDF text] that prohibits the sale of tobacco at pharmacies in <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/index.asp">San Francisco</a> [official website]. Walgreens argues that the ban is unconstitutional because it does not apply to grocery stores and large retailers such as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F&ei=bnbISJT3AaioepvnoeIG&usg=AFQjCNE8N55VuhGyy_GJzT2yOR_fCMbt5w&sig2=1tPziaVZeF0Of-kdrJK9JQ">Wal-Mart</a> [corporate website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/wal-mart.php">news archive</a>], which have pharmacies. San Francisco, which last month became the first US city to <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/30/BAC7121IRV.DTL">adopt such a ban</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">SF Chronicle</span> report], defends the ordinance as appropriate because pharmacies should provide for health care needs rather than enable harmful habits. A preliminary hearing on the injunction is scheduled for September 30, one day before the ordinance is to take effect. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> has <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/09/10/walgreen-san-franciscos-tobacco-ban-is-unfair/?mod=googlenews_wsj">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/09/BA2712Q9IG.DTL">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Among other recent US developments related to <a href="/currentawareness/tobacco.php">tobacco</a> [JURIST news archive], the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in April <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-decertifies-class.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] certification of a class action brought by &quot;light&quot; cigarette smokers against cigarette manufacturers. The lawsuit alleged that tobacco companies used deceptive advertising tactics to mislead smokers about growing health concerns over the risks of smoking. Also that month, the US House Energy and Commerce Committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/house-panel-approves-tobacco-regulation.php">advanced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would give the <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] regulatory power over tobacco products. Supporters said the bill would help to inform the public of the risks of smoking and make cigarettes safer. Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/supreme-court-rules-in-preemption-erisa.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that federal law preempts two provisions of a Maine tobacco transport law requiring special inspection of incoming tobacco packages to prevent purchases from unlicensed retailers who might sell to minors.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/">Human Rights in China</a> (HRIC) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision%5fid=84825&item%5fid=84810">release</a> [text] on Wednesday saying that Chinese police and other officials still employ <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=torture">torture</a> [JURIST news archive] to elicit confessions and intimidate political dissidents despite domestic and international bans. The group said even though various government agencies have issued regulations against the use of torture, they aren&#39;t appropriately enforced. It also detailed the treatment of one political prisoner who was allegedly shackled, hung by his arms, and had his genitals electrically shocked during an extended interrogation. HRIC executive director Sharon Hom criticized the country for not effectively stopping the practice:<blockquote>Many criminal suspects in China, as well as those who seek to defend the rights of others and speak out against injustice &#8211; lawyers, environmental activists, petitioners &#8211; have become victims of torture... In failing to honor its obligation under international and Chinese law to prevent the use of torture to extract confessions, the Chinese government violates the rights of its citizens and undermines its professed commitment to the rule-of-law.</blockquote>Also Wednesday, China&#39;s Supreme People&#39;s Court <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/10/content_9910793.htm">urged local courts</a> [Xinhua report] to take steps to improve their credibility, but on Thursday, a Chinese delegate to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] unsuccessfully tried to prevent a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.gfbv.de/index.php?change_lang=english">Society for Threatened Peoples</a> [advocacy website] from <a href="http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?article=China+Attempts+to+Stifle+NGO+Statement+on+Tibet&id=22790">criticizing the country&#39;s treatment of Tibetans</a> [Phayul report] during a meeting of the group.<br /><br />China has recently come under increased scrutiny of its human rights record because of its hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Despite the attention, a July&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/089/2008/en/8249b304-5724-11dd-90eb-ff4596860802/asa170892008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-human-rights-abuses-continuing-in.php">report</a>] released by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said the country had failed to make real improvements in the area. The report, which updated an April AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/050/2008/en/b5e6bfd8-0176-11dd-8daf-5b71323cd12c/asa170502008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] detailing ongoing human rights abuses in the country, evaluated the Chinese government on its use of the death penalty, administrative detentions, the detention and abuse of rights activists, including journalists and lawyers, and Internet censorship.&nbsp;

In the <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2004/abbott_braun_baxter.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagNews/release.php?id=476">press release</a>], Texas had alleged that Abbott Laboratories and other drug manufacturers had inflated drug prices that they reported to the state above what they actually charged drug distributors for the drugs. The state and federally funded Medicaid program would then reimburse the distributors for more than they had paid for the drugs, allegedly giving the manufacturer a competitive advantage, and allowing the distributors to illegally profit from the&nbsp;difference. The $28 million settlement with Abbott Laboratories, which continues to deny any wrongdoing, is one of several the state has either <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagNews/release.php?id=453">settled</a> [press release] or is still pursuing against other drug manufacturers for similar practices.

The Philadelphia case alleged that Merck overcharged the federal Medicaid program by failing to disclose that it was offering drugs to hospitals at deep discounts.  The New Orleans suit alleged that Merck offered price reductions on the drug <a href="http://www.pepcid.com/index.jhtml">Pepcid</a> [product website] if hospitals agreed to use their product rather than that of their competitors.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> [official website] announced Wednesday that <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/159_08.html">seven Muslim extremists</a> [press release] accused of conspiring to bomb trans-Atlantic flights will be retried because a jury failed to reach verdicts earlier this week. In a prepared statement, <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html">Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald</a> [official profile] said: <blockquote>I have today concluded that the prosecution should apply to retry each of these defendants on every count that the recently discharged jury failed to agree upon. This will include a count that each defendant conspired to detonate improvised explosive devices on transatlantic passenger aircraft. </blockquote>MacDonald said his office would soon file an application for a new trial. On Monday, a jury in London <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/08/europe/london.php">acquitted an eighth suspect</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">IHT</span> report] and convicted three of the defendants on less-serious charges. The failure to convict the defendants was viewed as a blow to British counterterrorism authorities, who had said the plot potentially could have exceeded the US <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] in scale. Some officials speculated that the development could lead Britian to reconsider its ban on admitting evidence obtained through wiretaps.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Malaysian court on Wednesday <a href="http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=358189">set a September 24 hearing date</a> [Bernama report] for arguments over approval of an application to transfer of <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy charges</a> [JURIST report] against Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] to a Malaysian High Court.  After the hearing, Anwar characterized the move by Malaysian prosecutors to transfer the proceedings as a &quot;<a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/Frontpage/20080910083204/Article/index_html">trial by ambush</a>&quot; [<em>New Straits Times</em> report], while his defense lawyers called the transfer issue a delaying tactic. The application seeking the transfer of the case was signed by a Malaysian Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, who is being sued by Anwar relating to his 1998 arrest on similar sodomy charges. Anwar pleaded not guilty last month to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy charges</a> [JURIST report] based on allegations by a former aide. Anwar has denied the accusations, saying that they are part of a government campaign to upset his political aspirations, including a parliamentary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7581446.stm">by-election he won</a> [BBC report] last month. Human rights groups have also questioned the timing of the charges.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=asia">Human Rights Watch Asia</a> [advocacy website] Thursday <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/07/malays19554.htm">called for the government to drop the charges</a> [press release], while <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] described the allegations as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/malaysia-charges-against-anwar-politically-motivated-20080806">&quot;politically motivated&quot;</a> [press release]. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June.  From Malaysia, <em>The Star</em> has <a href="http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/10/nation/20080910084159&sec=nation">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iE-lC0FfU8eMHjgMP3_OIKBgGdlg">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The political focus on the sodomy charges intensified last month, when a bill was introduced in the Malaysian parliament that would require all criminal suspects to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/malaysia-dna-bill-and-oath-swearing.php">submit DNA samples</a> [JURIST report].  The proposed legislation was seen as an attempt to intervene in the Anwar case. Malaysian authorities briefly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> Anwar in July, less than a day after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-authorities-issue-arrest.php">warrant was issued for his arrest</a> [JURIST reports].  Last week, Anwar released a <a href="http://www.m2day.org/fpdf/rep.pdf">medical report</a> [PDF text and explanation; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-releases.php">report</a>] that he said refuted the sodomy allegations.  Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the expiration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Last month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

Lavrov said the deal approved by Russia only allowed the observers, who are members of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.osce.org%2F&ei=A1nISIryJ4jkesLX2MMB&usg=AFQjCNEQJgVUZtbYW_eYWKnkbhdR_NW5gA&sig2=XLOlJsKC5bvhpMCBo_vBFQ">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] to take up positions outside of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The EU attempted to clarify by saying that it had not made an agreement with Russia on whether the observers would enter the breakaway regions, but that it hoped in time the observers would be deployed in any part of the Georgian territory.  The US, EU, and many other nations still hold South Ossetia and Abkhazia to be part of Georgia despite Russian <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-recognition-of-georgia.php">recognition</a> [JURIST report] of their status as independent countries.   The BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7608720.stm">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> has <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1010/42/370855.htm">additional coverage</a>.   <br /><br />These events come amidst international court filings by both Georgia and Russia.  Attorneys representing the Georgian Republic <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-presents-argument-against.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icj.php">news archive</a>] Monday seeking emergency orders to stop the alleged killing and mass displacement of citizens in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Georgia argued that Russia is engaged in ethnic cleansing and is violating the 1965 <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [text] by removing ethnic Georgians from the territories.  Russia countered that its military actions have saved lives.   Last month Russia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">instituted its own action</a> [JURIST report] against Georgia in the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cpi.int%2Fhome.html%26l%3Den&ei=kmPISOjjEYXGeoCazLgB&usg=AFQjCNGJUlA-BRBuc2s6fmrrdvGtRbGqdQ&sig2=tFj3pq19L_qpG_9Z8NSGpQ">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], alleging that Georgia committed war crimes against ethnic Russians in South Ossetia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The District Court of the Hague on Wednesday dismissed claims alleging the Dutch government negligently failed to protect civilians during the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC timeline; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>]. The relatives of several Bosnian Muslims killed at Srebrenica argued that <a href="/countries/netherlands.php">the Netherlands</a> [JURIST news archive] should be liable for the deaths because Dutch soldiers acting as UN peacekeepers had forced the victims out of a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/Res/819(1993)">UN-designated &quot;safe area&quot;</a> [resolution, PDF] and turned them over to Bosnian Serbs. The court ruled that the Dutch government was not responsible because the peacekeepers&#39; actions were attributable only to the UN. A lawyer for the plaintiffs said they planned an appeal, although she did not expect it to succeed. A similar <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/dutch-court-allows-srebrenica-lawsuit.php">class action</a> [JURIST report] remains pending before the court. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSLA15649320080910">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCOcm8MbzhZt-IqRsdtgafTp234A">additional coverage</a>. Radio Netherlands has <a href="http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/netherlands/080910-srebrenica-unprofor-mc">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The dismissed lawsuit, which the Hague district court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/hague-court-hears-srebrenica-refugee.php">began hearing in June</a> [JURIST report], is the first civil case against the Dutch government arising from the Srebrenica massacre. In July, the court ruled that the UN was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/hague-court-rules-un-immune-from.php">immune from liability</a> [JURIST report]. An independent <a href="http://www.srebrenica.nl/en/opdracht.htm">report</a> [text] found that Dutch troops had mistakenly advised Bosnian Muslims to leave the enclave at Srebrenica, where an estimated 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed. Several of the 161 suspects indicted by the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] in connection with the massacre have evaded capture, including <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/mladic.htm">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) [official website] officials on Wednesday <a href="http://hsc.house.gov/Hearings/index.asp?ID=164">told Congress</a> [hearing materials] that a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=border+and+fence">670-mile fence along the US-Mexican border</a> [JURIST news archive] is unlikely to be completed as planned by year&#39;s end because of cost increases, technological problems and legal challenges. <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/about/organization/commissioner_basham.xml">CPB Commissioner Ralph Basham</a> [official profile] said in prepared <a href="http://hsc.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20080910100939-26969.PDF">testimony</a> [PDF text] before the <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/">House Homeland Security Committee</a> [official website] that although 344 miles of fencing had been completed by the end of August, &quot;we face many challenges in achieving our goal.&quot; He continued: <blockquote>As previously noted, escalating construction costs coupled with competition for construction labor, equipment, and materials has resulted in significant fence construction cost increases.<br /><br />It is also important to note that, cost increases aside, a number of other factors continue to present challenges to achieving our fence construction goals. These include: completing legal actions to acquire private property in Texas, complying with International Boundary and Water Commission requirements along the Rio Grande River, appropriately addressing cultural mitigation issues, and resolving any unforeseen construction challenges that may arise. </blockquote>To complete the fence, CBP is requesting that $400 million in other homeland security funds be diverted to the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/programs/editorial_0868.shtm">Secure Border Initiative</a> (SBI) [DHS fact sheet]. Also at Wednesday&#39;s hearing, a <a href="http://www.gao.gov">Government Accountability Office</a> [official website] analyst <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d081148t.pdf">testified</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-08-1148T">summary</a>] that key elements of the technology-based component of the project - often called a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22virtual+fence%22">&quot;virtual fence&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] - &quot;remain ambiguous and in a continued state of flux, making it unclear and uncertain what technology capabilities will be delivered and when, where, and how they will be delivered.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jE_bOUpQb6MxrxSQno3N6gEdY-MAD9345HG80">more</a>.

This May, a group of Texas officials and business owners <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/texas-group-sues-chertoff-to-block.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to enjoin construction of the fence, claiming the <a href="http://">US Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] had failed to hold fair negotiations with landowners. In April, DHS <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dhs-invoking-legal-waivers-to-finish-us.php">invoked legal waivers</a> [JURIST report] allowing it to circumvent local and environmental laws hindering the fence&#39;s construction, as it had several times before. Also that month, DHS <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/homeland-security-abandons-virtual.php">abandoned a prototype</a> [JURIST report] for the virtual fence after the system&#39;s performance failed to meet expectations. Environmental advocacy groups have <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/environmental-groups-challenge-chertoff.php">challenged the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of actions taken by US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, alleging he violated the separation of powers by circumventing a federal district court decision delaying construction of 1.5 miles of fencing along the Arizona-Mexico border.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of American citizens from Texas&#39; Rio Grande Valley <a href="http://www.aclutx.org/files/Second%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22state+department%22">news archive</a>] Tuesday, alleging they had been denied passports because they are of Mexican descent and were delivered by midwives. According to a complaint <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/gen/36681prs20080909.html">filed</a> [ACLU press release] in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website], the DOS effectively denies passport applications by &quot;demand[ing] that these passport applicants furnish a litany of additional documents to substantiate their citizenship and qualification for a passport&quot; and later arbitrarily deeming the applications abandoned despite proof of citizenship. Robin Goldfaden, an attorney for the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/index.html">ACLU Immigrants&#39; Rights Project</a> [advocacy website], commented: <blockquote>Based on blanket race-based suspicion, the State Department is sending this select group of passport applicants on a veritable scavenger hunt and then refusing to issue them passports without a fair examination of their individual cases.</blockquote>  Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the alleged practice violates the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text], as well as the Constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US government secrecy continued to increase in 2007, according to the <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/SecrecyReportCard08.pdf">Secrecy Report Card 2008</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/2008SRCpressreleaseFinal.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] released Tuesday by <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/">OpenTheGovernment.org</a> [advocacy website].  The report chastized the Bush administration for its refusal &quot;to be held accountable to the public through the oversight responsibilities of Congress,&quot; and took note of extensive quantitative findings: <blockquote>The government spent $195 maintaining the secrets already on the books for every one dollar the government spent declassifying documents in 2007, a 5% increase in one year. At the same time, fewer pages were declassified than in 2006 [...]<br />Almost 22 million [Freedom of Information Act] requests were received in 2007, an increase of almost 2% over last year. The 25 departments and agencies that handle the bulk of the third-party information requests, however, received 63,000 fewer requests than 2006 &#8212; but processed only 2,100 more [...]<br />Invoked only 6 times between 1953 and 1976, the [state secrets] privilege has been used a reported 45 times &#8212; an average of 6.4 times per year in 7 years (through 2007) &#8212; more than double the average (2.46) in the previous 24 years.</blockquote>  Despite such criticism, the report did applaud several Congressional pushes for increased transparency on issues such as information disclosure, whistleblowers, transparency and accountability in federal spending, and state secrets.  In particular, the report commended the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:S.2488:">OPEN Government Act of 2007</a> [S 2488 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/leahy-balks-at-bush-bid-to-shift-new.php">report</a>], which establishes within the National Archives and Records Administration an Office of Government Information Services to review compliance with FOIA policies, among other functions.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jlP3gtmskE1LD-C36YndjYQKyLywD933242O0">more</a>.   <br /><br />Though the 2007 numbers remained classified, the report identified a 4.7% increase in reliance on <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS22406.pdf">national security letters</a> (NSL) [CRS backgrounder, PDF; FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel07/nsl_faqs030907.htm">backgrounder</a>] in 2006.  Last year&#39;s <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/SRC2007.pdf">Secrecy Report Card 2007</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-federal-government-secrecy-on-rise.php">report</a>] noted that across the federal government there was &quot;a continued expansion of government secrecy across a broad array of agencies and actions and some, limited, movement toward more openness and accountability.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.fultoncourt.org/sca200807/">Fulton County Superior Court</a> [official website] judge on Monday granted summary judgment for the state of Georgia in a suit alleging that the state&#39;s electronic voting system is unconstitutional and illegally vulnerable to fraud.  The challenge, filed in 2006 by a coalition of Georgia voters called <a href="http://www.voterga.org/index.cfm">Voter GA</a> [advocacy website], alleged that the system&#39;s lack of paper documentation compromises accuracy and fraud detection, providing no way to perform a recount.  The group asserted that the system violates voters&#39; due process rights because fraudulent manipulation cannot be detected, and violates equal protection rights by creating a disparity where absentee voters use ballots that can be verified, audited and recounted.  The state maintained that the electronic system is more secure than older voting systems.  Lawyers for Voter GA said they will appeal the decision.  Also Monday, US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>] and senior Department of Justice officials met with rights groups and state and local officials to <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-ag-793.html">discuss ballot protection efforts</a> [DOJ press release] for the upcoming national elections on November 4.  Mukasey, who has <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-presents-priorities-for.php">made election monitoring a priority</a> [JURIST report; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crt-585.html">fact sheet</a>] for the end of his term, said that to achieve voter confidence, the DOJ must &quot;[communicate] openly with groups interested in the protection of voting rights and with the state and local officials primarily responsible for administering our elections.&quot;  AP has <a href="http://news.mywebpal.com/partners/680/public/news924138.html">more</a>. <br /><br />Similar challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/voting-activists-appeal-maryland-e.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/nj-judge-rejects-electronic-voting.php">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/federal-judge-rules-no-paper-trail.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] to the legality of paper-free voting systems have been unsuccessful.  The reliability of electronic voting machines drew national attention as the source of <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/judges-asked-to-extend-some-poll-hours.php">delays</a> [JURIST report] in a number of states during the November 2006 elections.  Errors with touch-screen-only systems were the basis for several <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/florida-lawsuit-targets-electronic.php">lawsuits filed in Florida regarding vote-tallying irregularities</a> [JURIST report], with a coalition of advocacy groups claiming that officials in Sarasota County failed to investigate or report various alleged malfunctions with the touch-screen voting machines.  In December 2006, a <a href="http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf">draft report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-report-says-paperless.php">report</a>] from the US <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) [official website] concluded that software-dependent electronic voting machines &quot;are not viable for future voting systems&quot; and &quot;in practical terms cannot be made secure.&quot;  That report endorsed so-called software-independent systems, which do not rely on software alone for vote-tallying and often have a paper back-up system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Senator <a href="http://feingold.senate.gov/">Russ Feingold</a> (D-WI) [official website] introduced a new bill entitled the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s3457is.txt.pdf">&quot;Support for Democracy and Human Rights in Ethiopia Act of 2008&quot;</a> [S. 3427 text, PDF] in the Senate on Tuesday, calling for greater support for individual and political rights in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> [JURIST news archive]. The bill is meant to &quot;build on successful diplomatic efforts that contributed to the October 2007 release of political prisoners in Addis&quot; to help resolve internal conflicts over human rights and political participation.  Co-sponsored by Senator <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [JURIST news archive], the bill also is also aimed at negotiations to settle the ongoing conflict between Ethiopia and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eritrea">Eritrea</a> [JURIST news archive]. Specifically, S. 3427 calls on the President to support democracy, promote and bolster the independence of the Ethiopian judiciary, ensure the protection of women and minorities, and &quot;support efforts of the international community to gain full access&quot; to Ethiopia&#39;s Ogaden region to &quot;provide humanitarian and development assistance.&quot; In order to fund these efforts, the bill seeks to carve out $20 million from the 2009 budget of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) [official website]. Senator Feingold stated:<blockquote>As many in this body know, I have spoken numerous times in recent months about the situation in Ethiopia and I continue to believe that the U.S.-Ethiopian partnership is very important--one of the more critical ones given not only our historic relationship but also Ethiopia&#39;s location in an increasingly strategic region. ... As we turn a blind eye to the escalating political tensions, people are being thrown in jail without justification and non-government organizations are being restricted, while civilians are dying unnecessarily in the Ogaden region--just like so many before them in Oromiya, Amhara, and Gambella. Furthermore, the Ethiopian military has come under increasing scrutiny for its conduct in the Ogaden as well as Somalia, with credible reports from non-governmental organizations of torture, rape and indiscriminate attacks. By providing unconditioned security assistance we are also sowing the seeds of insecurity and creating new grievances both in Ethiopia and in its neighboring countries.</blockquote>Ethiopia has recently come under increasingly-intense international scrutiny concerning its poor human rights record. In June, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/ethiopia0608/ethiopia0608web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] attacking Ethiopian <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ethiopia-ethnic-separatists-targets-of.php">human rights practices in the Ogaden region</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2007, the US House of Representatives passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:2:./temp/~c110lHCyXp::">Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> (H.R. 2003) [text; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2008/01/linking-rights-and-foreign-aid-for.php">commentary</a>], aimed in part at encouraging the human rights situation in Ethiopia. The bill is currently before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In July 2007, HRW accused Ethiopian troops of <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/ethiopia-military-crackdown-on-rebels.php">violating international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report] by burning homes and forcibly relocating civilians in Ogaden.  In March 2007, HRW also accused Ethiopia of complicity with the US and Kenya in <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">secretly detaining Somalis</a> [JURIST report] accused of being Islamic militants. Ethiopia had <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/ethiopia-admits-to-detaining-terror.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 that it detained terror suspects but denied that the detentions were secret.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/08/nepal19778.htm">urged</a> [HRW press release] the Maoist-led Nepalese government Thursday to &#39;vigorously&#39; investigate and prosecute those responsible for the grave human rights violations allegedly committed during the country&#39;s civil war.    In a joint <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/nepal0908/">report</a> [text], HRW and the Nepal-based <a href="http://www.advocacyforum.org/">Advocacy Forum</a> [advocacy website] recommended that even members of the security forces must be investigated for any role in killings, enforced disappearances, and incidents of torture during the decade-long conflict.  HRW argued one of the most important reforms necessary is the failure of Nepalese police to completely investigate formal First Information Reports (FIRs), stating:<br /><blockquote>The 62 cases analysed [sic] in this report show a pattern of torture and ill-treatment of detainees during interrogation at police stations and army barracks. In around one third of the cases, victims suffered beatings, assault, and humiliation before they were killed. None of these cases have been investigated by police for allegations of torture. As torture is not a criminal offence in Nepal, no FIRs have been filed for torture even though torture may have caused death. At least three women victims were raped before they were killed. In two of these cases, the charge of rape could not be included in the FIR because the limitation period for making a complaint of rape in Nepal is 35 days.</blockquote> Because there is no &#39;specific protection of the right to life&#39; in Nepal&#39;s Constitution and relatives of the victims cannot argue that extrajudicial killings violate their fundamental rights, the role of the courts in these human rights abuse cases is &#39;marginal.&#39;  AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080909/wl_sthasia_afp/nepalrightspoliticsjustice">more</a>.<br /><br />The decade-long Maoist guerrilla insurgency <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006 when the Nepalese government signed a peace agreement [text in Nepali] that established the Nepalese Constituent Assembly.  The Constituent Assembly was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/former-maoist-rebels-lead-vote-count.php">elected in April</a> [JURIST report] and is dominated by members of the <a href="http://www.cpnm.org/">Communist Party of Nepal - Maoists</a> (CPN-M) [party website].  In May, the Constituent Assembly v<a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-constituent-assembly-abolishes.php">oted to abolish the country&#39;s monarchy</a>, giving <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=King+Gyanendra">King Gyanendera</a> [JURIST news archive] fifteen days to abandon his royal palace.  which cleared the way for Maoists to serve in government.  HRW has been closely watching events in Nepal, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/nepal-police-put-down-protest-at-china.php">issuing a report in July</a> [JURIST report] that Nepali police had been arresting peaceful Tibetan protesters without cause and sexually assaulting women during arrest.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.trsl.org/intro/">Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana</a> [official website] on Thursday settled a shareholder suit against a group of former executives from <a href="http://ir.aigcorporate.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=76115&p=irol-investor">American International Group</a> (AIG) [corporate website], including AIG ex-CEO and chairman Maurice &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg. The lawsuit, filed in 2002 in the Delaware Chancery Court, concerned improper transfers of approximately $1 billion from AIG to <a href="http://www.cvstarrco.com/aboutus.aspx">C.V. Starr &amp; Co.</a> [corporate website]. The former AIG executives, including Greenberg, were officers of C.V. Starr, an insurance company closely related to AIG, and received compensation from Starr in addition to their AIG salaries. The parties reportedly settled the lawsuit for $115 million, with $29.5 million to be paid by the defendants themselves, and a directors&#39; and officers&#39; insurance policy paying the remainder. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_print/SB122115221952024043.html">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/regulatoryNewsFinancialServicesAndRealEstate/idUSN1129431720080911?sp=true">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February 2006, AIG <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/insurance-giant-aig-settles-fraud-case.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] fraud, bid-rigging, and improper accounting charges with the state of New York, the New York Attorney General&#39;s Office, and the US Justice Department for $1.6 billion.  The money was distributed to investors, policyholders, and other injured states as well as the named plaintiffs. As part of the pact, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] also <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-19.htm">settled</a> [press release] with AIG for $800 million.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] Thursday heard <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/GO0LVSYS.mp3">oral arguments</a> [MP3 audio] in a <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/briefs.htm">case</a> [filing record] brought against four employees  of fraudulent job placement companies <a href="http://user.mc.net/miketoth/fraud.html">ISCS and Receiver</a> [fraud victim backgrounder]. The Chicago-based companies had operated by charging applicants who sought to be placed through the company a $450 advance fee, but <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/057/RipOff0057670.htm">never actually providing them with jobs</a> [advocacy report]. The defendants in the case were four lower-level employees of the companies who either operated phones, conducted interviews, or sent emails to job applicants who the companies sought to defraud.  Attorneys for the defendants, who had each received approximately two years in prison for their participation in the scheme, argued that the convictions were improper because the reliance on hearsay and opinion evidence imputed knowledge of the scheme to their clients. The judges expressed doubt over the argument, but also lamented the fact that some of the organizers of the scheme had received reduced sentences because of their cooperation with the government.<br /><br />The scam run by the companies is called an <a href="http://www.fraudwatchers.org/">advance fee fraud</a> [advocacy website], and strong measures to combat it have become increasingly common. In May 2006, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Justice Department</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/gonzales-announces-565-arrests-in.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that authorities in five countries have arrested 565 people as part of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/globalconfactsheet.pdf">Operation Global Con</a> [DOJ fact sheet]. Officials said the suspects received more than $1 billion from some 2.8 million Americans who thought they were paying to get credit cards, claim sweepstakes winnings, make investments or avoid paying taxes. In April 2006 <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> [official website] issued the <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/media/annualreport/2005_IC3Report.pdf">2005 Internet Crime Report</a> [PDF text; <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/internet-fraud-complaints-reach-record.php">JURIST report</a>] in which it said that Americans had reported a record $183 million lost to Internet fraud in 2005.

Under the agreement, Mugabe would remain president, Tsvangirai would become prime minister and each would have two deputies. During the signing ceremony for the agreement Mugabe <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/africa/-/1066/471236/-/148wlsrz/-/">said</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Nation</font> report] it was important to reopen the country to outside aid, and Tsvangirai said that the agreement was the best way for the country to move forward despite the long rivalry between the two leaders. International reaction to the announcement was positive but hesitant, with the European Union saying that it would lift sanctions against the country if Zimabawe is now able to <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/gena/102742.pdf">reinstate democracy and the rule of law</a> [press release; AP <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-15-Zimbabwe-sanctions_N.htm">report</a>], and the US saying that it <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jrd9Rkss6PhshWoHqzgFePe082Zw">looked forward</a> [AFP report] to seeing the details of the agreement. A Zimbabwean coalition of NGOs <a href="http://www.hararetribune.com/index.php?news=401">expressed doubt</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Harare Tribune</font> report] that the deal will effect real change in the country. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gPauViYZkeWnt3XiPG8dU7b3USGA">more</a>.<br /><br />Mugabe and Tsvangirai&nbsp;had been disputing the results of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+president+election">recent presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive], and the country has since faced enormous <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">international&nbsp;criticism</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] for rights violations that occurred during the elections. Tsvangirai had&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/un-condemns-zimbabwe-violence-after.php">taking refuge</a> [JURIST report] at the Dutch embassy in Harare and the MDC had estimated that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7438275.stm">at least 65 of its members have been killed</a> [BBC report] since the first election in March. Human rights groups suggested that state-sponsored violence would only increase as the second presidential vote drew closer, and in the past few weeks the amount of election-related violence has increased, including the <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5226047&page=1">beating</a> [ABC News report], <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=603140">torture</a> [<em>National Post</em> report], and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/world/africa/22zimbabwe.html?ref=africa">killing</a> [NYT report] of MDC supporters throughout Zimbabwe. In June, Mugabe&#39;s government <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-expels-un-rights-envoy.php">expelled a UN human rights observer</a> [JURIST news report]. Earlier that month, government forces <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-police-detain-us-uk-diplomats.php">stopped and detained US and UK diplomats</a> [JURIST report], threatening them and beating one of their drivers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US has denied a Pakistani delegation&#39;s request to meet with Pakistani detainees held at the US military detention center at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], according to a <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span> <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C09%5C14%5Cstory_14-9-2008_pg7_11">report</a> [text] published Sunday. According to the report, the US said that it does not permit delegations to meet with specific detainees held at the center, but did agree to arrange a meeting for the group with female detainee <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/siddiqui.htm">Aafia Siddiqui</a> [FBI materials], who is being held in a federal prison after being extradited to the US and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistani-woman-alleged-to-be-al-qaeda.php">appeared before a federal court</a> [JURIST report] in New York last month. The delegation had planned to visit the detainees later this month in order to assess their condition, about which Pakistani authorities have <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200607/03/eng20060703_279361.html">long expressed concern</a> [Xinhua report].<br /><br />Last week, Pakistani Ambassador to the US <a href="http://www.embassyofpakistanusa.org/ambbio.php">Husain Haqqani</a> [official profile] met with US officials to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-seeks-release.php">discuss the release</a> [JURIST report] of six Pakistani citizens currently being held at Guantanamo, saying that&nbsp;any Pakistani prisoners facing terrorism charges upon their release would be tried by Pakistani courts.&nbsp;Haqqani&#39;s efforts to secure the release of the remaining Pakistani prisoners at Guantanamo came shortly after the unannounced <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iyKAuQMLoaMc8Dt3I1P-kK5xixrAD932KKD80">release</a> [AP report] of Pakistani detainee Qari Saad Madni from the detention center.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Australian jury on Monday convicted radical cleric <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4416712.stm">Abdul Nacer Benbrika</a> [BBC profile] and five other Muslims in that country&#39;s highest-profile terrorism trial to date. Benbrika, also known as Abu Bakr, was <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24347558-661,00.html">found guilty</a> [charge list] in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.vic.gov.au/">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> [official website] on charges of directing the activities of a terrorist organization, belonging to a terrorist organization and possessing a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act. Four other defendants were acquitted, while verdicts had not been delivered for two more. The group was accused of plotting in 2005 to assassinate <a href=" http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=25">then-Prime Minister John Howard</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prime+minister+john+howard">news archive</a>] and to bomb major sporting events. <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/">Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland</a> [official profile] said at a <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/www/ministers/robertmc.nsf/Page/Transcripts_2008_15September2008-PressConferenceParliamentHouse">press conference</a> [transcript]: <blockquote>It is my view that the successful prosecution in the Pendennis trials is the most successful terrorist prosecution that this country has seen. It involved obviously a number of individuals but it also evidenced a degree of organisation that our law enforcement agencies have been able to - able to prevent developing. And, as I say, we must be alive to the fact that not only would a terrorist event cause injury and death and destruction, it would be enormously damaging to our social fabric. </blockquote>A defense lawyer said Benbrika <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24348274-661,00.html">had not decided whether to appeal</a> [Melbourne <em>Herald Sun</em> report].

The <em>Australian</em> has <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,24347489-601,00.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Benbricka was among 13 men <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/australian-police-use-new-anti-terror.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November 2005 in what was then Australia&#39;s largest counter-terrorism raid. A <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/australia-moves-to-amend-terror-laws.php">government warning of an imminent terror attack</a> that month prompted the Australian Parliament to <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/australian-senate-passes-amendment-to.php">pass an amendment</a> [JURIST reports] to existing anti-terrorism laws expanding state power to allow authorities to prosecute suspects without associating them with a specific terrorist act. Police said the amendment was necessary to accomplish the arrests of several of the suspects. In another terrorism case, the Supreme Court of Victoria Court of Appeal this past June <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/australia-court-orders-new-trial-after.php">upheld a decision</a> [JURIST report] ordering a retrial of suspected terrorist Joseph Thomas, nicknamed &quot;Jihad Jack&quot; by the popular media. Thomas had been found guilty of receiving $3,500 from a senior al Qaeda member and of carrying a fake passport.

The translator testified that he had watched Warner detonate a grenade under the head of Ali Mansur Mohammed, who was being interrogated in connection with an attack on US troops. The soldier, Cpl. Cody Atkinson, testified that he had seen Warner carrying a grenade as he escorted Mohammed out of a vehicle and that Warner later instructed him to say that Mohammed had been released from custody. Warner is <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21586&Itemid=128">charged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/two-us-soldiers-charged-in-death-of.php">report</a>] with premeditated murder, assault, making a false official statement, obstruction of justice and being an accessory after the fact. A preliminary hearing for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=behenna">1st Lt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1283e.htm">convicted</a> [press release] former Bosnian army commander <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/delic/cis-delic.pdf">Rasim Delic</a> [ICTY case backgrounder, PDF; Trial Watch <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/rasim_delic_273.html">profile</a>] of cruel treatment and sentenced him to three years in prison. With one judge dissenting, a trial chamber found Delic responsible for actions of the El Mujahedin Detachment (EMD), which subjected 12 members of the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) to severe beatings and electric shocks and forced them to kiss the severed heads of other detainees. He was acquitted of three other counts of murder and cruel treatment. According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1283e-summary.htm">summary</a> [text] of the judgment, <blockquote>the Majority [of judges], <em>inter alia</em>, recalled the appallingly brutal nature of the acts of mistreatment against the 12 VRS soldiers, which had lasted more than one month, and the physical and mental suffering that the victims had endured while subjected to such abysmal treatment during their detention in Livade and the Kamenica Camp. The Majority also noted that the victims had been detained under strict guard of the EMD. This situation rendered the victims particularly vulnerable. The Majority was also mindful that it had found Rasim Delic to have had imputed knowledge of these crimes, as opposed to actual knowledge. </blockquote>In acquitting Delic of the remaining charges, the chamber found that he either did not have a superior-subordinate relationship with the perpetrators of the alleged crimes or did not not have reason to know of the crimes. Delic&#39;s sentence will be reduced by the 488 days he has already spent in custody. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7617035.stm">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jvYHLDTJ3R2rdlGg7Y2BPBuESnHA">additional coverage</a>. BalkanInsight.com has <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/13131/">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Delic is one of the highest-ranking Bosnian military leaders to stand trial before the tribunal.

After he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/icty-reveals-charges-against-bosnian.php">charged</a> in early 2005, Delic <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/bosnian-muslim-army-chief-to-face-war.php">surrendered</a> to the court in 2005 and <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/bosnian-muslim-commander-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports].

		<title>US Justice Department to ease FBI investigation guidelines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) on Friday <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-opa-814.html">announced plans</a> [briefing transcript] to implement new guidelines extending the FBI&#39;s investigatory powers relating to terrorism. The plan calls for the merger of the <a href="http://www.ignet.gov/pande/standards/prgexhibitg.pdf">Guidelines on General Crimes</a>, the <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fbi/nsiguidelines.pdf">National Security Investigative Guidelines</a> (NSIG) [texts, PDF], and the confidential Supplemental Foreign Intelligence Guidelines, and would allow FBI agents to use more investigatory tools such as undercover operations and anonymous tips while requiring less evidence to use them. One DOJ official said of the proposed merger: <blockquote>We believed that certain restrictions in the NSIG, or the National Security Guidelines, were actively interfering in our ability to do what we believe Congress, the 9/11 Commission, WMD Commission, and the President and the American people want us to do, which is to become an intelligence-driven agency. ... We found some of the distinctions between what you could do if you were investigating a regular federal crime and what you could do if you were investigating a threat to the national security to be illogical and inconsistent with good public policy.  So we didn&#8217;t see the public policy rationale for the differences and what could be done under one set of guidelines versus the other.<br />                    <br />And finally, having these inconsistent sets of guidelines was extremely problematic from a compliance standpoint.</blockquote> Rights groups such as the ACLU have <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/36732prs20080912.html">criticized the proposal</a> [press release], saying that it would allow baseless investigations, allow racial and ethnic profiling, and would promote the abuse of power. DOJ officials could finalize the proposal by the end of this month. The <font style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/13/washington/13justice.html?ref=us">more</a>.<br /><br />In August, US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> leaders <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/">Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) and <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official websites] sent a <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/issues/Judiciary/081808MukaseyReGuidelines.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">report</a>] to Attorney General Michael Mukasey asking the DOJ to postpone implementation of the new guidelines until Congress had a chance to review the changes. Mukasey <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-defends-fbi-and-doj-procedures.php">defended the proposed guidelines</a> [JURIST report] before the committee in July, saying they would take into account not only race or religion but also factors such as travel to foreign locations suspected to be terrorism centers. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] spoke out against the plan, calling it <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=25092&&name=n&&currPage=1&&Active=1">&quot;unconstitutional and un-American&quot;</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/fbi-terrorism-profiling-proposal-un.php">report</a>] and saying that it could allow security agents to target Muslims and Arab-Americans for harassment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in South Africa&#39;s Pietermaritzburg High Court <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/PDFs/microsoft%20word%20-%20zuma%20final%2014%20sept.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Friday that an earlier decision to prosecute politician <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>] on corruption charges was procedurally invalid because Zuma was not given the chance to respond to the allegations against him. In December 2007, South Africa&#39;s <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> [official website] served an <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/south-africa-prosecutors-charge-zuma.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] on Zuma, charging him with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering. Zuma said that the charges were part of a politically motivated effort by outgoing <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election and that Zuma had both a <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/a108-96.pdf">constitutional </a> [S. 179(5)(d) text, PDF] and <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/1998/a32-98.pdf">statutory</a> [NPA s. 22(2)(c) text, PDF] right to state his case before charges were brought. The judge wrote Friday: <blockquote>[T]his application has nothing to do with the guilt or otherwise of the applicant. It deals only with a procedural point relating to his right to make representations before the respondent makes a decision on whether to charge him again. Once these matters are cured the State is at liberty to proceed again against the applicant, subject to any further proceedings he may bring. ...<br /><br />It is declared that the decision taken by the National Prosecuting Authority during or about 28 December 2007 to prosecute the applicant . . . is invalid and is set aside.</blockquote> Officials from Zuma&#39;s African National Congress (ANC) <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=./ancdocs/pr/2008/pr0912a.html">praised the decision</a> [press release], saying that the National Prosecuting Authority had violated Zuma&#39;s rights, and Zuma&#39;s lawyers  said they will move for a full dismissal of the case in November. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a7h2g.T2JNcU">more</a>. From South Africa, the <font style="font-style: italic;">Times</font> has <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=842168">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In late July, the <a href="http://www.concourt.gov.za/">South African Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/cgisirsi/20080731170415/SIRSI/0/520/J-CCT89-07">rejected a motion</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">report</a>] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/ReadContent424.aspx">Directorate of Special Investigations</a> [official backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/435550.stm">report</a>] should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the validity of the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal.  The court also <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/hyperion-image/J-CCT90-07">held</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/zuma9007.htm">summary</a>] that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/south-africa-court-prosecutors-may-seek.php">papers obtained by the Mauritius government</a> [JURIST report] believed to document meetings between Zuma and arms manufacturer Thint were also admissible.  Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/scv/home.html">Virginia Supreme Court</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1062388.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] as unconstitutional a <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-152.1">state law</a> [text] criminalizing the production of falsified, unsolicited bulk e-mail.  The court on Friday vacated the conviction of prominent spammer Jeremy Jaynes, and held that the statute is substantially overbroad because it &quot;prohibits the anonymous transmission of all unsolicited bulk e-mails including those containing political, religious or other speech,&quot; in addition to commercial messages. The court analyzed the anti-spam law using strict scrutiny after rejecting a <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/virginia-appeals-court-upholds-first.php">lower court&#39;s characterization</a> [JURIST report] of it as a trespass statute, to which <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/firstamendment/firstamendment.cfm">First Amendment</a> [text and ALA materials] protections would not apply: <blockquote>As shown by the record, because e-mail transmission protocol requires entry of an IP address and domain name for the sender, the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name. Therefore, like the registration record on file in the mayor&#8217;s office identifying persons who chose to canvass private neighborhoods in <em>Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society v. Village of Stratton </em>... registered IP addresses and domain names discoverable through searchable data bases and registration documents &#8220;necessarily result[] in a surrender of [the speaker&#8217;s] anonymity.&quot; ... The right to engage in anonymous speech, particularly anonymous political or religious speech, is &quot;an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.&quot; ... By prohibiting false routing information in the dissemination of e-mails, Code &sect; 18.2-152.3:1 infringes on that protected right. The [U.S.] Supreme Court has characterized regulations prohibiting such anonymous speech as &quot;a direct regulation of the content of speech.&quot;<br /> </blockquote>The court noted that &quot;were the Federalist Papers just being published today via e-mail, that transmission by Publius would violate the statute.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gjq4yWcJ-Q-FfxMYBMIBPzwR1yOAD935CR580">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091201211.html?hpid=topnews">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Jaynes was convicted in 2004 and <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/nine-year-jail-sentence-for-internet.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to nine years in prison after sending more than 10,000 e-mails over a 24-hour period to subscribers of <a href="http://corp.aol.com/">America Online</a> (AOL) [corporate website], which is headquartered in <a href="/states/virginia.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was the first person in the United States convicted of a felony for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=spam">spamming</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/coa/coa.htm">Virginia Court of Appeals</a> [official website] rejected his arguments that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause. The Virginia Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opncavwp/1054054.pdf">upheld his conviction</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/virginia-high-court-upholds-first-us.php">report</a>], finding the statute was not unconstitutional as applied to Jaynes, but later <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1062388t.pdf">withdrew its opinion</a> [order, PDF] and granted Jaynes&#39; petition for rehearing, allowing him to challenge the statute on its face.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Muslim union workers at the <a href="http://www.jbsswift.com/index.php">JBS Swift &amp; Co.</a> [company website] meatpacking plant in Greeley, Colorado have filed grievances and wrongful termination claims stemming from alleged employment conflicts with their observance of the Muslim holy month of <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/features/ramadan_chart.html">Ramadan</a> [Beliefnet.com backgrounder].  Initially there were <a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20080904/NEWS/109049995/1001">attempts to work out a deal</a> [Greely Tribune report] with Swift that would allow night shift workers to take a meal break before 9 pm to accommodate their fasting from sunrise to sunset. On September 5, when requests for a break at sunset were denied, approximately 220 workers coming mostly from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive] and other African nations staged a walk-out in protest.  All of the protesters were suspended and a large percentage were later fired. According to an official from Swift, the number of workers fired was 101, but a spokesman for the <a href="http://ufcw7.canvastoolbox.com/">United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7</a> [official website] said the number was closer to 150.  Attorneys for the <a href="http://www.cair.com/Home.aspx">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [official website] have become involved as mediators in the dispute.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gux1PsPkRR7lposNk1KasOg65UTgD935ITVO0">more</a>.  CBS4 Denver has <a href="http://cbs4denver.com/business/Swift.greeley.employees.2.816205.html">local coverage</a>.   <br />  <br />In 2007, Swift dealt with a similar issue at a meat-packing plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, where approximately 120 workers abruptly <a href="http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2007/08/23/news/nebraska/doc46ce18f002452357804198.txt">quit</a> [AP report] after they were denied the opportunity to pray at sunset.  Workers at that plant had said they were verbally and physically harassed, which led some to file complaints with the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website], raising provisions of <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text; EEOC <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/qanda.html">backgrounder</a>] prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.  The dispute in Colorado follows a situation at a <a href="http://www.tyson.com/">Tyson Foods</a> [corporate website] plant in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where last month the company <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080802/BUSINESS01/808020330">agreed</a> [The <span style="font-style:italic;">Tennessean</span> report] to give workers the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr as a paid day off instead of Labor Day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Benigno Fitial, governor of the <a href="http://www.cnmi.net/index.php">Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands</a> (CNMI) [official website], filed a lawsuit Friday in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to prevent the US government from taking over the CNMI&#39;s immigration system.  Fitial asserts that the provisions of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN02739:">Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008</a> [S. 2739 materials] allowing federal immigration laws to be applied to the CNMI would force all foreign workers to leave and thereby devastate the local economy, which is largely dependent on workers from abroad.  Fitial also argued that the takeover is against the provisions of the 1975 <a href="http://www.cnmilaw.org/covenant.htm">covenant</a> [text] between the US and the CNMI guaranteeing self governance, and that the takeover is unconstitutional since the CNMI did not have sufficient representation in Congress when the bill was <a href="http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=79507&cat=1">approved</a> [<em>Saipan Tribune</em> report] this past May.  The law may take effect as early as June 2009.  The <em>Saipan Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=83476&cat=1">more</a>. <br /><br />There has been much debate from inside and outside the CNMI on whether the legislation will cause the problems forecast by Fitial, and also whether the lawsuit is a necessary one.  <a href="http://cnmidelegate.net/bio-data/">Juan Tudela Lizama</a> [official biography], campaigning to become the CNMI&#39;s delegate to the US House of Representatives, <a href="http://cnmidelegate.net/official-statements/lizama-on-fitials-federalization-lawsuit/">commented</a> [statement text] that while he does not believe the legislation was enacted in accordance with the covenant, he does not support the current lawsuit.  He added, &quot;the problem surrounding the federalization law is the absence of existing dialogue between the CNMI people and the leaders in the United States government,&quot; and asserted that open communication would allow for greater understanding of the impact from the legislation.  The Filipino Contract Workers Association Inc., the United Workers Movement NMI, and the <a href="http://www.unitedfilipinoorganization.com/">United Filipino Organization</a> (UFO) [official website] have all said they <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/120310/Pinoys-slam-CNMI-lawsuit-vs-enforcement-of-immigration-law">object</a> [GMA News and Public Affairs report] to the lawsuit and will support a protest.  The groups called the lawsuit a waste of much-needed resources.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of former Polish leader <a href="http://www.wojciech-jaruzelski.pl/">General Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> [personal website; CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/jaruzelski/">profile</a>; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jaruzelski">news archive</a>] and seven other Communist-era officials charged in connection with the 1981 <a href="http://www.poland.gov.pl/?document=366">declaration of martial law</a> [Polish government backgrounder; MP3 <a href="http://polskaludowa.com/dzwiek/nagrania/Jaruzelski_stan_wojenny.mp3">audio</a>] resumed Friday in Warsaw. A 500-page indictment accuses Jaruzelski of &quot;organizing crimes of a military nature&quot; and deprivation of freedom through internment, among other offenses. Jaruzelski&#39;s lawyers argue that martial law was necessary to prevent the Soviet Union from taking action against the pro-democracy <a href="http://www.solidarity.gov.pl/">Solidarity movement</a> [official website]. After prosecutors from the <a href="http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/">Institute of National Remembrance</a> [official website] presented the charges, the court adjourned until September 25, when the defendants are to enter pleas. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5grOmEVUhtPUMjamLmqIKRUQa2BxAD9354IB00">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSLC8768620080912">additional coverage</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Warsaw Business Journal</span> has <a href="http://www.wbj.pl/article-42511-jaruzelskis-trial-begins.html?typ=wbj">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />A Polish appeals court ruling in June <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/poland-court-rules-trial-of-former.php">cleared the way</a> for Jaruzelski&#39;s trial, overturning a lower court decision that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/poland-court-wants-more-evidence-in.php">halted proceedings</a> [JURIST reports] while prosecutors gathered more evidence against other communist officials. Jaruzelski was previously tried for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1331686.stm">ordering troops to fire on striking ship workers</a> [BBC report] in the 1970s, but that trial ended without a verdict. About 100 people are said to have died as a result of the martial law declaration and the subsequent arrests of Solidarity leaders, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/963417.stm">Lech Walesa</a> [BBC profile], and some 10,000 people were held in internment camps. The prosecutions are part of a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/31/AR2007033101150.html?hpid=moreheadlines">plan for &quot;moral renewal&quot;</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] pushed by current Polish <a href="http://www.president.pl/">President Lech Kaczynski</a> [official websites] and his brother, former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [COE bio] released his <A HREF="https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?Index=no&command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&InstranetImage=974530&SecMode=1&DocId=1301644&Usage=2">report</A> [PDF text] on the <A HREF="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1340115&Site=CommDH&BackColorInternet=FEC65B&BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&BackColorLogged=FFC679">status of human rights</A> [press release] in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) on Friday, praising ongoing efforts by the FYROM government to improve human rights, but also highlighting shortfalls in the judiciary, law enforcement, and the penitentiary system. Hammarberg wrote: <blockquote>The country&#8217;s judiciary was frequently described by both national and international stakeholders as weak and inefficient, with widespread perceptions of political influence and corruption...<br /><br />A main problem remains the backlog of over one million cases. In 2007, the trend shifted. The improved implementation of the judicial reform strategy coupled with other measures tackling the inefficiency of the judiciary resulted in an increase of solved cases by 8% in the first half of 20079. The Minister of Justice informed the Commissioner that the backlog of cases has decreased. However, lengthy administrative and judicial proceedings remain a problem and constitute the bulk of cases brought before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). The Government is addressing this problem with a series of legislative and organisational measures, such as the adoption of the Law on Civil Proceedings limiting the courts&#8217; &#8216;investigative role&#8217; in civil proceedings and the parties&#8217; possibilities to delay the procedures. A (domestic) legal remedy against lengthy proceedings has been introduced...<br /><br />These reforms are important steps to diminish political influence in the appointment of judges and to ensure an independent and efficient judicial system. However, public confidence in the judiciary remains very low. Several international organisations and NGOs have reported on widespread and repetitive postponements of hearings, low quality of judicial decisions and poor standard of court facilities without separate waiting rooms for witnesses and victims, and sometimes even resulting in in camera hearings because of lack of space. The Commissioner is of the opinion that more efforts need to be invested to enable effective follow through of the judicial reform process and to consolidate the improvements provided for in reform legislation. Such measures should include continuing legal education for legal professionals including judges and other legal court staff, as well as training on improving case management and handling. More resources need to be invested in court buildings and equipment.</blockquote>The Commissioner also found that &quot;police violence remains a problem,&quot; and recommended the creation of a more representative police force which would include more women and minorities.<br /><br />Hammarberg&#39;s report reiterated his concern for the rights and status of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma ethnic minority</a> [JURIST news archive] across Europe.  In July, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/europe-rights-commissioner-urges-change.php">urged Italy to change policies</a> [JURIST report] which he said marginalize the Roma, and he <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH%282008%2918">described</a> [text; <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR558%282008%29&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">press release</a>] seeing harsh conditions in Roma camps and hearing accounts of police mistreating the Roma people. He said that in addition to the harm caused by the policies themselves, openly anti-Roma governmental statements reinforced existing xenophobic sentiment.

Van Hollen</a> [official profile] filed suit against the state&#39;s <a href="http://elections.state.wi.us/">Government Accountability Board</a> [official website] on Wednesday, seeking to force the elections agency to cross-check the identities of recently registered voters against names in other state databases. The <a href="http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm">Help America Vote Act of 2002</a> (HAVA) [text and materials] requires that states use databases to confirm the identities of voters registered since January 1, 2006, but Wisconsin&#39;s software was not operational until this August. Voters who failed the cross-check could vote by presenting proof of residency or by casting provisional ballots. <a href="http://elections.state.wi.us/docview.asp?docid=14778&locid=47">Responding to the lawsuit</a> [press release], GAB Director Kevin Kennedy said: <blockquote>The Board believes it would be counter-productive to rush this effort and to create a significant risk, at best, of unnecessary hardship and confusion at the polls, and at worst, the disenfranchisement of Wisconsin citizens with a clear and legitimate right to vote.</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.lwvwi.org/cms/index.php">Wisconsin League of Women Voters</a> [advocacy website] opposes the lawsuit, which it <a href="http://www.lwvwi.org/cms/images/stories/PDFs/News/LWV%20response%20to%20Atty%20General%20lawsuit%20Sept%202008.pdf">contends</a> [press release] would &quot;cause long lines and confusion at the polls on a day when a record number of citizens will be seeking to exercise their right to vote.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h9pxGlK3YYte2ZHnD5o8YW2RvVRQD93534MO0">more</a>. The Milwaukee <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal Sentinel</span> has <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=793886">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />HAVA requires states to use electronic ballot machines and to create a voter registration database, but the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has exempted states which make good-faith efforts to implement the changes and has worked to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/doj-working-with-states-on-voting.php">remedy the lag in compliance</a> [JURIST report]. In 2006, the DOJ sued at least 17 jurisdictions, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/doj-sues-new-york-over-noncompliance.php">including the state of New York</a> [JURIST report], for missing previous deadlines. Also that year, a report by the non-partisan Electionline.org monitoring group found that more than half of US states had <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-states-lag-behind-push-to-modernize.php">failed to meet HAVA deadlines</a> [JURIST report] for updating voting machines and voter databases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22third+circuit%22">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/071957p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a claimant had produced insufficient medical evidence to recover from a settlement fund established to compensate those harmed by the weight-loss medication known as <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/feninfo.htm">fen-phen</a> [FDA backgrounder]. The Philadelphia-based court affirmed a decision by the <a href="http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] denying Gay Patterson&#39;s claim against the <a href="http://www.settlementdietdrugs.com/">AHP Settlement Trust</a> [trust website] as lacking a reasonable medical basis. Patterson alleges she suffers from moderate <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mitral-valve-regurgitation/DS00421 ">mitral regurgitation</a> [Mayo Clinic backgrounder], or a leaky heart valve - a condition that would qualify her for compensation from the trust. She argued that the district court had erred by failing to accept a single frame of an echocardiogram as sufficient evidence of her condition and by relying instead on an auditing cardiologist&#39;s visual assessment of an echocardiogram. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2128">Chief Circuit Judge Anthony J. Scirica</a> [official profile] wrote for the three-member panel:<blockquote>We cannot agree with Patterson&#39;s argument that, in a borderline case such as this, the measurement of a single frame in an echocardiogram, without evidence showing that the<br />depicted jet is a true regurgitant jet, i.e., representative of the claimant&#8217;s actual level of mitral regurgitation, constitutes a reasonable medical basis for recovering Matrix compensation. To hold otherwise would permit claimants whose echocardiograms show an aberrant jet in a single frame to recover payment from the Trust. </blockquote>Further, the court found that a physician&#39;s &quot;eyeball&quot; assessment is proper when an echocardiogram clearly indicates that the claimant&#39;s level of valve leakage is consistent with that of the general population.<br /><br />The settlement fund resulted from <a href="http://www.settlementdietdrugs.com/index.asp?page=dsp_history">class-action litigation</a> [case backgrounder] against the company now known as <a href="http://www.wyeth.com/">Wyeth Pharmaceuticals</a> [corporate website], which pulled its diet drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine) and Redux (dexfenflura) <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/news/phen/fenphenpr81597.htm">off the market</a> [FDA press release] in 1997. Earlier that year, a Mayo Clinic <a href="http://pph.poweradvocates.com/fen_phen_study_mayo.html">study</a> [text] linked fen-phen, a combination of the Wyeth drugs with the medication phentermine, to a rare heart-valve condition. The <a href=" http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/">Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation</a> later transferred all diet-drug cases in federal court to Pennsylvania&#39;s Eastern District. The court <a href="http://www.settlementdietdrugs.com/index.asp?page=dsp_pto1415">approved</a> [order text] a <a href="http://www.settlementdietdrugs.com/index.asp?page=dsp_documents">settle agreement</a> [materials] in 2000, leading to the establishment of the trust.

The National Archives <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2008/nr08-144.html">made public</a> [press release] nearly 1,000 pages of testimony given by 41 of the 45 grand jury witnesses in the Rosenberg case, as <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/federal-judge-unseals-8-more-rosenberg.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Historians who analyzed the transcripts said that <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_BRUT.HTM">Ruth Greenglass</a> [academic profile], Ethel Rosenberg&#39;s sister-in-law, gave differing accounts in her grand jury and trial testimony. Greenglass <a href="http://media.nara.gov/northeast/nyc/rosenbergcasefiles-greenglass-ruth-pg9132to9161.pdf">told the grand jury</a> [transcript, PDF] that she hand-wrote notes about the US nuclear program which Julius Rosenberg later passed on to the Soviet Union, but at trial Greenglass <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_TRGR.HTM">testified</a> [transcript] that Ethel Rosenberg had typed the notes for her husband.

Speaker of the House <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/">Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/Sept08/market.html">reiterated</a> [press release] plans for a new economic stimulus package designed to &quot;create jobs and address some of the most immediate consequences of the Administration&#8217;s serious mismanagement of our economy.&quot;  Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Chris Dodd</a> (D-CT) [official website] <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/index.php?q=node/4552">said</a> [statement text] Monday that the Banking Committee will continue to probe regulatory oversight and seek legislative solutions &quot;strengthening the housing sector, developing a second stimulus package, and restructuring the regulation of the financial sector.&#8221;  Ranking Republican member <a href="http://shelby.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Sen. Richard Shelby</a> (R-AL) [official website] <a href="http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/TOP%20STORY/1882944/">added</a> [RTTNews report] that the Banking Committee will conduct a &quot;thorough review&quot; of the events leading to the latest crisis.  The <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Banking Committee</a> [official website] postponed a hearing scheduled for Tuesday with <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html">Treasury Secretary Henry M.

Speaking at a White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080915-8.html">press briefing</a> [transcript] on Monday, Paulson asserted that institutional cooperation will provide short-term solutions as regulatory changes are made:<br /><blockquote>[I]n the intermediate and longer term, clearly [...] we&#39;re going to need major regulatory changes, and I&#39;ve spoken a lot about that. And we could use additional authorities to deal with non-bank financial institutions. But again, that&#39;s going to take longer for Congress to do. And right now we&#39;re working with the tools we have, and what you&#39;re finding is that the Fed, the SEC, Treasury, the FDIC -- we&#39;re all working together and we&#39;re going to do what&#39;s necessary to protect this system with the tools we have.</blockquote>  Dodd has pushed to reschedule Paulson&#39;s hearing, originally covering &quot;Recent Regulatory Actions Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,&quot; to address this week&#39;s developments.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gAGWn2PjNS-2o5c1u2_p6Waku8-AD937LTIO0">more</a>.<br /><br />Paulson said Monday that &quot;the root of the [financial institution] problem lies in this housing correction.&quot;  In July, Congress passed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3221">Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008</a> [HR 3221 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-senate-votes-to-approve-foreclosure.php">report</a>], designed to address problems from the country&#39;s so-called &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot;  That bill gave municipalities grants to buy and redevelop foreclosed properties and allowed the federal government to provide additional financial backing to the publicly-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage companies.  Last week, the mortgage giants were placed into a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/07/news/companies/fannie_freddie/index.htm?postversion=2008090711">conservatorship</a> [CNNreport] under the <a href="http://www.fhfb.gov/">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Prosecutors told the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] Wednesday that they plan to revise the charges against former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/latest-e/pressindex.htm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] by Monday. Appearing in the war crimes tribunal&#39;s Trial Chamber, prosecutor Alan Tieger said he would seek court permission to amend an <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">indictment</a> [text] issued in 2000. He did not specify whether charges would be added to or removed from the 11 pending counts, which include genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and &quot;other inhumane acts.&quot; Also at the hearing, Karadzic reiterated his desire to represent himself, as well as his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-asks-tribunal-to-order.php">claim</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS profile], former US ambassador to the UN, had promised him immunity conditioned upon removing himself from public life. <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/officials/bonomy-e.htm">Judge Iain Bonomy</a> [official profile] said the court, in ruling on Karadzic&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-asks-tribunal-to-order.php">motions</a> [JURIST report] related to that defense, would consider whether such an agreement could bind an international court.

Mbeki and Bashir issued a <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/showc.asp?include=president/pr/2008/pr09161913.htm&type=pr&ID=1408">joint statement</a> [text] following two days of meetings, focusing in part on possible negative repercussions of an ICC action: <blockquote>[T]he Pre-Trial Chamber of the application by the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor could seriously undermine the ongoing efforts aimed at facilitating the early resolution of the conflict in Darfur and the promotion of long-lasting peace and reconciliation in the Sudan as a whole and, as a result, may lead to further suffering of the people of the Sudan and greater destabilisation with far-reaching consequences for the country and the region.</blockquote> Mbeki instead backed Bashir&#39;s People of Sudan Initiative, a political solution seeking &quot;participation of all Sudanese political spectrum including rebel movements, tribal leaders and civil society organisations.&quot; The presidents also called for international support of <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] troops deployed to Darfur. The <span style="font-style:italic;">South African Star</span> has <a href="http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4615425">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">applied for a warrant to arrest Bashir</a> [JURIST report] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes for atrocities committed in Darfur. Last month, Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">threatened to ignore</a> any ICC-issued arrest warrant, saying he would not &quot;deal with or respond to&quot; the ICC. Moreno-Ocampo has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">criticized Sudan&#39;s own investigation</a> [JURIST reports] of war crimes in Darfur, calling it &quot;part of the cover-up.&quot; Sudan&#39;s justice minister recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">appointed several prosecutors</a> to locally investigate and try war crimes suspects in <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">internationally monitored courts</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/director.htm">FBI Director Robert Mueller</a> [official profile] on Wednesday defended <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">proposed investigation guidelines</a> [JURIST report] before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] as a &quot;necessary step&quot; in fighting terrorism. Opponents have <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the changes could allow inappropriate racial and ethnic profiling and would permit agents to open terror investigations without evidence of any crime having been committed. Appearing at a committee <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3530">hearing</a> [materials] on FBI oversight, Mueller testified in a prepared <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/page2/sept08/testimony_091708.html ">statement</a> [text] that <blockquote>[t]he new guidelines will replace five separate sets of guidelines with a single set of rules to govern the domestic activities of our employees. The new guidelines set consistent rules that apply across all operational programs, whether criminal or national security. They will give us the ability to be more proactive and the flexibility to address complex threats that do not fall solely under one program. They will eliminate inconsistencies that have the potential to cause confusion and create compliance traps for our employees. <br /><br />The new guidelines are not designed to give, and do not give, the FBI any broad new authorities. The vast majority of the authorities outlined in the guidelines are not new, but techniques that were permissible under certain circumstances for criminal matters will now also be available for national security matters, and vice versa. </blockquote>Judiciary Committee members expressed concern that the new guidelines, which could take effect by October 1, have not yet been made public. In a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3530&wit_id=2629">statement</a> [text], Committee Chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] argued: <blockquote>Allowing the FBI authority to use a vast array of intrusive investigative techniques with little or no predicate facts or evidence raises concerns and may potentially lead to the kinds of abuses we have seen with national security letters and with other vast grants of authority with minimal checks in the past.</blockquote>UPI has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/09/17/Mueller_outlines_FBI_goals_to_Senate_panel/UPI-51481221694340/">more</a>.<br /><br />Leahy and the committee&#39;s ranking Republican, Arlen Specter (R-PA), <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/issues/Judiciary/081808MukaseyReGuidelines.pdf">wrote</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200808/081808a.html">press release</a>] to Attorney General Michael Mukasey last month, calling on him to postpone implementation of the guidelines pending Congressional review. In his own <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-defends-fbi-and-doj-procedures.php">testimony</a> [JURIST report] before the committee in July, Mukasey said the guidelines would take into account not only race or religion but also factors such as travel to foreign terror &quot;hot spots.&quot; Wednesday&#39;s Senate hearing followed another <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_090916.html">oversight hearing</a> [materials] Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, where Mueller said the federal government would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-director-anticipates-independent.php">commission an independent review</a> [JURIST report] of the FBI&#39;s use of scientific evidence in its investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US House of Representatives passed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6899ih.txt.pdf">proposed legislation</a> [H.R. 6899, PDF] Tuesday night that would partially lift the ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive] as part of a comprehensive energy proposal.  The bill, entitled the &quot;Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act,&quot; was passed by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll599.xml">236-189</a> [roll call results]. The Act would authorize drilling activities 50 miles beyond the Pacific or Atlantic coastlines, areas that have been off-limits since 1981 due to a Congressional moratorium which has prevented oil drilling in 85 percent of US coastal waters. Under the new legislation, drilling or other activities would be outlawed in any marine national monument, national marine sanctuary, or the <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/georges-bank/">Georges Bank fishing grounds</a> [USGS backgrouder], located off the New England coast in the North Atlantic Ocean. H.R. 6899 must be approved by the US Senate before taking effect. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gB6bi0EyTozdEPy0KGisTQNaS2PQD938DKUG0">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/washington/17cong.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-lifts-executive-order-banning.php">lifted an executive ban on offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST report] put in place during his father&#39;s presidential administration. In June, Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html">called on Congress to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">report</a>], saying that it should also allow drilling to begin in the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> [official website] in Alaska.  Bush argued that resources currently off-limits to energy companies could offset rising fuel prices.  Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] in the Arctic, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require several years and a massive infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

In 2007, a <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/GurkhasToReceiveBritishTermsAndConditionsOfService.htm">Ministerial Announcement</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/em/uksiem_20072608_en.pdf">explanatory memorandum</a>, PDF] provided that all Gurkhas retiring on or after July 1, 1997 would be offered &quot;the choice of discharge in Nepal or in UK.&quot; Gurkhas who retired from service prior to July 1997 - the year that the Gurkha base was moved from Hong Kong to the UK - are required to apply for visas, which are commonly denied because the applicants are not considered to have adequate ties to the UK. Lawyers for the former soldiers plan to challenge the policy as discriminatory under the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2003/20031626.htm">Race Relations Act</a> [text] and Article 14 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/12002E/htm/C_2002325EN.003301.html">EC Treaty</a> [text], the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/17/immigrationpolicy.military">reports</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military judge has scheduled the trial of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] for November 10, but the Canadian citizen&#39;s lawyer said Tuesday that the date is likely to be pushed back further. According to a schedule set by US Army Col. Patrick Parrish, who is serving as judge for the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission proceedings</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">news archive</a>], the trial would run through November 23 and would resume in December if not completed. Khadr&#39;s military lawyer, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Bill Kuebler, said that if Parrish grants a defense motion for independent <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080813.womarkhadr0813/BNStory/International/home">psychological and psychiatric examinations</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report], another delay in the proceedings is &quot;very likely.&quot; Khadr&#39;s trial had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-judge-sets-trial-date-for.php">scheduled for October</a> [JURIST report], but Parrish <a href="http://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/OmarKhadr/article/497472">postponed it</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] last week so that prosecutors could disclose additional evidence to the defense. Reuters has <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN9G45853420080916?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>. Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gOevy_KoLh3XHQ68a9KPfnNsrUZA">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Khadr faces possible life imprisonment if convicted of crimes allegedly committed at the age of 15 while fighting with the Taliban in <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and spying. He is <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">one of four</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees facing prosecution under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF]. <br /><br />Also on Tuesday, Canadian government lawyers <a href="http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080916/khadr_court_080916/20080916/?hub=TorontoNewHome">argued</a> [Canadian Press report] before an Ontario court that evidence against Khadr&#39;s older brother Abdullah should remain secret to protect national security. Abdullah Khadr is <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-seeks-extradition-of-indicted.php">facing extradition</a> to the United States on <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-charges-canadian-khadr-brother-with.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of membership in a terrorist group and procurement of destructive devices. He has admitted to attending an al Qaeda training camp at age 13 but has denied belonging to the organization or supplying weapons to it. Members of the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/khadr/">Khadr family</a> [CBC backgrounder] emigrated to Canada from Egypt in 1977 and are suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Spanish Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced Tuesday it has banned the <a href="http://www.eaj-pnv.eu/">Basque Nationalist Action Party</a> (ANV) [party website] from taking part in any political activities in the country, because of its alleged ties to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/547130.stm">ETA</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">news archive</a>], the armed Basque separatist movement. According to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/spain-prosecutor-seeks-ban-on-basque.php">request filed by prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] in January, evidence shows that ANV has close ties with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2211696.stm">Batasuna</a> [BBC backgrounder], ETA&#39;s former political arm which was banned by the Supreme Court in 2003. The Court&#39;s decision means party activities will be dissolved and all party assets seized by the government. The Court will consider Wednesday whether to also ban the Communist Party of the Basque Lands (PCTV), which prosecutors had included in its January request for the same reasons. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLG12129420080916?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews">more</a>.<br /><br />In February, the Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/spain-judge-bars-eta-linked-basque.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] both ANV and PCTV from fielding candidates in Spain&#39;s March general elections, allowing the government to shut down party offices, freeze their bank accounts, and cut off government funding. According to the Court, Batasuna had used the parties to help circumvent their 2003 ban and participate in politics. ETA, which seeks an independent Basque region in what is currently northern Spain and southwestern France, has been blamed for more than 800 deaths in bombings and attacks since the 1960s.

The remarks, made by Sudanese Ministry of Justice Under-Secretary Abdel Daiem Zumarawi, came after Special Rapporteur Samar presented the Council with her <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/154/14/PDF/G0815414.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] on the situation of human rights in Sudan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Fourteen Chadian and Senegalese citizens filed complaints with a Senegal prosecutor Tuesday, alleging war crimes and torture by former Chadian dictator <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">Hissene Habre</a> [HRW materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>]. Habre fled to Senegal after being overthrown in 1990, and last month a Chadian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced him to death <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed against the state.  The complaints filed against Habre Tuesday are seen as an attempt to hasten Habre&#39;s Senegal trial. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN657485.html">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j3GPd4aCYw8VqI08yvme90SZfFVA">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. Senegal courts have <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite the issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] by Belgium pursuant to its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure to either try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to try him in Senegal and the Senegalese government later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-chad-president-facing-crimes-trial.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. Previously the Senegalese courts <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">dismissed an action against him in 2001</a> [HRW case backgrounder], claiming that they lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere. In July this year Senegal formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment giving the nation&#39;s courts jurisdiction over Habre&#39;s trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Witnesses before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/webcast/judiciary09162008-1015.ram">presented testimony</a> [video; hearing <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3550">materials</a>] discussing the Rule of Law and criticizing the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] for exceeding the limits of constitutional authority during George Bush&#39;s presidency.  At a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/about/subcommittees/constitution.cfm">Subcommittee on the Constitution</a> [official website] hearing, subcommittee chairman <a href="http://feingold.senate.gov/">Sen. Russ Feingold</a> (D-WI) [official website] opened the hearing:<blockquote>[F]or the past seven and a half years, and especially since 9/11, the Bush Administration has treated the Constitution and the rule of law with a disrespect never before seen in the history of this country...That is why I called this hearing &#8211; to hear from legal and historical experts on how the next President should go about tackling the wreckage that this President will leave. I&#39;ve asked our two panels of experts who will testify to be forward-looking &#8211; to not only review what has gone wrong in the past seven or eight years, but to address very specifically what needs to be set right starting next year and how to go about doing it.<blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>Read Feingold&#39;s full <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3550&wit_id=4083">opening statement</a> [text].  Later in the hearing, <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> [advocacy website] counsel Frederick Schwarz Jr. <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/09-16-08_Frederick_Schwartz_Testimony.pdf">testified</a> [prepared statement, PDF] that current policies and practices need to be reviewed and amended:<blockquote>The abuses that have taken place must be accounted for.  We need to know what went wrong, how it is that mistakes and illegal actions were allowed to occur, and how they have harmed us.  When there are allegations that ultimately are proven wrong, they should be aired and names cleared. When the United States has conducted its anti-terrorism policy forthrightly and wisely, it should be commended for doing so. But given the ample evidence that the Administration&#8217;s unchecked policy is out of balance, it is far more likely that the greatest need is institutional repair and restoration of the rule of law.</blockquote>The Subcommittee went on to hear additional testimony from several members of the legal community, including law professors and other advocacy groups.<br /><br />In July, the House Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-house-committee-investigates-bush.php">heard similar testimony</a> [JURIST report] from witnesses with sharply divided opinions on whether Bush had overstepped his constitutional authority to a degree which would justify his impeachment.  The continued hearings on President Bush&#39;s alleged misuse of executive powers follow a number of allegations of wrongdoing.  Earlier this year, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-invokes-executive-privilege-in-cia.php">invoked executive privilege</a> [JURIST report] to prevent members of the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official website] from obtaining an FBI report on an interview with Vice President Dick Cheney concerning the <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal</a> [JURIST news archive].  In June, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0806/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">report</a>] admitting that it had improperly granted preferential treatment to politically-conservative internship candidates in 2002 and 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The European Court of Justice (ECJ) <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62006J0468:EN:HTML">ruled</a> [judgment text; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080065en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] Tuesday that a drug company refusing to meet &quot;ordinary&quot; orders for medicine as a means of thwarting parallel exports abuses its market position.  The decision comes in connection with a lawsuit filed by Greek drug wholesalers against pharmaceutical giant <a href="http://www.gsk.com/index.htm">GlaxoSmithKline</a> (GSK) [corporate website], stemming from a three-month period in 2000 when GSK refused to provide the entire orders of Greek drug wholesalers for three patented products. In an apparent attempt to prevent the wholesalers from exporting the drugs and selling them at a lower price to European countries where the products command a higher price, GSK sold directly to hospitals and pharmacies in Greece and filled wholesalers&#39; orders to the extent only that the Greek market required.  <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12002E082:EN:HTML">EC Treaty Article 82</a> [text] prohibits, &quot;in so far as it may affect trade between Member States,&quot; any abuse by an undertaking of its dominant position is prohibited as incompatible with the common market.  The ECJ held that <blockquote>Article 82 EC must be interpreted as meaning that an undertaking occupying a dominant position on the relevant market for medicinal products which, in order to put a stop to parallel exports carried out by certain wholesalers from one Member State to other Member States, refuses to meet ordinary orders from those wholesalers, is abusing its dominant position.</blockquote>  The decision reserved for the national court the factual determination of whether the relevant drug orders are &quot;ordinary,&quot; taking in to account &quot;the size of those orders in relation to the requirements of the market in the first Member State&quot; as well as past business relations between that undertaking and the wholesalers concerned.  <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Times</span> has <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c7f11d98-83c9-11dd-bf00-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, EU Advocate General Damaso Ruiz-Jarabo <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=fr&num=79919598C19060468&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=CONCL">advised</a> [opinion, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/ecj-advocate-general-finds.php">report</a>] the ECJ that GSK engaged in abusive practices that contravene EU antitrust laws, finding that any loss of income GSK suffered due to the parallel importation of its products did not cause a reduction in the amount of capital available for research and development.  Ruiz-Jarabo, however, also asserted that GSK could justify its dominant position by proving that its practices are necessary to protect its legitimate business interests.  Parallel importation from countries with lower drug prices to countries with higher drug prices has found <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/65&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">support with the European Commission</a> [EC press release] because it may decrease drug prices in general, but has predictably frustrated drug manufacturers, which have sought ways to prevent the practice.

O&#39;Brien made the remarks at a UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/dpko/index.asp">Department of Peacekeeping</a> (DPKO) [official website] meeting, and blamed the frequent overcrowding on ineffective judicial systems and long pre-trial detentions. At the same meeting, Assistant-Secretary-General of Rule of Law and Institutions <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sga1078.doc.htm">Dmitry Titov</a> [appointment release] said that the shortcomings reduce confidence in the rule of law and inhibit peace efforts. In July, the DPKO <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27460&Cr=Haiti&Cr1=">applauded</a> [UN News Centre report] the introduction of 200 new prison guards by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti">Haiti</a> [JURIST news archives], which faces severe overcrowding problems.<br /><br />Prison overcrowding is a problem faced by a number of countries around the world. In June, the government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> [JURIST news archive] announced plans to <a href="http://www.bdpressinform.org/index03.htm">release certain inmates</a> [press briefing; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bangladesh-to-free-prisoners-early-to.php">report</a>] who have served half their prison sentences in order to reduce the country&#39;s overcrowded prison populations. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/courtsofappeal/3rdDistrict/">Third Appellate District of the California Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/C055327.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-court-upholds-inmate.php">report</a>] that a plan to ease prison overcrowding by transferring prisoners to out-of-state facilities did not violate the state&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">constitution</a> [text]. The UK has also instituted a plan to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/some-uk-inmates-set-for-early-release.php">release inmates</a> ahead of schedule, and Iraq has experienced <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/iraqi-justice-system-overwhelmed-by.php">increasing overcrowding problems</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/home">UK Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] has admitted the unlawful abuse of nine Iraqi detainees, solicitors for the detainees <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/news/news-archive/mod-admits-unlawful-assaults-on-iraqi-civilians-at">announced</a> [press release] Tuesday. As part of the settlement, the detainees are to receive <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iraqis-abused-by-british-troops-to-get-1631m-damages-932146.html">damages</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] of as much as &pound;1 million (US $1.79 million). While acknowledging that the detainees&#39; treatment was unlawful, the MOD did not admit to specific conduct. It also denied that the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1">UK Human Rights Act</a> or the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Basic+Texts/Basic+Texts/The+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights+and+its+Protocols/">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] applied to &quot;Camp Breadbasket,&quot; the humanitarian aid distribution center near Basra where the abuse occurred. The Iraqis filed suit in the UK High Court of Justice, alleging that members of the <a href="http://www2.army.mod.uk/fusiliers/index.html">1st Royal Regiment of Fusiliers</a> [military website] had committed the abuse in 2003 after making the arrests as part of an anti-looting operation. Sapna Malik, who represents the Iraqis, said: <blockquote>It is good that the MOD has admitted that the treatment received by each of the Claimants was unlawful, although its refusal to accept that Camp Breadbasket falls within the ambit of the Human Rights Act is frustrating. The maltreatment of the men was hideous, humiliating and degrading and the legacy lingers with them to this day. We hope that today&#8217;s admission marks the MoD&#8217;s willingness to resolve the claims fairly so that the men can try to finally move forward with their lives. </blockquote>The MOD has requested that the Iraqis provide additional information, including medical reports and witness statements, before it makes payments. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7617959.stm">more</a>. <br /><br />Photographs of the abuse at Camp Breadbasket <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/uk-iraqi-abuse-photos-emerge-as-court.php">emerged</a> during 2005 court-martial proceedings that resulted in the <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/uk-court-martial-finds-two-soldiers.php">convictions</a> of four soldiers, who were <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-uk-soldiers-sentenced-in.php">sentenced to prison</a> [JURIST reports] and dishonorably discharged. This July, the MOD reached a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iraq-detainees-to-get-28m-settlement.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with nine other Iraqis who were abused at the camp, agreeing to pay &pound;2.83 million in compensation, in addition to apologizing and admitting liability. That settlement included the family of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3931023.stm">Baha Mousa</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mousa">news archive</a>], a tenth man who died in custody. Also in July, a report <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-military-may-have-used-banned.php">released</a> [JURIST report] by Parliament&#39;s Joint Committee on Human Rights found that UK soldiers may have used officially-banned tactics to interrogate Iraqi detainees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/index.html">2007 Crime in the US (CIUS) report</a> [materials; report <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/about/crime_summary.html">summary</a>] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] indicates that the level of violent crime in the US dropped by 0.7 percent between 2006 and 2007. The drop follows two years of increasing rates of similar crimes, including a 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-violent-crimes-up-in-2006-for-second.php">increase of 1.3 percent</a> and a 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/fbi-reports-first-increase-in-violent.php">increase of 2.3 percent</a> [JURIST reports]. Specifically, between 2006 and 2007, the estimated number of forcible rapes dropped by 2.5 percent, murders and nonnegligent manslaughters by 0.6 percent, aggravated assaults by 0.6 percent, and robberies by 0.5 percent. Additionally, the rate of property crime, which has decreased each year over the past five years, decreased again by about 1.4 percent. The only <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_04.html#overview">regional increase</a> [state and regional overview] in overall violent crimes occurred in the South, which showed an increase in volume by 1.6 percent. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hnkRQTQ_km8Uv2bFGn1tD72ez2XAD93799AO0">more</a>.<br /><br />After the release early this year of the FBI&#39;s <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/prelim2007/index.html">2007 Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-violent-crime-down-in-first-half-of.php">report</a>], US Attorney General Michael Mukasey <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/speeches/2008/ag_speech_080124.html">announced</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/doj-pressing-for-more-funds-to-help.php">report</a>] that the Bush administration would request an additional $200 million dollars in federal funding to help state and local authorities combat violent crime. Although the $200 million is a significant increase over the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/newsroom/2007/DOJ07-824.htm">$75 million earmarked for the program in 2007</a> [DOJ press release], many mayors expressed concern that the money would only be enough to bolster existing programs and would likely not cover the cost of hiring any new police officers in the small cities and rural areas that the report indicated experienced a rise in violent offenses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attorneys for former US Army researcher <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49717-2003Sep9?language=printer">Dr. Steven Hatfill</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> profile] have filed a <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/files/HatfillCOAdismiss.pdf">motion</a> [PDF text] seeking to dismiss an appeal by former <em>USA Today</em> reporter <a href="http://journalism.wlu.edu/faculty/locycv.htm">Toni Locy</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=toni+locy">news archive</a>] challenging her contempt order for refusing to disclose sources for articles about the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~cih/anthraxinfo/public/publicthreat_attacks.htm">2001 anthrax attacks</a> [GWU backgrounder]. The motion, filed Thursday in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/internet.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22district+of+columbia+circuit%22">news archive</a>], argues that the appeal is moot because Locy &quot;has not suffered and will not suffer any sanction under the order of contempt.&quot; District Court <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2893">Judge Reggie Walton</a> [official profile] indicated in July that he would vacate the contempt order because Hatfill had <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/doj-settles-hatfill-suit-over-anthrax.php">settled the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in which he sought Locy&#39;s testimony. <br /><br />If Locy&#39;s appeal is dismissed, the case would be remanded to the district court, where Hatfill would seek attorneys&#39; fees from Locy. Hatfill&#39;s attorneys, from the Washington firm of <a href="http://www.harriswiltshire.com/ ">Harris, Wiltshire &amp; Grannis LLP</a> [firm website], wrote: <blockquote>In this case, it would be the tail wagging the dog if this Court were to issue a decision addressing whether the district court properly held Locy in contempt to reach an ancillary dispute concerning fees that has not been reduced to an order (and which is therefore not yet appealable). </blockquote>Locy told the <em>Blog of Legal Times</em> that she expected the attorneys&#39; fees to be &quot;far greater&quot; than the fines she would have faced for contempt, noting that Hatfill is already receiving millions of dollars from the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/doj.php">news archive</a>]. A Harris Wiltshire partner told <em>Legal Times</em> that the motion for attorneys&#39; fees was &quot;standard&quot; practice under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule37.htm">Rule 37</a> [text] of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Legal Times</em> has <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2008/09/new-twist-in-ha.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Hatfill <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/hatfill/hatfillash82603cmp.pdf">sued the DOJ</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2003, alleging that officials had violated the federal <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm">Privacy Act</a> [text] by providing personal information and information about him to Locy and other journalists during the anthrax investigation, in which he was at one point named a &quot;person of interest.&quot; Hatfill <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/bioterror-expert-can-question.php">received court permission</a> to question the journalists during discovery the following year, and Walton last year <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/five-reporters-ordered-to-reveal.php">ordered the reporters</a> [JURIST reports] to reveal their sources. After Locy refused, Walton <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-holds-anthrax-reporter-in.php">held her in contempt</a> [JURIST report] and ordered her to pay a $500-a-day fine, increasing to $5000 a day after two weeks, and prohibited <em>USA Today</em> from reimbursing her. The DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-blocks-contempt.php">stayed the contempt order</a> pending Locy&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/anthrax-reporter-appeals-contempt-of.php">appeal</a>, which it <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/anthrax-reporter-challenges-contempt-of.php">heard</a> [JURIST reports] in May. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-hatfill-anthrax-settlement-may-moot.php">reached a settlement with Hatfield</a> [JURIST report] in June, agreeing to pay him $2.8 million plus a 20-year annuity of $150,000. The US Senate considered a proposed federal reporter shield law that news agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/proposed-us-media-shield-bill-prompts.php">said would be beneficial</a> [JURIST report] in cases such as Locy&#39;s, but the bill was tabled without a vote. In August, a federal district judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/federal-judge-unseals-fbi-anthrax.php">ordered the unsealing</a> [JURIST report] of hundreds of documents related to the anthrax investigation, including 14 search warrants issued against biodefense researcher <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93194941">Bruce Ivins</a> [NPR report], who committed suicide before the DOJ could prosecute him in connection with the attacks.<br /><br /><em>Editor&#39;s Note:</em> Toni Locy served as a JURIST student staff member while pursuing her MSL at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 2006-07.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Senegalese publisher El Malick Seck is appealing a court ruling which sentenced him to three years in prison and closed his newspaper for three months as punishment for printing an article accusing <a href="http://">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [BBC profile] and his son of money laundering, according to a defense lawyer. Seck, publisher of <em>24 Hours Chrono</em>, was convicted Friday of insulting the head of state, disseminating false reports, committing acts likely to disturb the public order and concealing administrative documents. Tom Rhodes, Africa program coordinator for the <a href="http://">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy website], said in a <a href="http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/africa/senegal12sep08na.html">press release</a> [text]: <blockquote>Despite repeated claims by President Abdoulaye Wade to end the use of criminal libel laws, El Malick Seck faces a severe prison sentence. Troubling as well is the censorship that has been imposed on <em>24 Heures Chrono</em>. Senegal&#39;s press freedom credentials are deteriorating. CPJ urges the president to adhere to his pronouncements and ensure cases such as <em>24 Heures Chrono</em> are a thing of the past. </blockquote>Seck&#39;s newspaper was one of two <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLI239340.html">ransacked</a> [Reuters report] last month after Transport Minister Farba Senghor, who has since been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7587823.stm">forced out of office</a> [BBC report], publicly condemned them for reports about his personal life. Twelve suspects, including two of Senghor&#39;s bodyguards, were <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iINeVRTnQKUn_D6hppUksjfC7Jkg">tried</a> [AFP report] in connection with those raids, and were found guilty of assault and criminal association last week. They were sentenced to up to six years in prison.  Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN254287.html">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gCc9u67whFVxEgHJO0O18onDobjw">additional coverage</a>. The Senegalese Press Agency has <a href="http://www.rewmi.com/Les-partisans-d-El-Malick-Seck-qualifient-de-politique-le-verdict-contre-le-directeur-de-publication-de-24h-Chrono_a12333.html">local coverage</a>, in French.<br /><br />Senegal&#39;s press restrictions are common to other areas of Africa. Last month, Sudanese security forces seized copies of the English-language <span style="font-style:italic;">Sudan Tribune</span> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/sudan-president-vows-to-ignore-icc.php">threatened to close the newspaper</a> [JURIST report] if it failed to meet certain conditions. In April, the former editor of a weekly newspaper in Egypt was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/egypt-court-sentences-newspaper-editor.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted on charges of spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about the health of President Hosni Mubarak. Last year, two Egyptian journalists were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/egypt-court-convicts-opposition-leader.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em> of libel</a> [JURIST report] for writing a story about an illegal land transaction from the Ministry of Religious Endowments at a secret auction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the monitoring committee of the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly</a> (PACE) [official website] released a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/eDOC11701.htm">draft resolution</a> [text; <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=4053&L=2">press release</a>] Monday praising Serbia for the reforms it has made since joining the Council of Europe (COE) in 2003 but stressing that the country still has work to do. The committee particularly praised the Serbian government&#39;s continued efforts towards European integration, indicated most recently by the September 9 <a href="http://web.uzzpro.sr.gov.yu/kzpeu/dokumenti/ssp/saa_textual_part_en.pdf">ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement</a> (SAA) [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/serbia-parliament-ratifies-eu.php">report</a>] between the EU and Serbia. The country has also shown increased cooperation with the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], but the committee officials cautioned that the Serbian government must use peaceful methods in its dealings with Kosovo, strengthen its democratic government, and institute more aggressive legal and judicial reforms. In the resolution, the committee members recommended that the COE: <blockquote>[W]orks with the Serbian authorities to develop, where appropriate, new targeted co-operation programmes in the fields of strengthening of democratic institutions, local and regional democracy, reform of the judiciary and of the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the fight against corruption, human rights, mass media, and education, making full use in particular of new funding opportunities, including within the framework of the European Union&#8217;s Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA).</blockquote> The Parliamentary Assembly is <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc08/EDOC11674.htm">scheduled to debate the draft resolution</a> [schedule text] in early October.<br /><br />After negotiations began in late 2005, <a href="/countries/serbia.php">Serbia</a> [JURIST news archive] initialed the SAA in November and signed it in April. The EU has made Serbia&#39;s cooperation with the ICTY a key element of its membership process. This July, a Serbian prosecutor said the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/serbia-plans-to-extradite-karadzic-to.php">planned to extradite</a> [JURIST report] Bosnian Serb leader and former fugitive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive] to the Hague to face a war crimes indictment. In 2006, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/eu-calls-off-membership-talks-with.php">suspended membership talks</a> [JURIST report] with Serbia after it had failed to meet a deadline for arresting war crimes fugitive <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/mladic.htm">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive] and turning him over to the ICTY.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> (APA) [official website] announced Wednesday that it had adopted a <a href="http://www.apa.org/governance/resolutions/work-settings.html">measure</a> [petition text; APA <a href="http://www.apa.org/releases/petition0908.html">press release</a>] prohibiting members from participating in interrogations of terrorism suspects at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] and other military prisons where suspects have allegedly been tortured. The resolution, approved by a vote of 8,792 to 6,157 members, represents a reversal in position by the group, which last year <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-psychologists-reject-bar-on.php">rejected a similar ban</a> [JURIST report]. The measure states: <blockquote>Whereas torture is an abhorrent practice in every way contrary to the APA&#39;s stated mission of advancing psychology as a science, as a profession, and as a means of promoting human welfare.<br /><br />Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Mental Health and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture have determined that treatment equivalent to torture has been taking place at the United States Naval Base at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba.<br /><br />Whereas this torture took place in the context of interrogations under the direction and supervision of Behavioral Science Consultation Teams (BSCTs) that included psychologists....<br /><br />Be it resolved that psychologists may not work in settings where persons are held outside of, or in violation of, either International Law or the US Constitution, unless they are working directly for the persons being detained or for an independent third party working to protect human rights. </blockquote>The resolution will take effect by the APA&#39;s next annual meeting, in August 2009. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hceFgkpyWSLRtf5t-Wbx2JNVvniQD9398LVO4">more</a>. The <em>New York Sun</em> has <a href="http://www.nysun.com/national/psychology-group-changes-policy-on-interrogations/86109/">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, APA members passed a resolution stating that the group opposed the use of torture and specifying which practices it found particularly inhumane, including mock executions, sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation. The <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association</a> [organization website] in 2006 <a href="http://www.blogger.com/posts.g?blogID=4079894&label=&searchType=ALL&txtKeywords=american+psychiatric+association&numPosts=25">adopted</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www0.ama-assn.org/apps/pf_new/pf_online?f_n=resultLink&doc=policyfiles/HnE/E-2.068.HTM&s_t=catg=AMA/HnE&catg=AMA/BnGnC&catg=AMA/DIR&&nth=1&&st_p=0&nth=1&">ethical guidelines</a> [text; <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16446.html">press release</a>] restricting physician participation in interrogations, following the approval of a similar <a href="http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/Restricted/PositionStatement.aspx">policy</a> [text; <a href="http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2006NewsReleases/06-36positionstatementoninterrogation.aspx">press release</a>] by the <a href="http://www.psych.org/">American Psychiatric Association</a> [organization website]. According to a <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/abuse.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] by the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Defense Department</a> [official website], psychologists have been involved in military <a href="/currentawareness/interrogation.php">interrogations</a> [JURIST news archive] since 2002. Mental health specialists were also reportedly involved in prisoner abuse scandals at Guantanamo and at <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US Army Special Forces soldier faces <a href="/currentawareness/militaryjustice.php">court-martial proceedings</a> [JURIST news archive] following his <a href="http://news.soc.mil/releases/News%20Archive/2008/September/080918-01.html">arraignment</a> [press release] in connection with the killing of an Afghan man earlier this year. The Army announced Thursday that Master Sgt. Joseph D. Newell of the <a href="http://www.groups.sfahq.com/3rd/index.htm">3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne)</a> [unit website] based at Fort Bragg, N.C., is charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#918.118">murder</a> and <a href="http://www.military-network.com/main_ucmj/SUBCHAPTERX.html#934.134">related offenses</a> [text]. He is accused of fatally shooting an unidentified Afghani near Hyderabad in March and then cutting an ear off the man&#39;s body. During an <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/html/NLSOGlakesArticle_32_investigations.htm">Article 32 preliminary hearing</a> [JAG backgrounder] last month, a defense lawyer contended that the military had insufficient evidence against Newell. A court-martial is scheduled to convene on January 7. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j7MFgsJZzQdoZK0YcNtqYpInG-twD939AGQ00">more</a>. <br /><br />Last year, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/aclu-releases-us-army-documents-on.php">released documents</a> [JURIST report] describing alleged crimes committed by US soldiers against civilians in <a href="/countries/iraq.php">Iraq</a> and <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archive] but showing that troops believed they were following the law in most instances. The materials were made available in conjunction with a lawsuit the ACLU filed to compel the US military to release all documents relating to the deaths of civilians caused by US troops since January 2005. In 2006, court-martial proceedings against a group of US soldiers implicated in the abuse of detainees at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/us-soldier-convicted-of-abusing-afghan.php">ended with only one conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Three other soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/military-interrogator-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to abusing prisoners at Bagram, two others pleaded guilty at the court-martial and five were acquitted. The Army dropped the charges against three others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://english.gov.cn/links/statecouncil.htm">State Council of China</a> [official website, in English] on Thursday issued regulations implementing ambiguous provisions of the <a href="http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=56338">Labor Contract Law</a> [backgrounder] that <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/china-employment-law-goes-into-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] at the beginning of this year. Among other clarifications, the regulations provide that contracts without a termination date do not have a lifetime term, instead specifying the circumstances in which employers or employees may unilaterally terminate. Although the law is <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/01/business/chilabor.php">viewed as a major advancement</a> [<em>IHT</em> report] for employee rights, employers have complained that it has increased operational costs. The law requires workers to have written employment contracts, establishes a right to severance pay, sets a minimum wage and limits the amount of overtime that companies may ask employees to perform. Draft regulations were <a href="http://www.chinalawandpractice.com/Article/1930875/Channel/9929/Draft-implementation-regulations-for-labour-contract-law-issued.html">released</a> [<em>China Law &amp; Practice</em> report] in May. Following public comment, the final regulations were approved September 3 by the State Council, which is China&#39;s Cabinet. Xinhua has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/18/content_10076098.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />The law was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/china-adopts-new-labor-contract-law.php">adopted </a> [JURIST report] last June by the Standing Committee of China&#39;s <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/english/home/index.jsp">National People&#39;s Congress</a> [official website] amid revelations that labor officials had <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/china-labor-officials-arrested-for.php">failed to report</a> [JURIST report] the enslavement of hundreds of people at brick kilns in Shanxi and Henan provinces. Criminal charges were brought against government officials, and a State Council conference chaired by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2836857.stm">Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao</a> [BBC profile] said that those who had enslaved workers or illegally employed children would be severely punished.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/Attachments/080917-01.Indictment.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF; DOJ <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/news/2008/doj09172008.htm">press release</a>] sixteen individuals and companies from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a> [JURIST news archive] and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on thirteen counts related to alleged conspiracies to illegally export electronic components to Iran, in violation of US law and the US economic embargo against Iran. According to the indictment, many of the components were eventually found in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used against coalition forces in Iraq. Specifically, the indictment alleges that the sixteen individuals and businesses engaged in conspiracies that entailed the ordering of electronic components, including microwave isolators, global positioning system (GPS) units, and microchips from US manufacturers through offices in Egypt, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and the UAE, then transporting them to Iran and eventually Iraq.  None of the charged individuals is presently in US custody. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/17/AR2008091703536.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The electronic components named in the indictment are considered &quot;dual-use&quot; technologies by the US, indicating that they have both civilian and military uses. The export of such technologies from the US is regulated by the US Department of Commerce <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.htm">Bureau of Industry and Security</a> (BIS) [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The South African <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> (NPA) [official website] announced Thursday it would <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/UploadedFiles/Nicholson%20judgment%20%20on%20Zuma%20appealed.pdf">appeal</a> [press release, PDF] a Pietermaritzburg High Court judgment <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">invalidating corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against politician <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>]. The NPA stated that the appeal will argue that the &quot;court&#39;s interpretation of the Constitution and the NPA Act regarding the obligation to solicit representations before recharging was incorrect.&quot; The NPA&#39;s appeal will also be based on the impact the judgment has on the &quot;operational process of the NPA.&quot; The corruption charges against Zuma were invalidated last Friday on <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/PDFs/microsoft%20word%20-%20zuma%20final%2014%20sept.pdf">procedural grounds</a> [ruling, PDF text] because Zuma was not given the chance to respond to the allegations against him. Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/south-africa-prosecutors-charge-zuma.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in December 2007 on charges of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering. Zuma has said that the charges were part of a politically-motivated effort by outgoing <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] to upset Zuma&#39;s plans to run in the 2009 presidential election. Zuma is seen as Mbeki&#39;s inevitable successor due to his position as president of the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [party website], the South African ruling party. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/world/africa/18zuma.html?ref=africa">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iAIU920oEhtS06Q6pEOcec8LexPwD938ITG80">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In late July, the <a href="http://www.concourt.gov.za/">South African Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/cgisirsi/20080731170415/SIRSI/0/520/J-CCT89-07">rejected a motion</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">report</a>] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/ReadContent424.aspx">Directorate of Special Investigations</a> [official backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/435550.stm">report</a>] should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the validity of the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal.  The court also <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/hyperion-image/J-CCT90-07">held</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/zuma9007.htm">summary</a>] that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/south-africa-court-prosecutors-may-seek.php">papers obtained by the Mauritius government</a> [JURIST report] believed to document meetings between Zuma and arms manufacturer Thint were also admissible.  Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Thursday passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:1:./temp/~c110xa1vwn::">Second Amendment Enforcement Act</a> (H.R. 6842) [bill text], which would repeal multiple parts of the District of Columbia&#39;s Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, including its semiautomatic handgun ban, its registration requirements, and its mandate that any guns in the home be locked up and inoperable.   The National Rifle Association-supported bill was passed despite protests from <a href="http://www.norton.house.gov/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=121">Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton</a> (D-DC) [official website] who introduced alternative legislation and <a href="http://www.norton.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=863&Itemid=99999999">argued</a> [press release]: <blockquote>The needless consideration of this issue, when the District was well on its way to substantially altering its gun own legislation, was all the more egregious because the city&#39;s representative could not vote on final passage.</blockquote> Norton, the sole representative for the District of Columbia in the US Congress, cannot cast a final passage vote.  <a href="http://souder.house.gov/">Congressman Mark Souder</a> (R-IN) [official website], one of the sponsors of the bill, <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080918/NEWS03/809180332">responded</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Fort Wayne Journal Gazette</span> local coverage], &quot;This Congress has lost faith in the willingness of the District of Columbia to defend the Second Amendment.&quot;  The Senate must vote on the bill before it can take effect.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gVjI9TcCa35RlrXky7c22Ixr7JhQD938OFU80">more</a>. <br /><br />Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/">District of Columbia City Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.dc.gov/mayor/news/release.asp?id=1380&mon=200809">introduced new temporary measures</a> [press release] to further tailor gun laws to July&#39;s Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/disvhel">Duke Law backgrounder</a>], in which the Court affirmed a decision <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-dc.php">invalidating the DC handgun ban</a> [JURIST report]. <u>Heller</u> marked the first occasion that the Supreme Court directly addressed the Second Amendment since 1939&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0307_0174_ZS.html">US v. Miller</a> [case materials]. In July, the DC City Council had <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/washington-dc-city-council-passes.php">passed emergency legislation</a> [JURIST report] to amend the city&#39;s long-standing ban on handguns immediately following <u>Heller</u>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.premier.gov.on.ca/news/default-Search.asp">Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty</a> [official website] on Thursday urged Canadian officials to embrace his call for an outright ban on handguns.  Acknowledging that all federal leaders should use the upcoming October election to discuss the issue, McGuinty <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080917.welxnontarioguns0917/BNStory/National">commented</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Globe and Mail</span> local coverage]: <blockquote>We have an opportunity as a distinct Canadian society to say, &#39;We are not going to do what other countries have. We&#39;re going to do everything we can to eliminate handguns.&#39;</blockquote>To combat increased gun violence in Canada&#39;s biggest city, <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/mayor_miller/index.htm">Toronto Mayor David Miller</a> [official website] launched a similar campaign for a <a href="http://www.premier.gov.on.ca/news/default-Search.asp">country-wide handgun ban</a> [official campaign website] last spring, <a href="http://wx.toronto.ca/inter/it/newsrel.nsf/7017df2f20edbe2885256619004e428e/b5b62748e0d94baa85257424004f7545?OpenDocument">stating</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Toronto continues to face unacceptable incidents of gun violence.  These cannot be fully addressed without a total ban on handguns. Handguns are designed for one purpose and that is to kill people and have no place in our society. Statistics show that in jurisdictions with gun bans, supply is limited and shootings are less common.</blockquote>The <em>Toronto Star</em> has <a href="http://www.thestar.com/FederalElection/article/501314">more</a>.<br /><br />Last summer, Miller and several regional and city leaders, including <a href="http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=163,301856&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL">Montreal Mayor Gerald Tremblay</a> [official website], wrote to <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/handgunban/pdf/letter_pm.pdf">urging</a> [letter text, PDF] the federal government to support the domestic handgun ban and &quot;do everything possible&quot; to stop the flow of foreign handguns into the country.  Prime Minister Harper has yet to support an outright prohibition on handguns, but <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/features/decisioncanada/story.html?id=d28f698e-f313-4eb0-b9a3-03956f4b87fa">maintains</a> [Canwest News Service local coverage] that his government &quot;needs to do more to deal with offenders who use guns to commit crimes.&quot;

Justice Kan Ting Chiu of the <a href="http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=1">Singaporean High Court</a> [official website] told Nair that he had &quot;scandalized&quot; the nation&#39;s judiciary by <a href="http://">accusing a judge of &quot;prostituting herself&quot;</a> [blog entry] in a defamation case brought by <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/AboutUs/Org-MP-MP-Prof-LeeKuanYew.htm">former Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew</a> [official profile] against the Singapore Democratic Party. Nair, who <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-blogger-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges earlier this month, said he had no regrets about what he had written. <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=28613">condemned the sentence</a> [press release] as &quot;disproportionate.&quot; The group said Nair plans to appeal by Saturday, when he is scheduled to begin serving his sentence. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g_-nIBIauDZSr9xDuY8K2Ja8usOw">more</a>. The <em>Straits Times</em> has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Courts%2Band%2BCrime/Story/STIStory_279808.html">local coverage</a>. <br /><br />Under a provision of the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1872-REVED-224&doctitle=PENAL%20CODE%0a&date=latest&method=part&sl=1&segid=888373001-001303#888373002-001588">Singaporean Penal Code</a> [text], insulting a public servant conducting a judicial proceeding is punishable by up to one year in prison, a $5,000 fine or both. Nair faces another trial on a charge of insulting a second judge.

Before becoming a US citizen, Nair was a Singaporean opposition politician.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.judicature.go.ug/">High Court of Uganda</a> [official website] will not try soldiers from the Ugandan People&#8217;s Defence Forces (UPDF) if they are accused of human rights abuses, according to Wednesday statements by <a href="http://www.judicature.go.ug/high.php?id=38">Justice Dan Akiiki-Kiiza</a> [official profile], the head of the Court&#39;s War Crimes Division.  The head justice insisted that the mandate of the court is restricted to the prosecution of members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=LRA">Lord&#39;s Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [JURIST news archive] and that the present Juba Peace Agreement, though unsigned, restricts the court to prosecuting only those crimes listed in the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/UGD.html">indictments</a> [official documents]. On Tuesday, the chief negotiator for the LRA, David Nyekorach Matsanga, said rebel leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> [BBC profile] had agreed to sign the Juba Peace Agreement between his movement and the Ugandan government despite the ICC&#39;s outstanding arrest warrants for him and three other LRA leaders.  Dropping the arrest warrants had been a major sticking point in the negotiations and a condition to the consent of the War Crimes Division.  The <em>Monitor</em> has <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200809180042.html">more</a>. <br /><br />Critics of the War Crimes Division, including international human rights organization <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], have accused both the the ICC and the Ugandan special court of unfairly concentrating on only one side of the 22-year conflict by failing to prosecute members of the UPDF.  Simon Oyet, a legislator from the war-affected Gulu region, <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/news/Local_war_crimes_court_excludes_UPDF_from_trial_71707.shtml">cautioned</a> [The <span style="font-style:italic;">Monitor</span> report] that by &quot;only hold[ing] one side accountable...some UPDF soldiers, known to have tortured and murdered hundreds of people in my region, go free.&quot; To date, Ugandan military personnel accused of abuses during the conflict are subject to military tribunals, which have been criticized both for their lack of transparency and lack of an appeals process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian president <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/09/17/1948_type82912type82914type82915_206565.shtml">signed</a> [statement; <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/sdocs/themes.shtml#206554">press release</a>] military defense agreements with Georgia&#39;s breakaway regions of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">South Ossetia and Abkhazia</a> [JURIST news archive] despite heavy international criticism. Medvedev said that Russia now recognized the regions as independent countries since its <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/world/europe/10georgia.html?ref=europe">conflict with Georgia</a> [NYT report], and that his country planned to permanently station troops in the regions. In an attempt to preempt criticism of the agreement, Medvedev argued that the deals were of a nature sanctioned by the <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter7.htm">UN Charter</a> [Chp. VII text]:<blockquote>The key task now is to ensure Abkhazia&#8217;s and South Ossetia&#8217;s security. The agreements we have signed contain provisions enabling our countries to take the necessary joint measures to remove threats to peace and respond to acts aggression. We will provide each other will all necessary support, including military support. The treaties provide for this in accordance with   Article 51 of the United Nations Charter proclaiming the right to individual or collective self-defence.<br /><br />I want to take this opportunity here and now to stress that any repeat aggression by Georgia (and revanchist feelings are visible there, unfortunately, and the state is continuing its militarisation) would lead to a regional catastrophe. There should be no doubt in anyone&#8217;s mind that we will not allow another military adventure. There should be no illusions on this count. [sic]</blockquote>Georgia&#39;s <a href="http://www.nsc.gov.ge/index1.php">National Security Council</a> secretary Alexander Lomaia criticized the agreements, saying that they were effectively an illegal attempt to annex the regions. Spokespersons for both <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-recognition-of-georgia.php">NATO</a> [JURIST report] and the US have also criticized the deal, and Russia is one of only two countries in the world to recognize the regions&#39; independence. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iWOBeF5vlz9xor2QLaOiSkHo15QA">more</a>. From Russia, Kommersant has <a href="http://www.kommersant.com/p-13238/r_527/Russia_Treaty_Friendship_Abkhazia_South_Ossetia/">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The signing comes shortly after international court filings by both Georgia and Russia.  Attorneys representing the Georgian Republic <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-presents-argument-against.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icj.php">news archive</a>] last week seeking emergency orders to stop the alleged killing and mass displacement of citizens in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Georgia argued that Russia is engaged in ethnic cleansing and is violating the 1965 <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [text] by removing ethnic Georgians from the territories.  Russia countered that its military actions have saved lives.   Last month Russia <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">instituted its own action</a> [JURIST report] against Georgia in the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cpi.int%2Fhome.html%26l%3Den&ei=kmPISOjjEYXGeoCazLgB&usg=AFQjCNGJUlA-BRBuc2s6fmrrdvGtRbGqdQ&sig2=tFj3pq19L_qpG_9Z8NSGpQ">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], alleging that Georgia committed war crimes against ethnic Russians in South Ossetia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website] Wednesday failed to agree on a controversial provincial election bill in light of new disagreements over procedure.  Kurdish legislators had strongly opposed the bill&#39;s proposal to establish a provincial council in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] made up of equal numbers of Kurdish, Arab, and Turkmeni representatives. A UN proposal would have&nbsp;compromised&nbsp;by allowing elections in the rest of the country to proceed without the region, but that proposal was objected to by other groups which sought stricter deadlines and greater independence for the committee that would have made a final determination on control of Kirkuk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, Iraqi law makers <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iraq-lawmakers-divide-control-of-kirkuk.php">reached an agreement to temporarily divide control of Kirkuk</a> [JURIST report] among the city&#39;s ethnic groups, but observers have expressed concern that delays in a permanent agreement may push elections past the end of the year. &nbsp;AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD938SH2G0">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, Kurdish parliamentarians <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/kurdish-lawmakers-protest-draft.php">staged a walkout</a> [JURIST report], delaying a vote on the proposed provincial election bill that they said was unconstitutional.  The bill passed despite the boycott, but <a href="http://www.cabinet.iq/">Iraqi President Jalal Talabani</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">profile</a>] and the two other members of the Iraqi Presidency Council later <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iraq-president-rejects-draft-election.php">refused to sign it</a> [JURIST report] because it had been passed by an incomplete parliament. In February, Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected an earlier draft provincial elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] that will lead to the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners.

In his confession, Ramos said he willingly took part in the killings as retribution for earlier deaths of US soldiers. As part of a plea agreement, Ramos was sentenced to seven months in prison, a term reduced from what a prosecutor in the case said would have otherwise been closer to 40 years. Ramos is also scheduled to have his rank reduced and to be dishonorable discharged from the army, but his lawyer is appealing those penalties. AP has <a href="http://www.ktla.com/landing_national/?US-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy-t=1&blockID=59942&feedID=23">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Thailand delayed a ruling Wednesday regarding corruption charges against former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and his wife <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive]. The couple are being <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-court-to-try-ex-pm-thaksin-and.php">tried <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] over a controversial purchase of government land at a below-market price which occurred while Thaksin was in office. The Supreme Court also issued new arrest warrants for the two, who fled to the UK last month and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-high-court-issues-arrest.php">refused to return to Thailand</a> due to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-officials-deny-thaksin.php">alleged judicial bias</a> [JURIST reports]. According to reports, the Supreme Court announced that the verdict would be delayed until October 21 because the couple failed to appear before the court. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSBKK3805320080917">more</a>. <em>The Nation</em> has <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/09/18/politics/politics_30083736.php">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Thai prosecutors asked the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-prosecutors-ask-court-to-seize.php">seize over $2 billion</a> [JURIST report] from the Shinawatras&#39; frozen accounts and holdings.  The <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Thaksin&#39;s challenge that the commission bringing charges against him is governed by a statute which violates the right to individual liberty. In July, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution reducing fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. In April, Pojamarn <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/thailand-ex-pm-returning-in-may-to-face.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] stemming from a 2003 agreement with the government-directed <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website] to purchase land said to be worth three times more than the $26 million she paid for it. Lawyers for Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawyer-for-ex-thailand-pm-jailed-for.php">have been jailed</a> [JURIST report] for attempting to bribe court officials in one of Thaksin&#39;s cases, and current Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] is <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">facing possible impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] due in part to his party&#39;s close association with Thaksin.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani lawyers Thursday boycotted legal proceedings in the country and continued to hold protests calling for the restoration of all judges <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ousted-pakistan-judges-involuntarily.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">former President Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] last November. According to local reports, some proceedings <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53162&Itemid=2">did go ahead</a> [APP report] at the reconstituted <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Pakistani Supreme Court</a> [official website], but many other courts, including the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> [official website] were <a href="http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53166&Itemid=2">effectively closed</a> [APP report] by the boycott. Also Tuesday, the Lahore district bar <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=55609">canceled the membership</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">News</font> report] of Pakistan&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-ex-pm-plans-to-abandon.php">new attorney general</a> [JURIST report], Sardar Latif Khosa, for his lack of support for the reinstatements. Particularly contentious is the reinstatement of former supreme court chief justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-law-minister-rules-out.php">ruled out</a> [JURIST report] by law minister Farooq Naek in August.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York City Mayor <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/index.jsp?epi_menuItemID=e985cf5219821bc3f7393cd401c789a0&epi_menuID=beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0&epi_baseMenuID=27579af732d48f86a62fa24601c789a0">Michael Bloomberg</a> [official profile; official <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/mayor">website</a>] announced Wednesday that his administration had reached a <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2008b%2Fpr362-08.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1">settlement</a> [press release] in a long-standing lawsuit over homeless families&#39; right to use shelters throughout the city.  The main lawsuit, <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E7DB1430F93AA25752C0A9659C8B63"><u>McCain v. Koch</u></a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">NY Times</span> report], was initially filed in 1983 by the <a href="http://www.legal-aid.org/en/home.aspx">Legal Aid Society</a> [official website].  As that lawsuit progressed through the court system other complaints were filed, prompting the city to declare a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=13&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.escr-net.org%2Fusr_doc%2Frighttosheltertimeline.pdf&ei=jbnRSLuSE5K2eobQ1JcK&usg=AFQjCNFHjtVX5MrD5FMSLEBW19c8YAv_aA&sig2=1wX91N7z3mCNbGl7OGpEGw">right to shelter</a> [Coalition for the Homeless report, PDF] which was enforced through the court system.  The new agreement announced Wednesday is supported by many rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/home.asp">Coalition for the Homeless</a> [official website], and will allow the City to resume complete control in setting its policy for dealing with an estimated 9,000 homeless families, which include 14,000 children.  Bloomberg also spoke highly of the agreement:<blockquote>Today is a historic day for homeless children and their families in this City. We have been able to reach a break-through settlement of 25 years of litigation that will benefit all the people of this City by ensuring that homeless families with children will be treated appropriately and in accordance with legal requirements to which we have all now agreed,&quot; said The Legal Aid Society Attorney-in-Chief Steven Banks who worked on the litigation with the law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-nyhome0918,0,2094962.story">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/city-settles-lawsuit-over-homeless-families/?hp">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />When the suit was filed in May 1983, the plaintiff in <u>McCain v. Koch</u> argued that the shelters in the City were deficient and that the City had not instituted proper standards governing homeless shelters.  The court system oversaw the City&#39;s handling of the homeless situation until 2003 when the lawsuit was placed on hiatus.  During that time the City&#39;s <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dhs/html/home/home.shtml">Department of Homeless Services</a> (DHS) [official website] made numerous changes to the family shelter system.  In 2005 the litigation resumed, against the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cccnewyork.org%2Fpublications%2FEAU04pr.pdf&ei=RMHRSOyMPKTYeK757aAK&usg=AFQjCNHeEP6Jq3NKa_zghPuku3Ge6XFv0w&sig2=J0VQ2Imj9mifjKd9ARfZAQ">recommendation</a> [text, PDF] of a court appointed special masters panel, and in 2006 the City moved for dismissal on the grounds that the issues in the complaint had been resolved.  During those proceedings, talks between both sides resulted in the settlement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Three <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] soldiers were charged with murder Wednesday for their alleged roles in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/middleeast/27abuse.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">killings of four Iraqis in April 2007</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">NY Times</span> report].  Sgt 1st Class Joseph Mayo, Sgt John Hatley, and Sgt Michael Leahy Jr, who were formerly part of the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th Infantry</a> [unit website], were all charged with premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit premeditated murder, and obstruction of justice.  The men are accused of blindfolding and shooting the Iraqis, then discarding the bodies in a canal near Baghdad.  It is said the killings were committed as revenge for the January 2007 deaths of two US soldiers.  Four other soldiers from that unit have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the killings.  The CBC has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/09/17/iraq-ustroops-killings.html">more</a>.  VOA has <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-09-17-voa55.cfm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Similar charges are pending in several other actions against US military personnel accused of wrongdoing during their service in Iraq. Eight US Marines were charged in connection with the November 2005 killings of 24 Iraqi civilians in <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Haditha/Haditha-Timeline.htm">Haditha</a> [USMC timeline; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haditha">news archive</a>].  In June, a military judge dropped charges against battalion commander <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jeffrey+Chessani">Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani</a> [JURIST news archive] after Chessani faced <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/two-us-marines-facing-court-martial-for.php">court-martial</a> [JURIST report] for dereliction of duty and violation of a lawful order based on allegations that he failed to properly investigate the Haditha shootings.  Chessani was the highest ranking of the eight Marines initially charged in connection to the Haditha incident, and <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Haditha/Haditha-Preferred-Charges-061221.htm">charges</a> [text] have since been dropped against all but one. The court-martial of <a href="http://www.frankwuterich.com/">Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich</a> [defense website], leader of the squad implicated in the killings, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed indefinitely</a> [JURIST report] in March. Also in June, US Marine Corps <a href="http://www.innocentmarine.com/">1st Lt. Andrew Grayson</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andrew+grayson">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-marine-cleared-of-all-charges-in.php">cleared on all counts</a>, including charges that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/haditha-killings-photo-evidence-ordered.php">ordered a subordinate officer to delete photographic evidence</a> [JURIST reports] of the killings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/F05A5F67FDA9AEE6882574C7005021AB/$file/0717272.pdf?openelement">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; Reuters <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1729901720080918">report</a>] as constitutional an Arizona law which revokes the business licenses of employers who hire illegal immigrants.  Pro-immigration, business, and civil rights groups such as the <a href="www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] had challenged the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azleg.gov%2Flegtext%2F48leg%2F1r%2Fbills%2Fhb2779c.pdf&ei=KX7SSJvJEZT6Mq_s1JYK&usg=AFQjCNF4a5XPQUr-T7i6o8uCtl-oyZwI1Q&sig2=lQlfkDsquUG5PHrIKqYI1Q">Legal Arizona Workers Act</a> [text, PDF], arguing that it violated employers&#8217; due process rights by denying them the chance to contest allegations before the revocation of their licenses, and that the law was preempted by federal immigration laws.  Lawyers for the state contended that while federal hiring regulations prevent states from imposing civil or criminal penalties against businesses for illegal hirings, states may still use their licensing procedures to punish violators.  The Ninth Circuit held that the law <blockquote>can and should be reasonably interpreted to allow employers, before any license can be adversely affected, to present evidence to rebut the presumption that an employee is unauthorized.</blockquote>  The court noted that because the law has not yet been enforced against any employer, future challenges to the law&#39;s application will not be controlled by Wednesday&#39;s decision.  The court went on to conclude that the Act reflects the &quot;rising frustration with the United States Congress&#39;s failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform,&quot; and did not overstep the state&#39;s authority to regulate immigration. In February, the Ninth Circuit had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/valledelsol_v_goddard_orderdenyinginjunction.pdf">upheld</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-appeals-court-denies-injunction.php">report</a>] a district court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-judge-denies-injunction-against.php">denial</a> [JURIST report] of an emergency injunction to block enforcement of the Arizona law. <br /><br />The subject of illegal immigration has become a hotly-debated issue in the US in recent years, and last year environmental advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/environmental-groups-challenge-chertoff.php">challenged the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of actions taken by US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, alleging he violated the separation of powers by circumventing a federal district court decision delaying construction of 1.5 miles of fencing along the Arizona-Mexico border. Last week, US <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection</a> (CBP) [official website] officials <a href="http://hsc.house.gov/Hearings/index.asp?ID=164">told Congress</a> [hearing materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/done-customs-officials-explain-delay-in.php">report</a>] that a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=border+and+fence">670-mile fence along the US-Mexican border</a> [JURIST news archive] is unlikely to be completed by year&#39;s end, largely because of legal challenges.

The ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which was approved by a voice vote, purports to &quot;restore the intent and protections&quot; of the landmark civil rights legislation. The bill expressly overrules holdings by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] in two major ADA cases: <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1943.ZS.html">Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.</a> (1999) [text], which directs courts to consider &quot;mitigating measures&quot; such as medication when determining whether an individual is disabled, and <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-1089.ZO.html">Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</a> (2002) [text], which requires strict interpretation of the ADA&#39;s definition of a disability. US <a href="http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/">Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.</a> (R-WI) [official website], a prime sponsor of the bill, said in <a href="http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=102681">remarks</a> [text] on the House floor: <blockquote>The bill we pass today will restore the full meaning of equal protection under the law and all the promises that our Nation has to offer.  As Members are well-aware by now, the Supreme Court has slowly chipped away at the broad protections of the ADA and has created a new set of barriers for disabled Americans. The Court&#39;s rulings currently exclude millions of disabled Americans from the ADA&#39;s protections&#8212;the very citizens that Congress expressly sought to include within the scope of the Act in 1990. </blockquote>The <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/default">US Chamber of Commerce</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="http://finchannel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20017&Itemid=8">praised the bill</a> [press release], calling it a &quot;a sound compromise between the Senate, the House, the business community, and the disability community.&quot; In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080917-9.html">statement</a> [text], White House press secretary Dana Perino said the president &quot;looks forward&quot; to signing the bill and &quot;is encouraged by the improvements made to the bill during the legislative process.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hycZmTaMXrtFv-4Nch6MJqTSyL0QD938O9A00">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/washington/18rights.html?hp">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The US is one of only 45 countries in the world with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=disability">disability legislation</a> [JURIST news archive], having enacted the ADA in 1990.  The UN General Assembly in 2006 adopted an <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/">international treaty on the rights of persons with disabilities</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-general-assembly-approves-landmark.php">report</a>], which <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/un-disability-rights-treaty-entering.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in May of this year after it was ratified by 20 nations.  The US said that it <a href="http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&itemid=3589">would not sign</a> [<em>New Standard</em> report] the international accord, insisting that US domestic measures on the federal, state and local levels are already adequate for the purpose.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] voted Wednesday to open an impeachment investigation of <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/public/home.nsf/hisj">US District Judge Thomas Porteous</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], who is accused of perjury and accepting bribes from lawyers. The committee unanimously approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/t2GPO/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:hr1448eh.txt.pdf">resolution</a> [PDF text] creating a task force to conduct the inquiry, which is the first of a sitting federal judge in nearly 20 years. The resolution authorizes the task force to take affidavits and depositions, issue subpoenas and hire staff. In a <a href="http://www.judiciary.house.gov/news/080916.html">press release</a> [text], committee Chairman <a href="http://www.house.gov/conyers/bio.shtml">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official profile] said: <blockquote>We take it very seriously when the governing body of the Judiciary sends us a referral for impeachment. Upon review, we believe this matter merits a full investigation. </blockquote>The <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/judconf.html">Judicial Conference of the United States</a> [official website], the governing body of the US judiciary, <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/news/news/PorteousOrder/CERTIFICATE%20TO%20THE%20SPEAKER.PDF">recommended</a> [PDF text] in June that the House consider impeachment. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFy0z8X8f-FZEh8TsfEFFrEVOfHgD938NGO80">more</a>. From New Orleans, the <em>Times-Picayune</em> has <a href="http://www.nola.com/timespic/stories/index.ssf?/base/library-155/1221716243166610.xml&coll=1">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />After an <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/news/news/PorteousOrder/REPORT%20BY%20SPECIAL%20INVESTIGATORY%20COMMITTEE.PDF">investigation</a> [report text, PDF] by a special committee, the Judicial Conference found &quot;substantial evidence&quot; that Porteous had signed false financial disclosure forms, falsified statements in a personal bankruptcy proceeding, made false representations to secure a bank loan, and violated <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC00201.html">criminal laws</a> and <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/guide/vol2/ch1.html">ethical rules</a> [text] by soliciting and receiving &quot;cash and other things of value&quot; from lawyers in a bench trial over which he was presiding. Porteous&#39; decision in that case, <u>In re Liljeberg enters, Inc. v.

The US Constitution gives the House the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/impeach/constitution.html">power to impeach</a> [academic backgrounder] &quot;all civil Officers of the United States&quot; on suspicion of &quot;high Crimes and Misdemeanors.&quot; Conviction and removal from office requires a two-thirds vote of the US Senate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile] expressed concern with several UK asylum and immigration procedures in a <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1339037&Site=CommDH&BackColorInternet=FEC65B&BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&BackColorLogged=FFC679">memorandum</a> [text] released Friday. The memorandum was the result of visits by Hammarberg to the UK last February and March, which included visits to the <a href="http://www.serco.com/markets/homeaffairs/immigration/detention/colnbrook/index.asp">Colnbrook</a> and <a href="http://www.serco.com/markets/homeaffairs/immigration/detention/yarlswood/index.asp">Yarl&#39;s Wood</a> Immigration Removal Centres [corporate websites]. Hammarberg flagged the UK&#39;s Detained Fast Track program, under which administrative and judicial proceedings are aimed at an accelerated determination of refugee status applications which are proved to be unfounded. He said the process conflicts with the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] and the established case law of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], and that the acceleration of immigration adjudication proceedings violates rule of law principles in the interest of meeting time objectives set by Parliament. He recommended that the UK &quot;consider regulating this issue by introducing special legislation fully in compliance with the standards laid down by the European Convention on Human Rights,&quot; and that the <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/">UK Border Agency</a> [official website] &quot;adopt a more cautious and flexible approach towards the &#39;Fast Track Processes&#39; and its announced policy of making and enforcing the majority of asylum decisions within six months.&quot; Hammarberg also recommended that the UK enter into full compliance with <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0009:EN:HTML">Council Directive 2003/9/EC</a> [text] on the minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7624395.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Responding to Hammarberg&#39;s memorandum and recommendations, the UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office</a> [official website] said that only a small proportion of all asylum seekers, around ten percent of the total, are subject to the Detained Fast Track process, and insisted that &quot;the operation of the Detained Fast Track process within existing time frames is reasonable and fair.&quot; The UK government also asserts in the memorandum that it is in full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, the ECHR case law, and that Council Directive 2003/9/EC is already considered to apply to immigration detention facilities in the UK.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] announced Saturday that he would resign as president of South Africa in the wake of allegations that he had interfered in a corruption case against political rival and current <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> [party website] leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month Judge Chris Nicholson effectively <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the latest case against Zuma on the grounds that Zuma had been deprived of the chance to respond to claims made against him and that &quot;political meddling&quot; in the case by Mbeki and others could not be excluded. Zuma had said that the charges were part of a politically motivated effort by Mbeki to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election and that Zuma had both a constitutional and statutory right to state his case before charges were brought. Following a direct call for his resignation by top ANC officials Friday, Mbeki issued a <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/showc.asp?include=president/pr/2008/pr09201513.htm&type=pr&ID=1415">statement</a> [text] saying he &quot;will step down after all constitutional requirements have been met&quot;. Observers expect this to be in the next few days following meetings Mbeki has already scheduled at the UN in New York in conjunction with the latest session of the General Assembly. <br /><br />Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/">Senate Democrats</a> [party website] on Monday questioned the constitutionality of the Bush administration&#39;s <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1150.htm">proposal</a> [fact sheet] to stabilize financial markets and introduced their own <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Articles.Detail&Article_id=0e1cd224-b6e7-446d-a8fb-e96c7ebc7f24">plan</a> [materials] allowing courts to review purchases of troubled assets by the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov">Treasury Department</a> [official website]. The administration&#39;s proposed legislation, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080922.html">submitted to Congress</a> [White House statement; AP <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ioHc80xKMiATnqCpK0cDKJzk_nPQD93AKNT00">report</a>] on Saturday, would authorize the Treasury to acquire as much as $700 billion in mortgages and other loans. US <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Christopher Dodd</a> (D-CT), chairman of the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/">Senate Banking Committee</a> [official websites], criticized a provision in the administration&#39;s proposal that would preclude judicial oversight of the purchases, which Dodd said &quot;may be illegal.&quot; An alternative proposal by Dodd and other Democrats would permit courts to set aside purchases found to be &quot;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law.&quot; That language was written by <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/">Sen. Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT), chairman of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, who <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200809/092208a.html">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>I would like to see progress toward a balanced bill to address the disastrous effects of eight years of the Bush administration&#39;s hands-off economic policies. But passing legislation that eliminates the role of the courts in reviewing the decisions and policies of the administration invites abuse. <br /><br />I am pleased Senator Dodd has included my language to allow for court review in his proposal. As the Congress considers this important legislation, I hope we are careful to ensure that the American taxpayers&#8217; money is not misspent, misplaced, and mishandled, without even so much as the possibility of review and recourse for bad decisions. </blockquote>The Treasury has asked Congress to consider the administration&#39;s proposal this week. Bloomberg News has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&sid=anlrVtS4AanM&refer=home">more</a>.<br /><br />Some observers have expressed concern that the Bush proposal would represent an unconstitutional delegation of the spending powers granted to Congress by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html">Article I of the US Constitution</a> [text]. In 1935, in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/295/495/case.html">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</a> [text], the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] struck down part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=66">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> [materials] as violating the nondelegation doctrine, finding that that law gave the president &quot;virtually unfettered&quot; discretion in enacting trade regulations. Since then, the court has consistently upheld broad delegations of power to the executive branch. In a 1989 case challenging federal sentencing guidelines developed by the US <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">Sentencing Commission</a> [official website], the court <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/488/361/case.html">held</a> [<u>Mistretta v. US</u> text] that Congress may make such a delegation as long as it provides an &quot;intelligible principle&quot; to guide administrative decisionmaking.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Canadian <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court</a> [official website] granted a last-minute stay of removal Monday for US Army deserter <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hinzman">Jeremy Hinzman</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hinzman fled to Canada from the US in January 2004 after leaving his unit, rather than deploy to Iraq. Hinzman had <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/us-soldier-ordered-to-iraq-seeks.htm">applied for asylum</a> [JURIST report] in Canada and <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/us-deserter-accuses-us-of-war-crimes.htm">accused the US of war crimes in Iraq</a> [JURIST report]. Federal Court <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Mosley">Justice Richard Mosley</a> [official profile] issued the stay of removal after <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXiXERfSZmX3FKlhXl-NIp_cDWog">hearing evidence</a> [Canadian Press report] that an <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/index_e.htm">Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada</a> (IRB) [official website] official had made serious errors in assessing the hardships Hinzman and his family would face if forced back to the US. CBC News has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/09/22/hinzman-stay.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last November, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/Welcome/index_e.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] declined to hear the appeals of Hinzman and another US deserter, Brandon Hughey, of the IRB denials of their asylum applications. Both Hinzman and Hughey cited moral objections to the war in Iraq and the punishment they would likely face if they returned to the US as grounds for asylum. The Immigration and Refugee Board had <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/decisions/public/hinzman/hinzman_e.htm">concluded</a> [decision text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/canada-denies-asylum-to-us-army-iraq.php">report</a>] that the two men would receive a fair trial if they were returned to the US and that they would not face persecution or cruel and unusual punishment. It is estimated that <a href="http://www.resisters.ca/resisters_stories.html">up to 200 former US military personnel are in Canada avoiding war service</a> [WRSC selected profiles] and that roughly 20 of them have applied for refugee status. In early July, Canada&#39;s House of Commons passed a non-binding resolution to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080603.wdeserters0603/BNStory/National">grant US military deserters asylum</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report].

Hogan</a> [official profile] nonetheless <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-378">said</a> [memorandum opinion, PDF] he granted the government&#39;s motion reluctantly, writing:<blockquote>Upon review of the public and ex parte declarations, the Court is satisfied that the government is not dragging its feet in an attempt to delay these matters beyond what is necessary to protect the national security concerns associated with releasing classified information. These cases are not run of the mill; they involve significant amounts of sensitive, classified information concerning individuals whom the government alleges were part of or supporting the Taliban or al Qaida or other organizations against which the United States is engaged in armed conflict. ... Going forward under the revised schedule resulting from the Court&#8217;s granting of its motion, consequently, the government cannot claim as a basis for failing to meet deadlines imposed by this Court that it &#39;simply did not appreciate the full extent of the challenges posed ...&#39;</blockquote> AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g7ypJNF1v_l-DVYtbMBcK8rmR9jg">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, Hogan called on the government to make the Guantanamo detention appeals a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-calls-for-speedy.php">top priority</a> [JURIST report] and devote all necessary resources to ensure that the appeals reach trial in a timely manner. Earlier in July, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-assigns-judges-to.php">court chose Hogan</a> [JURIST report] to preside over the habeas appeals, and Hogan will rule on procedural issues common to all cases. In June, Chief Justice Royce Lamberth of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-judge-discusses-guantanamo.php">held an off-the-record meeting</a> [JURIST report] with defense lawyers for Guantanamo detainees, reportedly discussing how the prisoners&#39; civil court challenges to their detentions might be affected by the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>]. In that decision the Supreme Court held that federal courts have jurisdiction to review <font style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</font> petitions filed by Guantanamo detainees who have been classified as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTMxNDAtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-3140-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl1ebd/3/hilite">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Monday that the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] must release certain photographs of alleged detainee abuse committed by US soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy websites] and other civil rights groups <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr%2C-et-al.-v.-dept.-defense-et-al.">sought the release</a> [CCR backgrounder] of the photographs under the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text], but the government had claimed that the photos were exempt from disclosure because their release would either invade the privacy of the detainees or insight retaliation against US forces abroad. The Second Circuit held that redactions of the photographs ordered by a lower court sufficiently protected the detainees&#39; privacy, and that safety exemptions to disclosure requirements were intended to cover reasonable safety risks to specific individuals rather than to any member of a larger group:<blockquote>We hold that in order to justify withholding documents... an agency must identify at least one individual with reasonable specificity and establish that disclosure of the documents could reasonably be expected to endanger that individual.  We need not shape the precise contours of the exemption today, as it is not a close question whether the government has identified any relevant individual with reasonable specificity.  It is plainly insufficient to claim that releasing documents could reasonably be expected to endanger some unspecified member of a group so vast as to encompass all United States troops, coalition forces, and civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The structure of FOIA and the applicable legislative history, both of which contemplate a far narrower role for [the exemption] than that envisioned by the defendants, amply confirm our holding.</blockquote>Governmental secrecy and the scope of the FOIA have been  issues of frequent disagreement between the US government and rights groups in recent years. In July, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit  <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Opinion%20(7-11-08).pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rejects-bush-appeal-of.php">report</a>] a Bush administration appeal against a <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Lamberth%2012%2017%2007%20Order%20to%20Produce%20Records.pdf">2007 order</a> [PDF text] requiring that White House visitor logs be released in under the FOIA. In June, the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="/pdf/wilner.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-rules-foia-does-not-apply.php">report</a>] that the FOIA does not require the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=nsa">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [JURIST news archive] to tell lawyers for Guantanamo Bay detainees whether it has used electronic surveillance methods to monitor their communications. Earlier this month, advocacy group <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/">OpenTheGovernment.org</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.openthegovernment.org/otg/SecrecyReportCard08.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-government-secrecy-continues-to-rise.php">report</a>] finding that  government secrecy continued to increase in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US-led <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/">Multi-National Force - Iraq</a> (MNF) [official website] announced Monday that it had released an Afghan freelance journalist detained since last year as an <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatant</a> [JURIST news archive]. A military spokesman said Jawed Ahmad, who had been working as a videographer for Canadian television network CTV, was freed Sunday because he was no longer considered a threat. Ahmad&#39;s family <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/afghan-journalist-files-lawsuit-against.php">sued the Bush administration</a> [JURIST report] in June, alleging his detention violated his rights to due process and counsel. Ahmad said in an <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080922.wafghanfixer22/BNStory/Afghanistan/home">interview</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] that he was subjected to beatings and sleep deprivation while in US custody. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hH8McyLeU8taecf63S3uGOg1DMBQD93BRNOG1">more</a>. Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gRH3SAIhPKoIVRwZ5feVxkeS29QQ">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Ahmad, also known as Javed Yazamy, was detained by coalition forces at a NATO airbase in Kandahar last October. US officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-military-designates-afghan.php">designated him an enemy combatant</a> [JURIST report] in February, alleging he had Taliban phone numbers and videos in his possession when he was detained. Ahmad is one of several journalists whom the US military has detained without charge in <a href="/countries/iraq.php">Iraq</a> and <a href="/countries/afghanistan.php">Afghanistan</a> [JURIST news archives]. In December 2006, the Committee to Protect Journalists released a <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/number-of-journalists-jailed-for.php">report</a> [JURIST report] noting that the US was detaining three journalists, including Al Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Haj and AP photographer Bilal Hussein.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers in <a href="/countries/nepal.php">Nepal</a> [JURIST news archive] began a boycott of court proceedings Sunday to protest the <a href="http://www.nepalnews.com/archive/2008/sep/sep18/news13.php">suspension</a> [Nepalnews.com report] of the national bar association&#39;s leader by the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov.np/">Nepalese Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The court last week suspended Bishwa Kanta Mainali, president of the <a href="http://www.nepalbar.org/">Nepal Bar Association</a> [profession website], for six months after he suggested that many Nepalese judges accept bribes. A bar association official said the boycott would continue until the court reverses the suspension, although some local media reported the boycott would end Tuesday. One Supreme Court justice has called the suspension &quot;erroneous,&quot; saying in an <a href="http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullstory.asp?filename=aFanata0sa3qzpla1Pa2a9a.axamal&folder=aHaoamW&Name=Home&dtSiteDate=20080921">interview</a> [<em>Himalayan Times report</em>] that the court should reconsider the decision after hearing from Mainali. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/22/asia/AS-Nepal-Lawyers-Protest.php">more</a>. Kantipur Online has <a href="http://www.kantipuronline.com/kolnews.php?&nid=161502">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Questions about the integrity of Nepal&#39;s judiciary have been raised before. Last year, the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> [advocacy website] urged Nepalese lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-group-urges-amendment-of-nepal.php">amend the country&#39;s interim constitution</a> [JURIST report] to create a fully independent judiciary. The Nepalese Supreme Court has also <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/nepal-high-court-wants-review-of.php">voiced concerns</a> [JURIST report] about judicial independence, pointing to a constitutional provision giving the prime minister sole discretion in appointing the chief justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Federal Reserve Board on Sunday <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080921a.htm">preliminarily approved</a> [press release] applications by independent investment banks <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/index.html">Morgan Stanley</a> [corporate websites] to convert to bank holding companies, which would put the banks under Federal Reserve regulation, grant them increased access to bank funds and allow them to build their deposit bases. The move will place both companies, which are now regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the tighter regulations of the FDIC and the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6000-100.html">Bank Holding Company Act</a> [text], effectively lowering the amount of debt the companies can risk in relation to the amount of money they actually have and requiring a higher amount of capital. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/press/press-releases/current/bank-holding-co.html">said</a> [press release] of the transition: <blockquote>When Goldman Sachs was a private partnership, we made the decision to become a public company, recognizing the need for permanent capital to meet the demands of scale. While accelerated by market sentiment, our decision to be regulated by the Federal Reserve is based on the recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding. We believe that Goldman Sachs, under Federal Reserve supervision, will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources.</blockquote> Meanwhile, officials from Morgan Stanley <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/about/press/articles/6933.html">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>The Firm does not expect significant adverse tax or accounting effects from this new status, nor does the Firm expect there to be limitations on its activities that would have a material impact on Morgan Stanley&#8217;s overall business.</blockquote> The Federal Reserve&#39;s approval will remain preliminary until the completion of a required five-day antitrust waiting period. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aoDmO_d0IJSU&refer=home">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7817093">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last week, members of the US Congress <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-congress-considers-legislative.php">spoke out</a> [JURIST report] about regulatory changes and investigations following a stock market drop propelled by <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/Business/1079224.html">Lehman Brothers&#39; Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and the sale of Merrill Lynch</a> [AP report]. Speaker of the House <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/">Rep. Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/Sept08/market.html">reiterated</a> [press release] plans for a new economic stimulus package designed to &quot;create jobs and address some of the most immediate consequences of the Administration&#8217;s serious mismanagement of our economy.&quot; Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Chris Dodd</a> (D-CT) [official website] <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/index.php?q=node/4552">said</a> [statement text] that the Banking Committee will continue to probe regulatory oversight and seek legislative solutions &quot;strengthening the housing sector, developing a second stimulus package, and restructuring the regulation of the financial sector.&#8221;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South African <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile; ANC <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/mbeki.html">profile</a>] insisted in an official  <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/showc.asp?type=sp&include=president/sp/2008/sp0921210.htm&ID=1795">resignation speech</a> [text] Sunday that allegations of his interference with the judiciary in the context of the Jacob Zuma case were incorrect.   Top ANC officials called for Mbeki&#39;s resignation Friday, and on Saturday Mbeki said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-president-resigning-after.php">he would resign</a> [JURIST report]. Mbeki said Sunday: <blockquote>I would like to restate the position of Cabinet on the inferences made by the Honourable Judge Chris Nicholson that the President and Cabinet have interfered in the work the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Again I would like to state this categorically that we have never done this, and therefore never compromised the right of the National Prosecuting Authority to decide whom it wished to prosecute or not to prosecute.<br /><br />This applies equally to the painful matter relating to the court proceedings against the President of the ANC, Comrade Jacob Zuma.<br /><br />More generally, I would like to assure the nation that our successive governments since 1994 have never acted in any manner intended wilfully to violate the Constitution and the law.</blockquote> ANC officials have <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=848601">moved for the resignation to be effective on Thursday</a> [Sapa report] and said that party deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe will <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jLHggDaNAug5JXOmUokNKWNaS8OQ">take over the presidency</a> [AFP report] until the 2009 elections. From South Africa, Sapa has <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2397212,00.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month Judge Chris Nicholson effectively <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the latest case against Mbeki&#39;s political rival and current <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [party website] leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> [JURIST news archive] on the grounds that Zuma had been deprived of the chance to respond to claims made against him and that &quot;political meddling&quot; in the case by Mbeki and others could not be excluded. Zuma has said that the charges against him were part of a politically motivated effort by Mbeki to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election.  He argued that he had both a constitutional and statutory right to state his case before charges were brought. Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

In an <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Memorandum%20Opinion_1.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF text] released Saturday, US <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1307">District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly</a> [official profile] of the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] wrote that it was &quot;unmistakably clear that Defendants apply a narrowing interpretation&quot; to the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries/laws/1978-act.html">Presidential Records Act of 1978</a> (PRA) [materials], which governs the official records of presidents and vice presidents. Calling the pleadings filed by Cheney&#39;s office &quot;bereft of any legal analysis,&quot; Kollary-Kotelly found that <blockquote>the public interest is undoubtedly served by ensuring that all documentary material potentially encompassed by the PRA&#39;s statutory language is actually preserved as Congress saw fit in enacting the PRA. ... These public interests are of the utmost significance and, as discussed above, are not and will not be fully protected if Defendants&#39; narrowed interpretation of the PRA&#39;s statutory language is incorrect as a matter of law. ... The American public, however, has a right to the preservation of all records encompassed by the PRA&#8217;s statutory language. As such, until the Court is able to determine whether Defendants&#8217; narrowed interpretation is legally supported, the public interest favors the issuance of a preliminary injunction. </blockquote>Cheney&#39;s office argued that the PRA encompasses only those vice presidential records that pertain to executive functions &quot;specially assigned&quot; by the president or to the vice president&#39;s functions as president of the Senate. The lawsuit was brought by <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW) [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/34213">praised the ruling</a> [press release] for &quot;reject[ing] the vice president&#39;s efforts to cloak his actions in a mantle of secrecy by declaring himself a fourth branch of government.&quot; Kollar-Kotelly has set an expedited schedule to allow &quot;full resolution&quot; of the issues before Cheney leaves office in January. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hKXn0zpu4g78bQXEplkbxWQy4euQD93AN5FO0">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/20/AR2008092001627.html?hpid=moreheadlines">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />This July, in another lawsuit filed by CREW, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rejects-bush-appeal-of.php">rejected a Bush administration appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a 2007 order requiring that White House visitor logs be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In June, CREW <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-seeking.php">appealed a decision</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge that the White House Office of Administration is not subject to the FOIA, even though it had complied with public records requests in the past. Cheney has previously asserted that his office is <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/22/nation/na-cheney22">not part of the executive branch</a> [<em>Los Angeles Times</em> report] of government. Last year, the US House Oversight Committee released documents showing that Cheney had <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/cheney-ignoring-executive-order-on.php">exempted his office</a> [JURIST report] from an executive order requiring executive branch officials to submit annual reports to ensure that classified information is properly secured. In 2006, the US Justice Department <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/bush-administration-appeals-cheney.php">appealed</a> a federal judge&#39;s decision ordering the Secret Service to <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-orders-cheney-visitor.php">release visitor logs</a> [JURIST reports] for Cheney&#39;s office and personal residence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=204">Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar</a> [official profile] swore in four previously ousted judges as new members of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Saturday, bringing the number of the judges on the reconstituted court to 29. Justice Sardar Mohammad Raza Khan and Justice Nasirul Mulk were members of the top court when they were effectively dismissed in November last year under former President Pervez Musharraf&#39;s proclamation of emergency. Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed and Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany were previously members of the Sindh High Court and were ousted from their positions by the same measure. Given existing rules of seniority, Khan will succeed Dogar when the latter is required to leave office on March 21, 2009. In the wake of this latest reinstatement, only six of the pre-emergency Supreme Court justices remain unrestored, most notable among the former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. After Saturday&#39;s reinstatements Law Minister Farooq H. Naek reiterated that under the Pakistan Constitution, only one Chief Justice could sit at any one time. The current Pakistan People&#39;s Party government has made no move to replace Dogar. From Pakistan, <em>Dawn</em> has <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/21/top6.htm">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Three other judges ousted from the Pakistani Supreme Court were <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/three-judges-reappointed-to-pakistan.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Critics of the government have described the piecemeal <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-authorities-reinstate-4-more.php">reinstatements</a> [JURIST report] as evidence of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to undermine support for total reinstatement. Last week lawyers in Islamabad and other centers <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawyers-seeking-full-judicial.php">boycotted legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] and held protests calling for the restoration of all judges ousted by Musharraf last November.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv1090-70">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the civil rights of former Army Special Forces officer <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/transgender/12255res20050602.html">Diane Schroer</a> [profile] were violated after a job offer to serve as the senior terrorism research analyst at the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> [official website] was rescinded following Schroer&#39;s disclosure to her future supervisor that she was undergoing a gender transformation. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/transgender/12256prs20050602.html">filed</a> [ACLU news release] a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/schroer_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/transgender/12255res20050602.html">materials</a>] on behalf of Schroer in June 2005 under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text; EEOC <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/qanda.html">backgrounder</a>], claiming the Library of Congress made it clear they thought Schroer was the best person for the job in extending the offer, but immediately changed its mind after Schroer voluntarily disclosed her intent to undergo a sex change operation. The complaint also argued that Schroer&#39;s right to due process and equal protection rights were violated. The Library of Congress countered that federal anti-discrimination laws do not extend to transgender people. The judge found &quot;compelling evidence&quot; that the hiring decision was &quot;infected by sex stereotypes,&quot; and concluded:<blockquote>it is not necessary to draw sweeping conclusions about the reach of Title VII. Even if the decisions that define the word &#8220;sex&#8221; in Title VII as referring only to anatomical or chromosomal sex are still good law...the Library&#8217;s refusal to hire Schroer after being advised that she planned to change her anatomical sex by undergoing sex reassignment surgery was literally discrimination &#8220;because of . . . sex.&#8221;</blockquote>CNN has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/09/19/transsexual.discrimination/index.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The ruling comes as a major victory for transgender people claiming employment discrimination. In October, an employment non-discrimination bill protecting gays, lesbians, and bisexuals but not transgendered individuals was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/house-bill-to-protect-gay-workers.php">sent to the full US House of Representatives </a>[JURIST report]. The absence of transgender protections prompted <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt/discrim/32233prs20071018.html">sharp opposition</a> [ACLU press release] to the measure from civil rights groups, but Democrats who had introduced the bill were worried that the inclusion of language applying to transgender employees would cause the bill to fail. They vowed to address the issue in the future. Currently less than half of US states specifically prohibit <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sexual+orientation+discrimination">discrimination based on sexual orientation</a> [JURIST news archive], and only half of these laws include protection for transgender individuals. Last year Maryland passed a transgender anti-discrimination law, but its implementation was suspended when opponents of the measure gathered signatures on a referendum petition. The matter was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/maryland-transgender-anti.php">set to go to voters in November</a> [JURIST report], but the Maryland Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090901472.html">ruled this month</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] that the petition did not fulfill the legal requirements to put the question on the ballot.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Venezuelan government ordered two senior officials of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] to leave the country Thursday night after the group <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/18/venezu19844.htm">released a report</a> [press release] concluding that democracy and human rights have suffered during the presidency of <a href="http://www.gobiernoenlinea.gob.ve/venezuela/ejecutivo.html">Hugo Chavez</a> [official profile, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">profile</a>]. According to a <a href="http://www.mre.gov.ve/Noticias/A2008/comunic-262.htm">statement</a> [text, in Spanish] from Venezuela&#39;s <a href="http://www.mre.gov.ve/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Spanish], HRW Americas director <a href="http://memoria.fiu.edu/memoria/taskforce.htm#josemiguelvivanco_es">Jose Miguel Vivanco</a> [profile] and deputy director Daniel Wilkinson were expelled because they had &quot;attacked the institutions of Venezuelan democracy&quot; and &quot;illegally interfered in the internal affairs of our country.&quot; Escorted by armed soldiers, the men were flown to Brazil, where Vivanco told the <em>New York Times</em> in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/world/americas/20venez.html?ref=world">interview</a> [report] that the expulsion &quot;reveals yet again the degree of intolerance of this government.&quot; The 230-page HRW <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/venezuela0908/">report</a> [text] stated that &quot;[d]iscrimination on political grounds has been a defining feature of the Ch&aacute;vez presidency.&quot; The <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/venezuela0908/1.htm#_Toc207173120">executive summary</a> [text] of the report concluded: <blockquote>A country&#39;s citizens cannot participate fully and equally in its politics when their rights to freedom of expression and association are at risk. Ensuring these essential rights requires more than constitutional guarantees and political rhetoric. It requires institutions that are capable of countering and curbing abusive state practices. Above all, it requires a judiciary that is independent, competent, and credible. It is also critical that non-state institutions - such as the media, organized labor, and civil society - are free from government reprisals and political discrimination.<br /><br />President Ch&aacute;vez has actively sought to project himself as a champion of democracy, not only in Venezuela, but throughout Latin America. Yet his professed commitment to this cause is belied by his government&#39;s willful disregard for the institutional guarantees and fundamental rights that make democratic participation possible. Venezuela will not achieve real and sustained progress toward strengthening its democracy&#8212;nor will it serve as a useful model for other countries in the region&#8212;so long as its government continues to flout the human rights principles enshrined in its own constitution. </blockquote> The <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gov.ve/">Venezuelan National Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] reacted to the report in a <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20104&Itemid=59">pronouncement</a> [text] calling it part of a &quot;smear campaign&quot; promoted by the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] with the purpose fomenting a coup.

US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack <a href="http://caracas.usembassy.gov/?d=5597">said</a> [statement] the expulsions reflected &quot;the weakness and desperation of these leaders as they face serious internal challenges and an inability to communicate effectively internationally.&quot; Opponents have accused Chavez of pushing increasingly autocratic reforms, including <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-opposition-criticizes.php">constitutional changes</a> [JURIST report] that would eliminate presidential term limits and augment the president&#39;s emergency powers. Chavez said the constitutional changes were necessary to advance a socialist revolution in <a href="/countries/venezuela.php">Venezuela</a> [JURIST news archive], but HRW warned that they would <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/16/venezu17104.htm">violate international law</a> [press release] by allowing the president to suspend due process guarantees during times of emergency. In <a href="/countries/bolivia.php">Bolivia</a> [JURIST news archive] recently, Morales has faced regional protests in affluent states opposing his income redistribution proposals.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy website] on Thursday filed a <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/jewel/jewel.complaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; EFF <a href="http://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/09/17-0">press release</a>] seeking injunctive, declaratory and equitable relief from the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/home_html.cfm">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [agency website] <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive], which gave government agencies access to over 300 terabytes of data concerning communication sent and received by <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=3309">AT&amp;T</a> [corporate website] customers.  Filed on behalf of those customers, the suit names as defendants the US government, the NSA, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">President George W. Bush</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/vicepresident/">Vice President Dick Cheney</a> [official profile], and several other officials. EFF alleges violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">news archive</a>], and federal electronic surveillance law. The complaint also argues that the surveillance program violated the <a href="http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/courses/study_aids/adlaw/">Federal Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text] because it exceeded Congressionally-mandated limitations established by FISA, and alleges that it violates the Constitutional separation of powers principle <blockquote>because it was authorized by the Executive in excess of the Executive&#8217;s authority under Article II of the United States Constitution ... and exceeds the statutory limits imposed on the Executive by Congress.</blockquote>  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/washington/19nsa.html?ref=us">more</a>.<br /><br />The lawsuit filed Thursday follows an <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/e-privacy-group-sues-att-for-opening.php">earlier class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by EFF against AT&amp;T in January 2006 over the company&#39;s participation in the warrantless surveillance program. The most recent lawsuit is aimed at the US government, reflecting the July amendment to FISA which granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies participating in the surveillance program. The amendment was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080710-2.html">signed into law</a> [White House press release] by President Bush on July 10, after the US Senate voted <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00168">69-28</a> [roll call; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senate-rejects-bid-to-deny-immunity-for.php">report</a>] to approve the amendment. Earlier that day, the Senate rejected three proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080708-7.html">amendments</a> [WH fact sheet] to the bill that would have limited the immunity. In June, the US House of Representatives <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml">passed</a> [roll call] HR 6304, amending FISA and including the granting of retroactive immunity. The bill also grants the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/patriot_foia/2003/court_rules.pdf">FISA court</a> [governing provisions] authority to review a wider range of wiretapping orders, would prohibit the executive branch from overriding the court&#39;s authority, and orders the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] and other agencies to issue a report on the country&#39;s use of wiretapping orders.

He has been in court custody since his arrest, and the court has <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/eccc-denies-khmer-rouge-second-in.php">rejected</a> his lawyers&#39; attempts to have him <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/khmer-rouge-second-in-command-appeals.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] until trial.

The ECCC has said it <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">plans to try as many as eight suspects</a> [JURIST report] on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their roles in the Khmer Rouge regime, which is generally held responsible for the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">genocide of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] who died between 1975 and 1979.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  New York <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/home.html">Attorney General Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] Thursday said his department is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/18/AR2008091801953.html">conducting an investigation</a> [AP report] into whether some investors used illegal methods to profit from recent declines in banking and insurance stocks. It is alleged that some investors combined the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/shortselling/shortselling1.asp">short-selling</a> [Forbes backgrounder] of stock with the spreading of false information to illegally gain from recent devaluations in <a href="http://www.lehman.com/">Lehman Brothers</a>, <a href="http://www.aig.com/">AIG</a> [corporate websites] and other stocks.  Cuomo said his office will prosecute those found to have intentionally contributed to the declines under a <a href="http://www.wlf.org/upload/022803LBMctamaney.pdf">New York law</a> [Martin Act backgrounder, PDF], which gives him broad authority to investigate financial crimes. On Friday, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) implemented a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-204.htm">temporary ban</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2008/34-58572.pdf">revised rules</a>, PDF] on certain kinds of short-selling of key financial stocks in an attempt to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/business/20sec.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">stabilize their values</a> [NYT report]. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aaNMUbYB8VC8&refer=home">more</a>.<br /><br />In an effort to better detect other kinds of financial fraud, including <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=insider+trading">insider trading</a> [JURIST news archive], in August the SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-174.htm">announced</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-stock-exchanges-agree-to-centralize.php">report</a>] that it had reached a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2008/34-58350.pdf">tentative agreement</a> [PDF text] with ten US stock exchanges to centralize insider trading controls among the institutions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-crt-849.html">announced</a> [press release] that it would not post criminal prosecutors at the polls for the November 4 presidential election, responding to concerns raised by civil rights groups. The decision represents a departure from the DOJ&#39;s longstanding practice. <a href="http://www.icasinc.org/bios/becker_g.html">Grace Chung Becker</a> [profile], assistant attorney general for the DOJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/">Civil Rights Division</a> [official website], issued the following statement: <blockquote>On Election Day, the primary responsibility of the Civil Rights Division is to ensure all eligible voters are able to cast their ballot in an environment free of discrimination, suppression or intimidation. The Division has and will use every statute within its purview to provide all voters with a free and fair electoral process.<br /><br />On November 4, 2008, hundreds of federal government employees will be deployed in counties, cities and towns across the country to monitor polling places and to ensure compliance with federal voting statutes. In light of questions we have been asked regarding who will serve as election monitors, I want to inform the public that no criminal prosecutors will be utilized as election monitors on Election Day this year. This decision was made as a precaution and is not the result of any instance of intimidation or complaint regarding any specific incident. </blockquote>Civil rights advocates have criticized what they perceive as the DOJ&#39;s emphasis on <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122091910197012647.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">preventing voter fraud</a> [<em>Wall Street Journal</em> report] rather than ensuring minority access to the polls, questioning whether the presence of prosecutors <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94386318">intimidates minorities</a> [NPR report] in some communities. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hYbyoBY23xK4yZjEp2AyFMXZ4cSAD93CMCB85">more</a>.<br /><br />During a Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3535">oversight hearing</a> [materials] earlier this month, Becker <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/08-09-09Grace_Becker_Testimony.pdf">testified</a> [prepared remarks, PDF] that elections monitors are &quot;among the most effective means of ensuring that federal voting rights are respected on election day.&quot; She reported that this year, 364 federal observers and 148 other DOJ personnel have monitored 47 elections in 43 jurisdictions. In July, Attorney General Michael Mukasey told the House Judiciary Committee during a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-presents-priorities-for.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] that enforcing voting rights would be a priority for the remainder of his tenure. The <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1971.html">Voting Rights Act</a> [text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm">backgrounder</a>] authorizes federal courts and the attorney general to appoint <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/examine/activ_exam.htm#monitoring">federal observers</a> [DOJ backgrounder] to monitor elections for voting-rights violations.

According to an Interior Ministry statement, <blockquote>In Ms Holmlund&#39;s view, it is important that the licence procedure in Kauhajoki will be investigated by a prosecutor. Only this way can we ascertain whether the instructions and regulations have been followed and whether the police have had information on such matters in the light of which the licence should not have been granted in the first place or the validity period should not have been extended. </blockquote>After Tuesday&#39;s shootings, <a href="http://www.vnk.fi/etusivu/en.jsp">Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen</a> [official website] said the government would <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGJMd71ugtSNgSqJF0u97Se2oNGAD93CVG383">consider stronger gun control laws</a> [AP report].

Later that month, European Union (EU) lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/eu-lawmakers-seek-tougher-gun-control.php">endorsed a legislative report</a> [JURIST report] to tighten gun control laws and establish an extensive firearms database.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] traveled to New York Monday to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/424.html">seek support</a> [press release] from members of the United Nations and the African Union for the arrest of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>], as the UN General Assembly opened its 63rd annual session Tuesday. Moreno-Ocampo has faced criticism from <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-arrest-of-sudan-leader-could.php">international leaders</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">organizations</a> [JURIST reports] for his July <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">application for a warrant to arrest Bashir</a> [JURIST report] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes for atrocities committed in Darfur. On Monday, the Organization of the Islamic Conference <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/22/news/UN-UN-General-Assembly-Sudan.php">joined calls</a> [IHT report] for the ICC to delay any prosecution until peace negotiations with Sudan have been exhausted. The UN Security Council (UNSC) has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_120704-EN.pdf">authority</a> [Rome Statute Article 16 text, PDF; HRW <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/15/sudan19626.htm">backgrounder</a>] to <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iR66A1Bh9FY2_oEwqa9g-ecw401Q">suspend ICC prosecution for one year,</a> [AFP report] if the move is backed by a majority vote and a consensus among its five permanent members. Last week, France - a UNSC permanent member - suggested that such <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j35JbovX5UjcS6pdfgtZVz78kjag">suspension may be appropriate as a &quot;gesture&quot;</a> [AFP report] to encourage more Sudanese cooperation in peacekeeping efforts. <br /><br />In August, Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">threatened to ignore</a> any ICC-issued arrest warrant, saying he would not &quot;deal with or respond to&quot; the ICC. Moreno-Ocampo has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">criticized Sudan&#39;s own investigation</a> [JURIST reports] of war crimes in Darfur, calling it &quot;part of the cover-up.&quot; Sudan&#39;s justice minister recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">appointed several prosecutors</a> to locally investigate and try war crimes suspects in <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">internationally monitored courts</a> [JURIST reports]. Criticism of Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s warrant application from the African Union (AU) and <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic], among others, stems from the belief that the move threatens to destabilize the region and poses a risk to joint AU-UN peacekeeping forces in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Congress passed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6983eh.txt.pdf">legislation</a> [H.R. 6983 text, PDF] Tuesday to reduce inequities in the insurance coverage of mental health and addiction treatment, bringing the insurance costs for such treatment in line with those of conventional medical procedures. The bill, known as the &quot;Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008,&quot; and often referred to as mental health parity legislation, passed in the Senate as part of a tax amendment bill by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00205">93-2</a> [H.R. 6049 roll call vote] and in the House of Representatives by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll625.xml">376-47</a> [roll call vote]. The bill now heads to a joint committee for arrangement in a final form to be presented to President George W. Bush for signature. The legislation amends the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/usc_sup_01_29_10_18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974</a> (ERISA) [text] to provide that insurance and group health care plans that provide both medical and surgical benefits as well as mental health or substance abuse benefits ensure that:<blockquote>the financial requirements applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage), and there are no separate cost sharing requirements that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits; and ... the treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage) and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</blockquote> Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE48N0FY20080924?sp=true">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092302882.html?hpid=sec-health">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Passage of the mental health parity act, named in part after the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, drew praise from both advocacy and industry groups, including the <a href="http://www.nami.org/Hometemplate.cfm">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Policy_News_and_Alerts&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=67254">press release</a>], the <a href="http://www.apha.org/">American Public Health Association</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.apha.org/about/news/pressreleases/2008/Mental_health_parity_bill.htm">press release</a>] and <a href="http://www.ahip.org/">America&#39;s Health Insurance Plans</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.ahip.org/content/pressrelease.aspx?docid=24555">press release</a>], an insurance industry trade group. The <a href="http://www.psych.org/">American Psychiatric Association</a> (APA) [advocacy website] also <a href="http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/AdvocacyGovernmentRelations/GovernmentRelations/MentalHealthParityUpdate.aspx">commented</a> [press release, DOC] on the passage of the bill, expressing concern over final approval of the legislation and payment for the costs of the act.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Tuesday entered a not guilty plea and ordered a psychiatric evaluation in the trial of <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/siddiqui.htm">Aafia Siddiqui</a> [FBI materials], a Pakistani woman with alleged ties to al Qaeda. Siddiqui was <a href="http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/US_v_AafiaSiddiqui_complaint.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistani-woman-alleged-to-be-al-qaeda.php">report</a>] in August with assault and the attempted murder of a US officer after allegedly opening fire on agents at the Afghan detention facility where she was being held in July. Judge Richard Berman entered the not guilty plea on her behalf as Siddiqui did not attend her arraignment after refusing to undergo a mandatory strip search. <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/">US Attorney Michael Garcia</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE48MBHS20080923">requested the psychiatric evaluation</a> [Reuters report] Monday on suspicions that Siddiqui is mentally unfit to stand trial, with defense attorney Elizabeth Fink agreeing that such evaluation is appropriate. A December 17 hearing will determine Siddiqui&#39;s mental competence, with a tentative trial date set for March 9. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iob0CmpW16LAl8PgaH3u3hiOGLgwD93CO9O81">more</a>. <br /><br />Siddiqui, who was extradited to the US in August, was shot in the abdomen during the July skirmish leading to her charges. She has since refused proper medical care as well as communication with her legal counsel. Siddiqui&#39;s family has insisted that she is not an al-Qaeda agent and that the FBI has publicized misleading information about her. They say that Siddiqui, a former student at Brandeis University and MIT in Boston, may have been a victim of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] after she vanished from Karachi, Pakistan in 2003. Defense lawyers have alleged that Siddiqui may have been wrongly detained and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/04/AR2008090402245.html">tortured</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> report] at Bagram air base in Afghanistan.

The <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">indictment</a> [text] in question was issued in 2000, and contains 11 charges against Karadzic, including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation and &quot;other inhumane acts.&quot;  If granted, the motion would cause several significant changes, such as dropping allegations that Karadzic breached the Geneva Convention and was complicit in genocide, reducing the number of alleged municipalities in which Karadzic committed criminal activity, and bifurcating the genocide charge to create one count for his alleged involvement in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and another count for his alleged role in the killing of Bosnian Muslims and Croats during <a href="http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr90/fbosnia1992.htm">ethnic conflicts</a> [timeline] in the former Yugoslavia during the early 1990s.  Amending the indictment would mean calling fewer witnesses to testify, and prosecutors hope it will simplify the trial process. <br /><br />Last week, Karadzic reiterated his desire to represent himself, as well as his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-asks-tribunal-to-order.php">claim</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS profile], former US ambassador to the UN, had promised him immunity conditioned upon removing himself from public life.  Karadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years.  He was originally indicted in 1995 but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report].  He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">repeatedly refused</a> to enter a plea on the charges, with an ICTY judge eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-again-refuses-to-enter-pleas.php">entering a not-guilty plea</a> [JURIST reports] on his behalf.  If the court approves the amended indictment, Karadzic will be asked to enter new pleas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> [official website] is currently investigating <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml">Fannie Mae</a>, <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.lehman.com/">Lehman Brothers</a>, and <a href="http://www.aig.com/Home-Page_20_17084.html">AIG</a> [corporate websites] along with 22 other financial institutions for possible <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/mortgage_fraud.htm">mortgage fraud</a> [FBI backgrounder], US media outlets reported Tuesday. The investigations follow a market collapse that led to a Bush administration <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1150.htm">proposal</a> [fact sheet; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senate-democrats-fault-lack-of-judicial.php">report</a>] circulated over the weekend that would authorize the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/">Treasury Department</a> to acquire as much as $700 billion in mortgages and other loans. Though FBI officials would not comment on which firms are involved in the ongoing inquiries, ABC News <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5871255">reported</a> [text] that FBI spokesman Richard Kolko has confirmed 26 &quot;pending corporate fraud investigations involving subprime lenders.&quot; AP <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-wed-bailout-fbisep24,0,5685742.story">reported</a> [text] that the investigations are in the &quot;early stages.&quot; The <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122221103979869021.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">more</a>.<br /><br />In June, the FBI announced that <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mortgagefraud061908.htm">more than 400 people had been indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/fbi-names-more-than-400-in-mortgage.php">report</a>] in connection to what has been termed the US &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot; The vast majority of the indictments involved fraud related to individual mortgages, with the FBI focusing on lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes, which account for more than $1 billion in losses. Earlier month, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/07/news/companies/fannie_freddie/index.htm?postversion=2008090711">placed into a conservatorship</a> under the Federal Housing Finance Agency [CNN report], investment bank Lehman Brothers <a href="http://thechronicleherald.ca/Business/1079224.html">filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> [AP report], and the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/americasMergersNews/idUSN2452330820080924">Federal Reserve took control of nearly 80% of the shares</a> [Reuters report] of leading insurer AIG. <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-york-ag-to-investigate-allegations.php">New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has also announced a state investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether some investors used illegal methods to profit from the recent declines in banking and insurance stocks, possibly by <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/shortselling/shortselling1.asp">short-selling</a> [Forbes backgrounder] stock and spreading of false information to illegally gain from the devaluations in Lehman Brothers, AIG and other stocks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=kohlmann">Marine Col. Ralph Kohlmann</a> [JURIST news archive], chief judge of US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commissions</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness">news archive</a>], said Tuesday at a pretrial hearing for five suspects in the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] that he is scheduled to retire next April. During <em>voir dire</em>, in which defense attorneys questioned Kohlmann about potential bias, the judge said he had submitted retirement paperwork this past February. Kohlmann refused to speculate about whether the trials would conclude before his retirement, telling the attorneys he would reassign the cases if necessary. Among the suspects who appeared before Kohlmann on Tuesday was <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheik+Mohammed">Khalid Sheik Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive], suspected of coordinating the 9/11 attacks, who <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZXxZ9jWlnYZ5G_1_W_-FG8F2vHwD93CNMF80">asked Kohlmann</a> [AP report] about his religious affiliation and his ability to preside impartially as a military officer. The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/breaking-news/story/698448.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Kohlmann has served as chief judge of the military commissions since last year. After his appointment, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/13/us/13gitmo.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1222265668-AMO0Tnj+7cPI5hgJuIZ+9Q">noted</a> [report] that Kohlmann had criticized the concept of military commissions in a <a href="http://www.uniset.ca/misc/kohlmann.html">paper</a> [text] he had written in 2002 as a master&#39;s student at the US <a href="http://www.nwc.navy.mil/">Naval War College</a> [official website]. Kohlmann wrote that US district courts would be a better venue for terrorism suspects&#39; trials because of a perception that military commissions lack independence and credibility. In another recent personnel change at the military commissions, US <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile; JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/controversial-guantanamo-legal-advisor.php">reassigned</a> [JURIST report] to the newly-created position of director of operations of the Office of Military Commissions. In his former position as legal advisor to the military commissions, Hartmann had been barred from taking part in certain detainees&#39; trials on grounds that he was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khadr-military-judge-bars-brigadier.php">biased toward the prosecution</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Serbia submitted a draft resolution to the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] Tuesday seeking an <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] advisory opinion on the legality of the unilaterally-proclaimed independence of <a href="/countries/kosovo.php">Kosovo</a> [JURIST news archive]. The draft resolution was presented following an address to the General Assembly by <a href="http://www.predsednik.yu/mwc/default.asp?c=101000&g=20060904141200&lng=eng&hs1=0">Serbian President Boris Tadic</a> [official website; JURIST news archive]. The draft resolution and Tadic&#39;s address follow a letter to UN members from Tadic sent two weeks ago urging support for the Serbian ICJ advisory opinion request. In Tuesday&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/63/generaldebate/pdf/serbia_en.pdf">address</a> [text, PDF], Tadic said:<blockquote>Your vote in support of this resolution would serve to reaffirm another key international principle at stake: the right of any member State of the United Nations to pose a simple, elementary question - on a matter it considers vitally important - to the competent court. To vote against is in effect to vote to deny the right of any country&#8212;now or in the future&#8212;to seek judicial recourse through the UN system. To vote against means to accept that nothing could be done when secessionists in whichever part of the world proclaim the uniqueness of their cause, and claim exception to the universal scope of international law. Such an attitude could lead to the end of the UN system as we know it.</blockquote> The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28183&Cr=general+assembly&Cr1=debate">more</a>. <br /><br />Kosovo&#39;s <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect this summer</a> [JURIST report] despite Serbia&#39;s argument that the charter of the breakaway province was legally void.  Serbia does not recognize Kosovo&#39;s <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/?krye=news&newsid=1635&lang=en">declaration of independence</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">report</a>], and thus cannot recognize the country&#39;s constitution as a legal fact.  Serbia&#39;s official stance is that Kosovo is in violation of the UN Charter and <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=S/RES/1244%20(1999)&Lang=E&Area=UNDOC">UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> [PDF text], which reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Serbian state. The new state of Kosovo has been recognized by the US and most European states, but not by Russia, Serbia&#39;s closest ally.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will amend <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">proposed investigation guidelines</a> [JURIST report] to comport with the concerns of Congress and civil liberties groups, according to testimony by <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/olp-assistant-ag.htm">Assistant Attorney General Elisebeth Cook</a> [official profile] given Tuesday before the US <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/index.html">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [committee website]. The proposed rules, referred to as the Attorney General Guidelines, are intended to shift the focus of the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] from fighting crime to preventing terrorism in the US.  In a <a href="http://intelligence.senate.gov/080923/cook-caproni.pdf">joint written statement</a> [text, PDF] with FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/caproni.htm">General Counsel Valerie Caproni</a> [official profile], Cook wrote:<blockquote>Over the last seven years, the FBI has altered its organizational structure, and the Attorney General has issued new policies to guide the FBI as it seeks to protect the United States and its people from terrorism, intelligence threats, and crime, while continuing to protect the civil liberties and privacy of it citizens. The changes reflected in the new guidelines are necessary in order for the FBI to continue its important transformation to being an intelligence-driven organization. We believe that using intelligence as the strategic driver for the FBI&#8217;s activities will improve its ability to carry out its national security, criminal law enforcement, and foreign intelligence missions.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g07mkwmsp4l_Q5H-YBiHq6phbimgD93CM50G0">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/director.htm">FBI Director Robert Mueller</a> [official profile] defended the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-director-defends-proposed.php">proposed guidelines</a> [JURIST report] before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] as a &quot;necessary step&quot; in fighting terrorism. Opponents have <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/senate-judiciary-committee-calls-for.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the changes could allow inappropriate racial and ethnic profiling and would permit agents to open terror investigations without evidence of any crime having been committed. Committee Chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] and the committee&#39;s ranking Republican, Arlen Specter (R-PA), <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/issues/Judiciary/081808MukaseyReGuidelines.pdf">wrote</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200808/081808a.html">press release</a>] to Attorney General Michael Mukasey last month, calling on him to postpone implementation of the guidelines pending Congressional review. In his own <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-defends-fbi-and-doj-procedures.php">testimony</a> [JURIST report] before the committee in July, Mukasey said the guidelines would take into account not only race or religion but also factors such as travel to foreign terror &quot;hot spots.&quot; Wednesday&#39;s Senate hearing followed another <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_090916.html">oversight hearing</a> [materials] Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee, where Mueller said the federal government would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-director-anticipates-independent.php">commission an independent review</a> [JURIST report] of the FBI&#39;s use of scientific evidence in its investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An <font style="font-style:italic;">en-banc</font> panel of the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/06-1562.pdf">clarified</a> [decision, PDF] the test to be used to determine whether a <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/design/index.html#def">design patent</a> [government backgrounder] has been infringed. The issue came before the court in a dispute over an alleged infringement of <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2FD467389">US Design Patent No. 467,389</a> [patent materials], a design for a four-sided nail buffer, in which a <a href="http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/06opinions/06-1562.pdf">three-member panel</a> [opinion, PDF] of the court had found no violation. The court had originally denied the claim because it found that the allegedly infringing design did not include a non-trivial &quot;point of novelty.&quot;  In the rehearing, the court again found no infringement, but broadly rejected the widely-used &quot;point of novelty&quot; test. Instead, the court held that an &quot;ordinary observer test&quot; designed to include relevant knowledge of design trends in a particular field was a better application of legal precedent:<blockquote>We think, however, that...predecessor cases...are more properly read as applying a version of the ordinary observer test in which the ordinary observer is deemed to view the differences between the patented design and the accused product in the context of the prior art.  When the differences between the claimed and accused design are viewed in light of the prior art, the attention of the hypothetical ordinary observer will be drawn to those aspects of the claimed design that differ from the prior art.  And when the claimed design is close to the prior art designs, small differences between the accused design and the claimed design are likely to be important to the eye of the hypothetical ordinary observer. </blockquote> Patently-O has <a href="http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2008/09/en-banc-federal.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1295.html">28 U.S.C &sect; 1295</a> [text], Federal Circuit Court decisions on patent issues can only be reversed by the US Supreme Court. In June, the Supreme Court&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-937.ZO.html">ruled</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-false-claims-act.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/quavlge">Quanta v. LG</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>] that a patent holder&#39;s rights may be exhausted through certain license agreements. In that case, brought by <a href="http://www.lge.com/">LG Electronics</a> against <a href="http://www.quanta.com.tw/Quanta/english/Default.aspx">Quanta Computer</a> [corporate websites] for the allegedly wrongful use of patented computer components, the court overturned a July 2006 US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/05-1261.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] based largely on the disputed <a href="http://www.buildingipvalue.com/07US_Can/p.127-130%20Sutherland.pdf">doctrine of equivalents</a> [backgrounder, PDF].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/092308pzr.pdf">stayed the execution</a> [order, PDF] of Georgia death row inmate Troy Anthony Davis &quot;pending the disposition of the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari</em>.&quot;  Davis had been <a href="http://law.ga.gov/00/press/detail/0,2668,87670814_87670929_121231342,00.html">scheduled to be executed</a> [AG news release] at 7 PM EDT on Tuesday.  According to his lawyers, key witnesses who claimed they saw Davis kill an off-duty police officer in 1989 have recanted their testimony and others say another person has since confessed to the killing.  A stay will terminate automatically if Davis&#39;s petition for <em>certiorari</em> is denied.  The US Supreme Court had previously denied a petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the case, and the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] in March <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/docket_search/results_one_record.php?docr_case_num=S07A1758">denied</a> [court docket; <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/op_summaries/mar_17.pdf">opinion summary</a>] Davis&#39;s request for a new trial.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jhQApEoEL-uLsrCXRQzPN5FmpNXgD93CMID00">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span> has <a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2008/09/23/davis_stay_execution.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Davis would have been the third prisoner in Georgia to be executed since September 2007, after <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/georgia-conducts-first-execution-since.php">resuming executions in May</a> following an <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">effective moratorium</a> [JURIST reports] on the death penalty in the United States as many federal courts, state courts, and state governors put executions on hold pending the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/bazvree">Baze v.

The Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-5439.pdf">upheld the procedure</a> [opinion, PDF] in April.

De Lima said that in an effort to end the mistreatment, her office has tried to plan unscheduled visits to prisoners suspected of being tortured, but last week was denied access to three military prisoners.  In response to the lack of access and prevalence of abuse, De Lima sent a letter to <a href="http://www.afp.mil.ph/ghq/csafp/index.htm">General Alexander Yano</a> [official profile] demanding access to military detention facilities under the CHRP&#39;s <a href="http://www.chr.gov.ph/MAIN%20PAGES/about%20us/01consti_creation.htm">constitutional mandate</a> [text], and has urged lawmakers to ratify the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/english/notpubl/iv_9be.pdf">Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention Against Torture</a> (OPCAT)[PDF text]. The <a href="http://www.senate.gov.ph/">Senate of the Philippines</a> [official website] was expected to ratify the protocol, which would establish stronger monitoring standards, later this year, but on Tuesday <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/profiles_eermita.asp">Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita</a> [official profile] said the government would likely seek to <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/122353/RP-seeks-5-year-exemption-from-anti-torture-protocol">defer the implementation of OPCAT</a> [GMANews report] for at least three years in order to ensure compliance with the agreement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Myanmar state media outlets announced Tuesday that the state&#39;s ruling junta released 9,002 prisoners for good behavior, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7631395.stm">U Win Tin</a> [BBC report; AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA16/016/2008/en/ae06b928-49e4-11dd-9394-c975c4bd488d/asa160162008eng.html">backgrounder</a>], a founder of Myanmar opposition group the National League for Democracy (NLD) and the state&#39;s longest-incarcerated political prisoner. Officials for the state newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">New Light of Myanmar</span> wrote: <blockquote>The government terminated the prison terms of 9,002 prisoners with good conduct and discipline for social consideration of their families and released from the respective jails on 23 September 2008 to enable them to serve the interests of the regions and their own and the fair election to be held in 2010 together with the people after realizing the government&#39;s loving kindness and goodwill.</blockquote> The release follows last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/myanmar-activists-sentenced-to-prison.php">imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] of five NLD protesters, and NLD officials have questioned how many of the 9,002 released are political prisoners. Amnesty International (AI) <a href="http://www.amnesty.nl/voor_de_pers_artikel/37949">applauded the release</a> [press release], stating that at least seven political prisoners were released, but also noted that the status of the remaining 2,100 was still unknown.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US district judge in enjoined the Dallas suburb of <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/">Farmers Branch</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=farmers+branch">news archive</a>] on Monday from enforcing an <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/Communication/Ordinance%20No%202952.doc">ordinance</a> [DOC text] that prohibits illegal immigrants from occupying leased property. <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judges/boyle.html">US District Judge Jane J. Boyle</a> of the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/">Northern District of Texas</a> [official websites] issued a preliminary injunction, replacing a <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-fbtro_13met.ART0.State.Edition1.26a273d.html">temporary restraining order</a> [<em>Dallas Morning News</em> report] entered earlier this month, as she set an expedited schedule that would bring the case to trial by early December. A spokeswoman for the <a href="http://www.aclutx.org/index.php">ACLU of Texas</a> [advocacy website], which is representing some of the plaintiffs, <a href="http://www.aclutx.org/article.php?aid=621">said</a> [press release] after the judge&#39;s decision that <blockquote>[e]very court in the country that has reviewed these local anti-immigrant housing ordinances has put a stop to them. Farmers Branch has taken the curious approach of recreating their ordinance to be even more intrusive and offensive, to the point of subjecting everyone to an intrusive, Big Brother-like licensing regime. The city has lost sight not only of the law, but of common sense, in this case.</blockquote> Motions in the case are due October 29. AP has <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6016094.html">more</a>. The <em>Dallas Morning News</em> has <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/DN-fbimmigration_23met.ART.State.Edition1.26c0d92.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/farmersbranch_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dallas-suburb-faces-lawsuit-over.php">filed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report], several landlords and a former City Council member challenge the constitutionality of Ordinance 2952, alleging it denies immigrants equal protection and due process rights. The city passed the ordinance after an earlier law, <a href="http://www.ci.farmers-branch.tx.us/Communication/Ordinance%20No%202903.doc">Ordinance 2903</a> [DOC text], was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-federal-court-strikes-down-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by a US district judge last May as an infringement of federal supremacy in the area of <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Farmers Branch City Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dallas-suburb-approves-new-rental.php">passed the latest ordinance</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to cure that flaw. The ordinance requires anyone wishing to rent a single-family residence to obtain an occupancy license. A city building inspector would submit information from the license applications to a federal database, the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=1721c2ec0c7c8110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=1721c2ec0c7c8110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program</a> (SAVE) [official website], to determine an applicant&#39;s immigration status.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesman for South African <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile; ANC <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/people/mbeki.html">profile</a>] said Tuesday that Mbeki has challenged in the county&#39;s <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] allegations that he interfered with a case against Mbeki&#39;s political rival and current <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [party website] leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">Jacob Zuma</a> [JURIST news archive], calling the accusations unjust. Earlier this month Judge Chris Nicholson of the Pietermaritzburg High Court effectively <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-high-court-invalidates.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the latest case against Zuma on the grounds that Zuma had been deprived of the chance to respond to claims made against him and that &quot;political meddling&quot; in the case by Mbeki and others could not be excluded. ANC officials called for Mbeki&#39;s resignation on Friday, and during his <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/showc.asp?type=sp&include=president/sp/2008/sp0921210.htm&ID=1795">resignation speech</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/south-africa-president-resigns-after.php">report</a>] Sunday, Mbeki insisted that the allegations were without merit. According to AFP, Mbeki wrote in his court filing: <blockquote>It is unfair and unjust for me to be judged and condemned on the basis of the findings in the Zuma matter. ... These adverse findings have led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC -- a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years.</blockquote> Meanwhile, ANC officials have <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=848601">moved for Mbeki&#39;s resignation to be effective on Thursday</a> [Sapa report] and said that party deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe will <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jLHggDaNAug5JXOmUokNKWNaS8OQ">take over the presidency</a> [AFP report] until the 2009 elections. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jwg5P3sBxc05Xyc8vZeZ_g9yzAcA">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE48M02H.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Zuma has said that the charges against him were part of a politically motivated effort by Mbeki to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election, and argued that he had both a constitutional and statutory right to state his case before charges were brought. Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senegal-14-file-war-crimes-complaints.php">Complaints filed with a Senegal prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] last week by fourteen Chadian and Senegalese citizens alleging that former Chadian dictator <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">Hissene Habre</a> [HRW materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>] was responsible for war crimes and torture are merely &quot;judicial persecution,&quot; lawyers for Habre said in a <a href="http://www.lesoleil.sn/article.php3?id_article=39841">statement</a> [text, in French] Tuesday. Habre counsel Francois Serres of France and El Hadj Diouf of Senegal called the latest action as <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/web/depeches/0,14-0,39-37060036@7-60,0.html">&quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;poorly founded&quot;</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> report, in French] as previous complaints against Habre, and argued that the complainants&#39; central grievance is against Habre&#39;s political police force, Direction de la documentation et de la securite (DDS), rather than Habre himself. The case has not yet been opened, with concerns that trial costs may reach $40 million. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gS9aJepkimU51a3-lc86AebL_g7w">more</a>. <br /><br />Habre fled Chad for Senegal after being overthrown in 1990, and has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. Last month a Chadian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced him to death <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span></a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed against the state. The latest complaints filed against Habre are seen as an attempt to hasten Habre&#39;s Senegal trial. Senegal courts have <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite the issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] by Belgium pursuant to its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure to either try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to try him in Senegal and the Senegalese government later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-chad-president-facing-crimes-trial.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. Previously the Senegalese courts <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">dismissed an action against him in 2001</a> [HRW case backgrounder], claiming that they lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere. In July this year Senegal formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment giving the nation&#39;s courts jurisdiction over Habre&#39;s trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>(HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday called on the Saudi Arabian government to end its &#39;systematic discrimination&#39; against its <a href="http://www.theismaili.org/">Ismaili religious minority</a> [official website; Global Security <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-ismaili.htm">backgrounder</a>].  HRW urged Saudi officials to create a national institution to recommend remedies for discriminatory policies and to consider individual claims. HRW&#39;s deputy Middle East director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/22/saudia19804.htm">said</a> [HRW press release]: <blockquote>The Saudi government preaches religious tolerance abroad, but it has consistently penalized its Ismaili citizens for their religious beliefs. The government should stop treating Ismailis as second-class in employment, the justice system, and education...State-sponsored and officially tolerated discrimination against the Ismailis of Najran seriously threatens their identity and denies them basic rights</blockquote>  The report went on to assert that the official Council of Senior Religious Scholars has termed Ismailis &#8220;corrupt infidels [and] debauched atheists.&#8221;  HRW&#39;s comprehensive <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/saudiarabia0908/index.htm">report</a> [text] concludes: <blockquote>Official discrimination in Saudi Arabia against Ismailis encompasses government employment, religious practices, and the justice system. Government officials exclude Ismailis from decision making, and publicly disparage their faith. Following the clashes in April 2000, Saudi authorities imprisoned, tortured, and summarily sentenced hundreds of Ismailis, and transferred hundreds of Ismaili government employees outside the region. Underlying discriminatory practices have continued unabated. <br /><br />This report calls for the end to religious and ethnic discrimination against the Ismailis of Saudi Arabia, and accountability for the abuses Ismailis suffered following the clashes of 2000. Over the past 10 years, Ismailis have repeatedly sent delegations and addressed petitions to the governor of Najran and the central authorities in Riyadh, including the Human Rights Commission (an official body), but found little attention to their concerns.</blockquote> BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7629931.stm">more</a>; <span style="font-style:italic;">Khaleej Times</span> has <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2008/September/international_September2011.xml&section=international">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Growing tension between Ismailis and their Sunni governor led to violent clashes in April 2000, when security forces are said to have arrested and tortured hundreds after a leading Ismaili cleric was arrested for &quot;sorcery.&quot;  Approximately one million Ismailis live in Saudi Arabia&#39;s southwestern Najran province.  Earlier this month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hrw-calls-for-global-end-to-juvenile.php">urged</a> [JURIST report;  <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/crd0908/">HRW report</a>] Saudi Arabia and several of its neighbors to join in a global moratorium on the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty for juveniles</a> [JURIST news archive].  All five countries named by HRW are parties to the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention of the Rights of the Child</a> [text], which prohibits the &quot;imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Stable, wealthier countries like Denmark, Sweden, and New Zealand have the least perceived corruption and poorer, less stable countries like Haiti, Iraq, Myanmar and Somalia have the most, according to government accountability advocacy group <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> (TI) [advocacy website] in a report published Tuesday. TI&#39;s <a href="http://www.transparency.org/content/download/36589/575262">2008 Corruption Perceptions Index</a> (CPI) [press release, PDF; TI <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008">materials</a>], was a survey-based study of perceived governmental corruption in 180 states. TI called for international support to allow poorer countries to institute oversight reforms and anti-corruption enforcement, and for wealthier countries which have fallen in the rankings, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3436787,00.html">most notably the UK</a> [Deutsche Welle report], to take the threat of corruption more seriously. TI chair Huguette Labelle said that not only does poverty lead to corruption, but that the corruption itself often worsens economic and humanitarian problems in the most vulnerable countries:<blockquote>In the poorest countries, corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death, when money for hospitals or clean water is in play... The continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world&#8217;s societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and cannot be tolerated. But even in more privileged countries, with enforcement disturbingly uneven, a tougher approach to tackling corruption is needed.</blockquote>AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j04HaPl7i6E5ZJ37JLQkG4ipyc3A">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7631013.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In line with the report&#39;s claim that corruption is an endemic international problem, corruption allegations and investigations have recently made headlines around the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A legal adviser to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/transitpage.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ecj">news archive</a>] issued an <a href="opinion - http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&newform=newform&Submit=Submit&alljur=alljur&jurcdj=jurcdj&jurtpi=jurtpi&jurtfp=jurtfp&alldocrec=alldocrec&docj=docj&docor=docor&docop=docop&docav=docav&docsom=docsom&docinf=docinf&alldocnorec=alldocnorec&docnoj=docnoj&docnoor=docnoor&typeord=ALLTYP&docnodecision=docnodecision&allcommjo=allcommjo&affint=affint&affclose=affclose&numaff=&ddatefs=&mdatefs=&ydatefs=&ddatefe=&mdatefe=&ydatefe=&nomusuel=&domaine=&mots=%22age+concern%22&resmax=100">opinion</a> [ECJ materials] Tuesday that UK regulations permitting mandatory retirement policies do not violate an EU anti-discrimination law. ECJ Advocate General Jan Marzak concluded that although the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061031.htm">Employment Equality (Age) Regulations</a> [text] fall within the scope of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/news/2001/jul/directive78ec_en.pdf">European Directive on Equal Treatment</a> [text, PDF], age-based classifications are justifiable in some circumstances. Marzak wrote: <blockquote>[A] rule such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which permits employers to dismiss employees aged 65 or over if the reason for dismissal is retirement, can in principle be justified under Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/78 if that rule is objectively and reasonably justified in the context of national law by a legitimate aim relating to employment policy and the labour market and it is not apparent that the means put in place to achieve that aim of public interest are inappropriate and unnecessary for the purpose. </blockquote>The group <a href="http://www.ageconcern.org.uk">Age Concern England</a> [advocacy website], which challenged the UK regulations, <a href="http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/mandatoryretirement.asp">stated</a> [press release], &quot;Millions of older workers in the EU will be fuming that the Advocate General thinks ageism counts for less than other forms of discrimination.&quot; Advocate general opinions are not binding on the ECJ but are followed in most cases. Once the ECJ rules on the case, it will be returned to the UK <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/admin.htm">High Court</a> [official website], where the British government must present evidence to justify the regulations. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKTRE48M4SA20080923">more</a>. London&#39;s <em>Telegraph</em> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/pensions/3066833/Compulsory-retirement-at-65-can-stay-EU-court-indicates.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/eu-court-upholds-mandatory-retirement.php">rejected an advocate general&#39;s opinion</a> [JURIST report; OUT-LAW <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-8577">report</a>] in a Spanish <a href="http://">case</a> [ECJ materials] challenging an employer&#39;s mandatory retirement policy. The ECJ found that such policies do not violate the EU prohibition against age discrimination if intended to further the legitimate public interest of increasing employment and if the retirees are provided with full pensions. In February, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eu-court-says-employee-firing-over-in.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that dismissing an employee because she was undergoing <em>in vitro</em> fertilization treatment violated the equal treatment directive. In that case, an Austrian woman claimed that she was entitled to full payment of her salary and protection against dismissal from the time fertilization of her egg took place, even though the egg had not yet been implanted in her uterus.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thirteen state attorneys general urged the US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] Wednesday to withdraw a <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2008/pdf/E8-19744.pdf">proposed rule</a> [PDF text] that they said could threaten women&#39;s access to <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php ">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] and birth control. The Provider Conscience Regulation, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2008pres/08/20080821a.html">published</a> [HHS press release] last month, is intended to reinforce <a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/RS2142801142005.pdf">federal statutes</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] protecting healthcare providers who refuse to take part in abortions or other healthcare services on moral or religious grounds. Specifically, the proposed rule would require certain recipients of HHS funds to certify compliance with the conscience requirements and would strengthen mechanisms for enforcing them. In their <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?Q=423472&A=2795">formal comments</a> [press release and text] filed with HHS, the attorneys general wrote: <blockquote>Health care institutions should not be penalized and stripped of vital federal funding for ensuring that victims of rape and other sexual assault are provided prompt and adequate birth control and other medically necessary health care services. Vagueness and broad application, together with the penalty of withdrawal of critical federal health care funding to a health care entity that violates - even inadvertently - the proposed regulation may have substantial and significant consequences for the provision of health care to many Americans.<br /><br />The proposed regulation completely obliterates the rights of patients to legal and medically necessary health care services in favor of a single-minded focus on protecting a health care provider&#39;s right to claim a personal moral or religious belief. [sic]</blockquote>Thursday marks the end of the public comment period for the proposed rule. Among the groups submitting comments in favor of the regulations was <a href="http://www.aul.org/">Americans United for Life</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.aul.org/PR_09-24-08">stated</a> [press release], &quot;Protecting the rights of healthcare providers is critical to the continuing viability and safety of our healthcare system.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iEW9FYay0lFbUS4UMghrpSYEKE9AD93D74OO0">more</a>. <br /><br />Three federal statutes protect health care provider conscience rights. The <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00000300---a007-.html">Church Amendments</a> [text], enacted in the 1970s, prohibit recipients of HHS funds from discriminating against individuals who refuse to perform or participate in activities that offend their moral or religious beliefs. A <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00000238---n000-.html">provision</a> [text] added to the Public Health Service Act in 1996 prohibits discrimination against medical residents who object to being trained to perform abortions. The Weldon Amendments, part of HHS <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-2764">appropriations legislation</a> [text] since 2005, prohibit government agencies from discriminating against health care entities that do not provide, pay for or give referrals for abortions. Last year, Illinois officials reached a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with pharmacists who refused to dispense the so-called &quot;morning-after&quot; pill, requiring them to work with other pharmacists who would dispense the contraceptive. The pharmacists sued the state in 2005 after Gov. Rod Blagojevich <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=3&RecNum=3805">implemented an emergency rule</a> [press release] requiring pharmacists to dispense the contraceptive despite moral objections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/files/thomasruling.pdf">ordered</a> [decision, PDF] a new trial for a woman who had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/recording-labels-win-first-illegal-file.php">ordered to pay</a> [JURIST report] $222,000 to record companies for illegally posting copyrighted music on the file-sharing network <a href="http://www.kazaa.com/">Kazaa</a> [corporate website]. Jammie Thomas had sought the new trial on the grounds that the court erred by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/files/thomasjuryinstructions.pdf">instructing the jury</a> [instructions, PDF] that making the music available on the network alone was enough to violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/">Copyright Act</a> [text], and that the damages imposed against her were excessive. Judge Michael Davis granted the request, holding that the plaintiff, the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [association website], would have to persuade the jury that others had actually accessed the songs in order to recover from Thomas.  Without reaching the issue of whether or not the damages were excessive, Judge Davis urged Congress to distinguish damage amounts reasonable for personal users from those assessed for commercial use:<blockquote>The Court would be remiss if it did not take this opportunity to implore Congress to amend the Copyright Act to address liability and damages in peer?to?peer network cases such as the one currently before this Court.  The Court begins its analysis by recognizing the unique nature of this case.  The defendant is an individual, a consumer.  She is not a business.  She sought no profit from her acts.  The myriad of copyright cases cited by Plaintiffs and the Government, in which courts upheld large statutory damages awards far above the minimum, have limited relevance in this case.  All of the cited cases involve corporate or business defendants and seek to deter future illegal commercial conduct.  The parties point to no case in which large statutory damages were applied to a party who did not infringe in search of commercial gain. </blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h-s1m5-ok3ONlPQWlBPIv4MJbLpgD93DG43O0">more</a>. <font style="font-style:italic;">Wired</font> has <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/not-for-publica.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In March, another woman being sued by RIAA <a href="http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDFfull.asp?filename=andersen_atlantic_080314SecondAmendedComplaint">sought class action status</a> [amended complaint; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/riaa-facing-racketeering-fraud-spying.php">report</a>] for a <a href="http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Andersen_v_Atlantic">counterclaim</a> [case materials] against the RIAA, several recording companies, and data investigation company <a href="http://www.mediasentry.com/">MediaSentry</a> [corporate website] for allegedly using unscrupulous tactics as part of an RIAA anti-piracy campaign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Nebraska <a href="http://www.hhs.state.ne.us/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (DHHS) [official website] declared Thursday that leaving a child at a hospital does not constitute <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span> termination of parents&#39; legal rights.  Nebraska&#39;s <a href="http://uniweb.legislature.ne.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Final/LB157.pdf">safe haven law</a> (LB 157) [PDF text], which went into effect in July, prohibits prosecution when a child is left in a licensed hospital.  LB 157 was enacted to protect infants, but the measure was expanded to include the undefined word &quot;child.&quot;  The director of the DHHS Department of Children and Family Services <a href="http://www.hhs.state.ne.us/newsroom/newsreleases/2008/Sep/safehaven2.htm">said</a> [DHHS press release]: <blockquote>If abuse or neglect is uncovered that occurred before the child was turned over to a hospital, County Attorneys do have the option of filing charges.  The law only protects people from prosecution against the actual act of leaving the child at a hospital. There seems to be a misconception that when a child is dropped off at a hospital, the parents are absolved of responsibility. That couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth.</blockquote> Eleven children aged 1 to 17 years <a href="http://www.ketv.com/cnn-news/17553170/detail.html">were left at an Omaha hospital Wednesday</a> [KETV-Omaha report].  Given the broad interpretation of the term &quot;child,&quot; these parents will not face prosecution.  DHHS maintained that such abandonment was not intended to be covered by the provision, continuing: <blockquote>LB 157 was intended to protect helpless children who are in immediate danger, such as an infant who is left outside or unattended. It was not intended for those having difficulty parenting older youth who may be defiant, unruly or who have behavior problems.</blockquote> Nebraska lawmakers have since called for a clarifying amendment to the safe haven law. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlZbpXbUt5CbF3Ra6tEc-6uzzToAD93DPJO84">more</a>; USA Today has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-25-Left-kids_N.htm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Nebraska was the last of the fifty states to enact its <a href="http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/statutes/safehaven.cfm">infant safe haven law</a> [Child Welfare Information Gateway backgrounder], but all of the others apply strictly to children under one year old.  Nationwide, there are different requirements for what constitutes a &quot;safe haven:&quot; in some states, like Nebraska, infants may only be relinquished to a hospital; in others, licensed personnel at emergency medical services, police stations, and fire stations can accept infants.  In most states, once the safe haven provider has informed the local child services department that an infant has been abandoned, the department takes responsibility for the child and petitions the court for termination of the parent&#39;s parental rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Business research firm <a href="https://www.tmsearch.co.uk/tms/login.aspx?skin=tmos">TM Group</a> [corporate website] released a <a href="http://www.sourcewire.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=LXzTT">report</a> [press release] on Friday saying that the majority of UK lawyers are using client identification methods which do not comply with the county&#39;s anti-money-laundering regulations.  According to the report, 65% of those polled reported using only visual checks of identification, a method not endorsed by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/F/1/money_laundering_regulations2007.pdf">2007 Money Laundering Regulations</a> [PDF text]. The majority of those polled also said they believed the regulations to be unnecessary, but had been trained in the methods they recommended.<br /><br />As a sign of increasing concerns over money laundering, even some Swiss banks who are well known for strong privacy protections have recently released information on certain clients. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.ofj.admin.ch/bj/en/home.html">Swiss Justice Ministry</a> [official website] granted US investigators <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/switzerland-to-give-us-prosecutors.php">access to information</a> [JURIST report] about bank accounts of terrorism suspects.  Prosecutors in the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/vae/">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] requested the information in a four-year old investigation into money laundering to support terrorist activities.  The same year, the Swiss Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/swiss-court-denies-russian-request-for.php">denied a Russian request</a> [JURIST report] for the transfer of bank documents to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a> [JURIST news archive] which were relevant to an ongoing investigation into Russian oil giant <a href="http://www.yukos.com/">Yukos</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Telecommunications executives told the US <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Senate Commerce Committee</a> [official website] Thursday that their companies would refrain from using certain surveillance technology without users&#39; permission but stopped short of endorsing legislation to outlaw the practice. The committee <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=778594fe-a171-4906-a585-15f19e2d602a">hearing</a> [materials] to investigate the privacy practices of American Internet service providers (ISPs) focused on <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1716">deep packet inspection</a> (DPI) [Securityfocus.com backgrounder], a technique of compiling information about users&#39; browsing and online behavior for security and advertising purposes, generally without consent. Among the witnesses testifying was Thomas J. Tauke, executive vice president for <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/about/">Verizon Communications</a> [corporate website], who said in his <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/_files/ThomasTaukeTestimony.pdf">prepared remarks</a> [PDF text]: <blockquote>We can commit &#8211; and believe that all companies should commit &#8211; to a set of best practices in the area of online behavioral advertising. The principles and best practices should apply to all online companies regardless of their technology or the platform used. ... Verizon believes that before a company captures certain Internet-usage data for targeted or customized advertising purposes, it should obtain meaningful, affirmative consent from consumers. </blockquote>Representatives from <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=3309">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="http://www.timewarnercable.com/Corporate/AboutUs/">Time Warner Cable</a> [corporate websites] also appeared before the committee. In a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/internet/36934prs20080925.html">statement</a> [ACLU press release] responding to the hearing, an attorney for the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/internet/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] said Congress should draft legislation specifying &quot;what records ISPs may collect, with whom and under which circumstances they may shared&quot; and including &quot;severe penalties&quot; for violations.&quot; The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504135.html?hpid=sec-tech">more</a>. IGN News Service has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C400693880002574CF0046C17B.html?ref=technology">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The ACLU and other rights groups have <a href="">condemned the use of DPI</a> [ACLU privacy backgrounder] against ISP customers. The controversy over DPI follows numerous legal challenges to the surreptitious collection of information on Internet users for both security and commercial purposes. Last April, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that ISPs <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/new-jersey-high-court-rules-subpoena.php">may not turn over users&#39; personal information</a> [JURIST report] to police or other agencies unless they obtain a valid grand jury subpoena when the information sought relates to an indictable offense. In March, the German <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website] placed an <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-high-court-blocks-data.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a federal law that gave the government the ability to access and collect Internet and telephone data. In October 2007, the US <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">House Committee on Foreign Affairs</a> [committee website] voted <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-house-committee-approves-online.php">in favor of legislation</a> [JURIST report] aimed at preventing US Internet companies from turning over users&#39; personal information to governments that would use the data to quash dissent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bazelon.org/index.html">Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law</a> [advocacy website] this week released a <a href="http://www.bazelon.org/l21/YourMind-YourRights.pdf">guide</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.bazelon.org/l21/rightsguide.htm">press release</a>] addressing the legal rights of students seeking help for mental illness or emotional distress. The report, <em>Campus Mental Health: Know Your Rights!</em>, provides guidance to students on privacy, academic and disciplinary issues associated with mental health treatment at American colleges and universities. The guide advises students who are placed on involuntary leave or refused re-admission because of mental or emotional health issues to file grievances with their school&#39;s disability compliance officer. The Bazelon guide echoes the concerns of US <a href="http://durbin.senate.gov/">Sen. Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL), who introduced <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s3311is.txt.pdf">legislation</a> [S 3311] in July to improve mental and behavioral health services on college campuses. The bill is being reviewed by the <a href="http://help.senate.gov/">Senate Committee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions</a> [official website].<br /><br />On Tuesday, Congress passed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6983eh.txt.pdf">legislation</a> [H.R. 6983 text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/congress-passes-mental-health-parity.php">report</a>] to reduce inequities in the insurance coverage of mental health and addiction treatment by amending the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/usc_sup_01_29_10_18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974</a> (ERISA) [text]. The bill would bring insurance payments for such treatment in line with those for treatment of physical disorders. Mental health advocacy groups and insurance industry groups applauded the legislation, praising it as a step forward in the legal and social protection of those suffering from mental illness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">US Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Thursday voted in favor of the <a href="bill - http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h3971rfs.txt.pdf">Deaths in Custody Reporting Act</a> [HR 3971 text, PDF], which as passed by the House reauthorizes a program requiring states receiving criminal justice assistance grants to report to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] information about people who die while incarcerated or in police custody. The Senate committee amended the bill to ensure that federal detention center authorities report deaths under the same circumstances. Joanne Lin, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="http://www.aclu.org/intlhumanrights/immigrants%27rights/36936prs20080925.html">welcomed the revisions</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Today, senators closed the loophole that allowed deaths of immigration detainees in federal detention facilities to go unreported. The lack of transparency and accountability on the federal level under the current law meant that the public and advocacy groups have had to rely on word-of-mouth and media accounts to find out about deaths of immigration detainees. At least 69 people have died in immigration detention since 2004. A significant number of these deaths occurred in federal detention facilities. </blockquote>The ACLU has previously criticized conditions in US <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/detention/">immigrant detention facilities</a> [ACLU materials].<br /><br />The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, begun in 2000 and administered by the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> (BJS) [official website], receives death records quarterly from each state&#39;s prison and juvenile justice systems and from nearly 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies. The reports include the age, gender and race of the deceased, the criminal history of the deceased and the circumstances surrounding the death. This week, the group <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/us0908/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/23/usdom19872.htm">press release</a>] concluding that the US criminal justice system fails to meet many international standards for the treatment of crime victims. Among other proposed measures in the report, HRW recommended that the United States ratify the 1979 <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/">Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women</a> and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text and materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former US Marine filed a <a href="/pdf/sharratt.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Thursday alleging that US <a href="http://www.murtha.house.gov/">Rep. John Murtha</a> (D-PA) [official website] defamed him and violated his constitutional rights by suggesting that he had participated in killing innocent Iraqi civilians. In a complaint filed in the <a href="http://www.pawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], former Lance Cpl. <a href="http://www.justinsharratt.com/">Justin Sharratt</a> [defense website] accused Murtha of slandering him by saying in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/05/18/murtha.marines/index.html?iref=newssearch">televised comments</a> [CNN report and video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/marine-haditha-killings-worse-than-abu.php">report</a>] that Marines had killed women and children &quot;in cold blood&quot; in the city of <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Haditha/Haditha-Timeline.htm">Haditha</a> [USMC timeline; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/haditha.php">news archive</a>] in November 2005. According to Sharratt&#39;s complaint, <blockquote><br />Sharratt, as a direct result of Murtha&#39;s false, defamatory statements, has lost significant employment opportunities. ... Sharratt, also as a direct result of Murtha&#8217;s false, defamatory statements, has lost and will continue to lose significant associational opportunities. ... Sharratt, in being labeled repeatedly by Murtha as a &quot;cold-blooded murderer&quot;, and by Murtha outrageously claiming that the Haditha incident was comparable to the infamous My Lei massacre of Vietnam, has suffered permanent, irreversible damage to his reputation. </blockquote>Murder charges against Sharratt were <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/charges-dismissed-against-two-us.php">dismissed</a> last year after an investigating officer <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/dnp-haditha.php">concluded</a> [JURIST reports] that witness testimony against him was unreliable and that forensic evidence tended to support his version of the events. Murtha&#39;s office did not comment on Sharratt&#39;s lawsuit. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h5WevvJUXQrfbMEFvMlEojd7tA6wD93DVLEO1">more</a>. The <em>Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</em> has <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_590214.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Sharratt&#39;s lawsuit is the second arising from Murtha&#39;s comments about the Haditha killings. In 2006, <a href="http://www.frankwuterich.com/">Marine Sgt. Frank Wuterich</a> [defense website; <em>Time</em> <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1535831,00.html">profile</a>], then under investigation in connection with the killings, sued Murtha for alleged defamation and invasion of privacy. A federal district judge last year <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-murtha.php">refused to dismiss that lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] and ordered Murtha to give a deposition. Responding to that lawsuit, Murtha <a href="http://www.murtha.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=106&Itemid=62">said</a> [press release] his remarks were intended &quot;to draw attention to the horrendous pressure put on our troops in Iraq and to the cover-up of the incident.&quot; Wuterich, who commanded the unit implicated in the killings, was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/haditha-marine-squad-leader-to-face.php">charged</a> last year with voluntary manslaughter and related offenses, but his court-martial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed indefinitely</a> [JURIST reports] this past March. In June, a court-martial <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-marine-cleared-of-all-charges-in.php">acquitted</a> a Marine intelligence officer of various charges related to the killings, and charges against five other Marines have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/military-judge-drops-charges-against-us.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge of the Ontario <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/en/">Superior Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Thursday convicted one of the &quot;Toronto 18&quot; terrorism suspects for participating in a group which allegedly plotted to behead <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] while attacking parliament. <a href="http://www.carswell.com/authors/showprofile.asp?aid=525">Justice John Sproat</a> [profile] rejected arguments that the defendant had known nothing of the plot even though he had attended a military-style training camp. Sproat found that the defendant had received clear direction from a &quot;mentor&quot; regarding the purpose of the camp and had &quot;a full appreciation of the nature of the terrorist group.&quot; The defendant has not been publicly identified pursuant to the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Y-1.5">Youth Criminal Justice Act</a> [text] because he was a minor at the time of his <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/canada-police-arrest-17-suspected-of.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. Prosecutors have said they would seek an adult sentence of up to 10 years. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jdy4_YFHyluYzWvIRZRq-xF1o1zwD93E1TIO0">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Toronto Star</span> has <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/505905">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Thursday&#39;s conviction was the first under <a href="http://www.justice-canada.info/eng/antiter/sheet-fiche/def_ter/def_ter1.html">Section 83</a> [Canadian DOJ backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Lang=E&Chamber=N&StartList=A&EndList=Z&Session=9&Type=0&Scope=I&query=2981&List=toc-1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text], passed in 2001. The law allows the Canadian federal government, subject to judicial approval, to arrest and jail citizens to prevent terrorism. Although little information was released about the minors arrested among the <a href="http://www.toronto18.com/">Toronto 18</a> [defense website], the charges against the 12 adult males included participating in a terrorist group, receiving training from a terrorist group, training terrorists, and importing weapons and ammunition for terrorism. Trials for most of the adult defendants are expected to take place next year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1546.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court&#39;s grant of judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft Corp.</a> [corporate website] in a suit involving alleged infringement of digital music patents held by <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal?COUNTRY_CODE=US&COOKIE_SET=false">Alcatel-Lucent</a> [corporate website].  The court ruled that of the two patents, Microsoft had not infringed one and had a license for the other.  The court reasoned:<blockquote>A grant of JMOL is appropriate when &#39;the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, permits ony one reasonable conclusion and that conclusion is contrary to the jury&#39;s...A patentee may rely on either direct or circumstantial evidence to prove infringement.  In order to prove direct infringement, a patentee must either point to specific instances of direct infringement or show that the accused device necessarily infringes the patent in suit.  Lucent did not show specific instances of direct infringement.  Instead, Lucent relied on circumstantial evidence to attempt to show that Microsoft&#39;s Windows Media Player necessary infringes [its] patent.<br /><br />The district court found, however, that the circumstantial evidence presented by Lucent established only uncertainty and speculation as to whether [its technology] had run even once [in Windows Media Player]...Lucent has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that [its technology] actually runs on Windows Media Player and thus it would be too speculative to conclude that Windows Media Pladecisionyer necessarily infringes [Lucent&#39;s] patent. </blockquote> Disappointed with the decision, an Alcatel-Lucent spokesperson <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200809251636DOWJONESDJONLINE000890_FORTUNE5.htm">told reporters</a> [CNN Money report], &quot;It is too early to speculate on what our next steps might be.&quot;  Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN2552015720080925?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>.<br /><br />The patents govern technology that converts audio input into MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, more commonly known as MP3, which Microsoft has incorporated into several variants of its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/">Windows Media Player</a> [product website]. Last August, a San Diego district court granted Microsoft JMOL or, in the alternative, a new trial following <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-judge-overturns-152b-verdict.php">the $1.52 billion jury award</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/download/legal/Other/08-06-07Alcatel-LucentRuling.pdf">opinion</a>, PDF] originally granted after <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-jury-orders-microsoft-to-pay.php">Microsoft lost at trial</a> [JURIST report].

Four men who have since been deported filed suit in 2006 arguing that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ashcroft-bio.html">Attorney General John Ashcroft</a> [official profile] lacked statutory authority to pass such a measure, and claiming also that their constitutional rights had been violated because they were deported &quot;based on their religion, ethnicity, gender, and race.&quot;  The court disagreed, holding:<blockquote>[I]mmigration regulation differs fundamentally from the legal contexts relied upon because classifications on the basis of nationality are frequently unavoidable in immigration matters . . . Indeed, the very concept of &#39;alien&#39; is a nationality-based classification . . . [T]here is no tension whatsoever between Congress passing specific laws targeting terrorism and the Attorney General using broad powers granted under existing statutes toward the same end.<br /><br />There was a rational national security basis for the Program.  The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 were facilitated by the lax enforcement of immigration laws.  The Program was designed to monitor more closely aliens from certain countries selected on the basis of national security criteria.  The individual subject to special registration under the Program were neither citizens nor even lawful permanent residents.  They were asked to provide information regarding their immigration status and other matters relevant to national security . . . In sum, . . . [we conclude] that the Program does not violate Equal Protection guarantees.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110ap_monitoring_muslims.html?source=rss">more</a>.<br /><br />The program, which was implemented in 2002 following the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and later moved under the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] after its implementation in 2003, was criticized by some who said that the requirements were poorly publicized, that it created &quot;deportation traps&quot; and alienated law-abiding visitors while doing little to enhance national security.  DHS <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/controversial-nonimmigrant.htm">terminated the program</a> [JURIST report] in November 2003, but the registration database still exists.

Wiley, who assisted the Iraqi High Tribunal (IHT) during the trial of Hussein, claimed that Judge Munthur Hadi, one of the judges on the panel that issued the <a href="http://hrw.org/pub/2007/ij/dujail_judgement_web.pdf">verdict</a> [text, PDF] and death sentence against Hussein, was removed from the proceedings at the behest of the government of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile]. While the alleged rationale behind Hadi&#39;s removal is a recent revelation, a number of similar objections were raised at the time by Hussein defense counsel and others writing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saddam+hussein&blog_id=208574">op-eds on the Hussein trial</a> [JURIST Forum archive] for JURIST. Hussein lawyers <a href="/forumy/2006/04/farce-of-law-trial-of-saddam-hussein.php">Curtis Doebbler</a> and <a href="/forumy/2006/11/another-side-of-saddam-hussein-trial.php">Giovanni Di Stefano</a> [JURIST op-eds] repeatedly complained of political interference with the IHT judiciary allegedly brought about by those seeking to secure a death sentence for Hussein. <a href="/forumy/2006/11/saving-rule-of-law-in-iraq-move.php">Chibli Mallat</a> [JURIST op-ed], who was asked to serve on the special tribunal trying Hussein but declined to do so, also expressed process concerns. <br /><br />The trial and execution of Hussein was met with widespread condemnation by <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/un-judicial-expert-slams-saddam-trial.php">international organizations</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/rights-groups-protest-saddam-hanging.php">rights groups</a> [JURIST reports], including <a href="http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGMDE144302006">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/12/30/iraq14950.htm">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy press releases]. HRW released a <a href="http://hrw.org/backgrounder/ij/iraq0607/iraq0607web.pdf">briefing paper</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/saddam-hussein-judgment-contained.php">report</a>] in June 2006 detailing factual and legal errors in the trial, including sole reliance on the political affiliation of the defendants to determine knowledge of the Dujail crimes, and failure of the judgment to establish clear lines of operation control needed to prove the culpability of the higher officials for the acts of the military. The report also found serious flaws in the decision issued by IHT Appeals Chamber, including instances where it came to faulty legal conclusions based upon factual findings never made by the Trial Chamber. HRW says that the trial was also plagued by political interference from the Iraqi government and emphasized that the procedural and substantive deficiencies in the Dujail trial remain prevalent in the <A src="/jurist_search.php?q=Anfal">Anfal genocide trial</A> [JURIST news archive; BBC trial <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5272224.stm">timeline</A>], where six former Hussein-era defendants are facing genocide charges for their alleged involvement in the slaughter of thousands of Kurds during the 1988 <A HREF="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/">&quot;Anfal campaign&quot;</A> [HRW backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.minorityrights.org/">Minority Rights Group International</a> (MRGI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php?id=537">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.minorityrights.org/7311/press-releases/states-slow-to-encourage-african-court-says-international-human-rights-group.html">press release</a>] Wednesday criticizing the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/news_en.html">African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights</a> [official website] for its failure to effectively institute a court to adjudicate human rights issues on the continent. MRGI said the <a href="http://www.aict-ctia.org/courts_conti/achpr/achpr_home.html">African Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights</a> [AICT backgrounder] has not yet begun to hear cases despite its establishment 10 years ago, attributing the delay to disputes between the court and the commission and a lack of strong support from <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] countries. According to the report,<blockquote>[t]here is no doubt about the scale of the needs. In the time that has elapsed, countless human rights violations have taken place on the African continent, with minorities and indigenous peoples particularly affected. As some of the poorest and most vulnerable communities on the continent, minority and indigenous people experience multiple human rights violations on a daily basis. Yet, due to their marginalized position, states are often indifferent to their plight. A strong legal mechanism is therefore essential if the rights of Africa&#8217;s minorities and indigenous peoples are to be realised. [sic]</blockquote>Despite the setbacks, MRGI commended preliminary steps that had been made in selecting <a href="http://www.pict-pcti.org/courts/ACHPR.html">judges</a> [PICT profiles], rules and locations for the court. The group urged the African countries which have not already signed the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html">protocol</a> [text] recognizing the court to do so. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7633383.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Although most human rights cases arising from the continent are currently tried by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], relations between the court and African groups have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">strained</a> [JURIST report] since the decision by ICC chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] to seek the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] on war crimes charges. Earlier this week, Moreno-Ocampo traveled to New York to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/424.html">gain support</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-prosecutor-making-case-for-sudan.php">report</a>] from UN and AU members for al-Bashir&#39;s arrest. In August, Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">threatened to ignore</a> any ICC-issued arrest warrant, saying he would not &quot;deal with or respond to&quot; the ICC. Moreno-Ocampo has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">criticized Sudan&#39;s own investigation</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes in Darfur, calling it &quot;part of the coverup.&quot; Sudan&#39;s justice minister recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">appointed several prosecutors</a> to investigate and try war crimes suspects in <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">internationally monitored courts</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The UN Human Rights Council completed its <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/9session/">ninth session</a> [UNHRC materials; UNOG <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/48F227A9592586D4C12574BA004E33CA?OpenDocument&cntxt=D3C1F&cookielang=en">report</a>] in Geneva Wednesday by adopting 24 texts, one of which included a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/B64084F92EA8ADB9C12574CE00596D3F?opendocument">decision</a> [press release; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28238&Cr=human+rights+council&Cr1=sudan">report</a>] to extend the mission of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Sudan, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/sd/mandate/">Sina Samar</a> [official website], until June 2009. The President of the Council, Martin Ihoeghian Uhomoibi, said that the decision was reached through sponsorship by both the EU and the African Group. Uhomoibi added praise for the work of both sides in renewing the mandate, saying that the resolution <blockquote>gives room and recognition to some of the positive steps that the Sudanese Government has taken. The idea is not to be punitive. The idea is to encourage. It is meant to do what is needed in the interest of human rights and the rights of all citizens. </blockquote>At a meeting in Geneva last week, Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/sudan-calls-for-end-to-un-special.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the Council not to renew Samar&#39;s mandate.  The remarks, made by Sudanese Ministry of Justice Under-Secretary Abdel Daiem Zumarawi, came after Special Rapporteur Samar presented the Council with her <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G08/154/14/PDF/G0815414.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] on human rights in Sudan, in which she called the situation &quot;grim.&quot;  Zumarawi <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/E81A32B0C2DE3E20C12574C600493513?opendocument">responded</a> [UN press release] to the report by saying that it criticized Sudan&#39;s efforts to restore human rights in the country and claimed that not renewing the mandate would give further reason to end the conflict in Sudan.  Rueters has <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LO263604.htm">more</a>.  The Sudan Tribune has <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28735">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Since civil war broke out in Sudan&#39;s <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2003, it is estimated that over 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced. Reports by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (UNHCHR) and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee for the Red Cross</a> [official websites] have documented numerous violations of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-rights-body-calls-for-immediate.php">human rights</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/all-sides-violating-human-rights-in.php">international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST reports] based on interviews with refugees, rebel groups, and agencies and authorities working in the region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military prosecutor at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] filed a declaration with the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commissions</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">news archive</a>] Wednesday stating that he is resigning because of ethical concerns. Army Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld said potentially exculpatory evidence had been withheld from defense attorneys for Afghan detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsJawad.html">Mohammed Jawad</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohammed+jawad">news archive</a>], who is <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of throwing a grenade at US soldiers and an interpreter. As quoted in media reports, Vandeveld wrote in the sworn statement: <blockquote>My ethical qualms about continuing to serve as a prosecutor relate primarily to the procedures for affording defense counsel discovery. I am highly concerned, to the point that I believe I can no longer serve as a prosecutor at the Commissions, about the slipshod, uncertain &quot;procedure&quot; for affording defense counsel discovery. </blockquote>Army Col. Lawrence Morris, chief prosecutor for the military commissions, told reporters Vandeveld had &quot;no grounds for ethical qualms.&quot; Vandeveld, a reservist, has asked to be returned to civilian status. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/24/AR2008092402101.html?sub=AR">more</a>. The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/700445.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Vandeveld is the fourth prosecutor known to have left the military commissions at least in part because of ethical concerns. Last year, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2006/d20060111Davis.pdf">Air Force Col. Morris Davis</a> [official profile, PDF] <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2006/d20060111Davis.pdf">requested a transfer</a> [JURIST report] from his position as chief prosecutor, complaining of political interference with the commissions. In 2004, Air Force Maj. Robert Preston and Air Force Capt. John Carr asked for new assignments after <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/two-former-prosecutors-sharply.php">telling their supervisors</a> [JURIST report] in e-mail messages that the military tribunals were &quot;a fraud&quot; and &quot;rigged.&quot; This month, US <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hartmann">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/controversial-guantanamo-legal-advisor.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] from his position as legal advisor to the commissions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Wednesday approved a controversial bill providing for provincial elections in much of the country. Kurdish legislators had strongly opposed a provision establishing a provincial council in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity.org backgrounder] made up of equal numbers of Kurdish, Arab and Turkmenian representatives. After <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-parliament-fails-to-approve-power.php">several failures</a> [JURIST report], the parliament accepted a UN-proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080924-5.html">compromise</a> [White House press release] allowing elections in the rest of the country to proceed, as former opponents of the plan said they were confident an agreement could be reached to carry out elections in Kirkuk. The legislation is expected to be approved by the three-member Presidency Council, allowing for elections by January. Earlier this month, Iraqi lawmakers agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iraq-lawmakers-divide-control-of-kirkuk.php">temporarily divide control of Kirkuk</a> [JURIST report] among the city&#39;s ethnic groups until a permanent governing plan is established. AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080924/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iraq">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gBZ-CIF1Zox5Xl27_LfEi7qoa5Pw">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, Kurdish parliamentarians <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/kurdish-lawmakers-protest-draft.php">staged a walkout</a> [JURIST report], delaying a vote on the proposed provincial election bill that they said was unconstitutional.  The bill passed despite the boycott, but <a href="http://www.cabinet.iq/">Iraqi President Jalal Talabani</a> [official website, in Arabic; party <a href="http://www.puk.org/web/htm/about/talab.html">profile</a>] and the two other members of the Iraqi Presidency Council later <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iraq-president-rejects-draft-election.php">refused to sign it</a> [JURIST report] because it had been passed by an incomplete parliament. In February, Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected an earlier draft  elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation, <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month, that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Jury selection began Wednesday in <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] for the torture trial of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Charles+Emmanuel">Charles McArthur Emmanuel</a> [JURIST news archive], son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. Earlier this month, Emmanuel <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/son-of-ex-liberian-president-taylor.php">pleaded</a> [JURIST report] not guilty after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/us-grand-jury-indicts-son-of-former.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in December on charges that he was involved with killings and torture in Liberia. Emmanuel, a US citizen raised in Boston, was the first person indicted under a 1994 <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113C.html">federal anti-torture statute</a> [18 USC 2340A text]. The eight-count <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/Attachments/061206-01.Indictment.pdf">indictment</a> [PDF text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/fls/PressReleases/061206-01.html">press release</a>] accused Emmanuel of using electric shocks, lit cigarettes, stinging ants, molten plastic and bayonets to torture victims from 1999 to 2002. More specifically, he was accused of shooting three random victims at a April 1999 bridge checkpoint and then ordering another&#39;s throat slit after he attempted to escape. AP has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26793159/">more</a>. The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/story/698903.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, US District Judge Cecilia Altonaga <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-upholds-torture-charges.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the torture charges, rejecting Emmanuel&#39;s argument that the federal statute under which he was charged exceeds Congressional authority because it criminalizes behavior of foreign government officials outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Last December, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-judge-denies-bail-for-son-of.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] for Emmanuel, ruling that he was a flight risk and a danger to the community.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Thailand Court of Appeals ruled against former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Samak+Sundaravej">news archive</a>] Thursday, upholding defamation convictions against him and an associate, Dusit Siriwan. The charges stem from a 2006 television appearance in which both men allegedly insinuated that former Bangkok deputy governor Samart Rajpolasidhi was involved in a vote-rigging scheme. Samak and Dusit were convicted of four counts of libel and sentenced to two years in prison. Samak was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-high-court-ousts-pm-for.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] earlier this month on charges that he violated the constitution when he accepted payment for his appearance on a <a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Thailand-Constitutional-Court-Tells-PM-Samak-Sundaravej-To-Step-Down-In-TV-Cooking-Show-Row/Article/200809215095879?f=rss">television cooking program</a> [SkyNews report, with video]. At trial, the court unanimously rejected Samak&#39;s defense that he <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aCjyC3VgdK7A&refer=asia">received only an honorarium</a> [Bloomberg report] as a freelance actor when he appeared on the show. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hgGheViXUA5CT7PS8H4umb9UPKrAD93DJJ5O0">more</a>. The <em>Nation</em> has <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/topstory/read.php?newsid=30084349">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Early this month, Samak <a href="http://media.thaigov.go.th/pageconfig/viewcontent/viewcontent1e.asp?pageid=472&directory=1944&contents=23369">imposed a state of emergency</a> [press release] in Bangkok following weeks of anti-government protests. Members of the opposition People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) party refused to recognize the order as they demanded Samak&#39;s resignation. Samak resisted those calls and instead <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-pm-proposes-confidence.php">proposed a national referendum</a> [JURIST report] on whether he should continue in office. PAD announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">seek Samak&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] in July after a series of court decisions against key officials in the government and the PPP.  Three weeks ago, Thailand&#39;s Election Commission <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">voted to recommend</a> [JURIST report] that the PPP be disbanded for election fraud allegedly committed by one of its former top officers.

The bill had originally contained the clause, but lawmakers said it was taken out because of uncertainty on how to determine the number of seats to be set aside for the groups. Al-Maliki said that the representation guarantee would help assuage minority fears of oppression, and on Sunday hundreds of Iraqi Christians protested the deletion of the clause. The provincial elections bill was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-parliament-approves-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s parliament last week, but still must be approved by a three-member Presidency Council before becoming law.

After <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/iraq-parliament-fails-to-approve-power.php">several failures</a> [JURIST report], the parliament accepted a UN-proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080924-5.html">compromise</a> [White House press release] allowing elections in the rest of the country to proceed, as former opponents of the plan said they were confident an agreement could be reached to carry out elections in Kirkuk.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] London&#39;s High Court of Justice on Tuesday <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/judgments_guidance/limbu-others.pdf">struck down</a> [judgment text, PDF] an immigration policy that has prevented thousands of retired Nepalese members of the British Army from remaining in the UK. Earlier this month, five former members of the <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/index.htm">Brigade of Gurkhas</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2786991.stm">backgrounder</a>] and one Gurkha widow <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/former-gurkha-soldiers-make-court.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that they were precluded from settling within the UK by a discretionary policy laid out for immigration officers in <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/ecg/chapter29/#point%20four">Diplomatic Service Procedures: Entry Clearance Volume 1 General Instructions</a> [Chapter 29.4 text].  Declaring that the discretionary instructions are &quot;unlawful and need urgent revisiting,&quot; Justice Blake ruled: <blockquote>Transparency and clarity are significant requirements of instructions to immigration and entry clearance officers that are published to the world at large, generate expectations of fair treatment and bind appellate bodies in the performance of their statutory functions. The policy under challenge in this case either irrationally excluded material and potentially decisive considerations that the context and the stated purpose of the policy indicate should have been included; alternatively, it was so ambiguous as to the expression of its scope as to mislead applicants, entry clearance officers and immigration judges alike as to what was a sufficient reason to substantiate a discretionary claim to settlement here.</blockquote>  Blake left details of a &quot;rational future policy&quot; to be determined by the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office</a> [official website], calling for the individual decisions in the case to be revisited within the next three months.  He added: <blockquote>[R]ewarding long and distinguished service by the grant of residence in the country for which the service was performed would, in my judgment, be a vindication and an enhancement of [the Military Covenant].</blockquote>  After the ruling, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idINLU37595820080930">promised</a> [Reuters report] that the guidelines will be revised and all Gurkha cases will be reviewed by the end of the year.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7644441.stm">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span> has <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/gurkhas-win-right-to-stay-in-uk-947023.html">additional coverage</a>.    <br /><br />In 2007, a <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/DefencePolicyAndBusiness/GurkhasToReceiveBritishTermsAndConditionsOfService.htm">Ministerial Announcement</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/em/uksiem_20072608_en.pdf">explanatory memorandum</a>, PDF] provided that all Gurkhas retiring on or after July 1, 1997 would be offered &quot;the choice of discharge in Nepal or in UK.&quot; Gurkhas who retired from service prior to July 1997 - the year that the Gurkha base was moved from Hong Kong to the UK - are currently required to apply for visas, which are commonly denied because the applicants are not considered to have adequate ties to the UK.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.lp.gov.lb/">Lebanese Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Monday approved a new election law as part of a peace deal between pro- and anti-Syrian groups within the country. Many of the provisions included in the law, which  guarantees candidates equal airtime and imposes a 24 hour ban on media coverage and a 10 day ban on political polling before an election, were designed to permit limited media coverage of elections. There will also be a fixed limit placed on candidates&#39; campaign expenditures, election districts will be expanded, and the vote-casting period will shortened to one day under the new law. Provisions to lower the country&#39;s voting age to 18, guarantee women parliamentary seats, and provide for absentee ballots for citizens abroad were dropped before approval. Despite the law&#39;s purported aim of modernizing the country&#39;s election protocols, critics have said it <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&article_id=96399&categ_id=17">does not go far enough</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</font> op-ed] to balance control and influence of Lebanese politics.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Leaders from Thailand&#39;s ruling People Power Party (PPP) said on Tuesday that the PPP plans to introduce amendments to the country&#39;s 2007 <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/download/Constitution2007byIFES.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF text], despite likely opposition. A spokesperson for the government said that in <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=131004">forming a new committee</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] to draft the changes, the ruling coalition would seek input from both professional experts and members of the opposition party, the People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD). Proponents of the plan argue that the changes, including giving more authority to elected officials and less to Thailand&#39;s courts, are necessary to provide for stronger democratic rule of the country. Opponents of the plan support strong judicial oversight provisions in the current charter, and argue that the PPP is too closely connected with former prime minister&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ousted by military coup</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in 2006, largely due to allegations of corruption. AFP has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_284365.html">more</a>.<br /><br />On Monday, the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/thai/default.html">Election Commission</a> (EC) [official website, in Thai] said it would <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/300908_News/30Sep2008_news10.php">begin an investigation</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok post</font> report] into allegations that current prime minister <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/09/17/headlines/headlines_30083657.php">Somchai Wongsawat</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Nation</font> backgrounder] illegally holds stocks in certain companies.  Under the Thai constitution, public officials are prohibited from having stock in either telecommunications or media companies,  or companies that receive government contracts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] approved a resolution Monday to extend the terms of some judges serving on the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] to allow them to complete their assigned cases. The resolution, which was unanimously approved, will extend the terms of four Appeals Chamber judges to the end of 2010 and the terms of 10 Trial Chamber judges, 14 temporary judges now serving on the tribunal and another 13 temporary judges not currently serving on the tribunal to the end of 2009. This resolution complements a February <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/sc9257.doc.htm">resolution</a> [Res. 1800 text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/icty-to-appoint-additional-judges-to.php">report</a>] authorizing Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to appoint four additional judges to the ICTY in an effort to try all defendants by the end of 2008. The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28345&Cr=ICTY&Cr1=">more</a>.<br /><br />Under the ICTY&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/publications-e/assessments/index.htm">completion strategy</a> [ICTY materials], all trials are to finish this year, and all appeals are scheduled to conclude by the end of 2010. In 2005, ICTY officials <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/hague-war-crimes-court-will-miss-case.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that the ICTY would miss the 2008 deadline to wrap up all of the criminal trials, blaming Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian leaders for failing to turn over key fugitives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former CIA executive director <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=foggo">Kyle Foggo</a> [JURIST news archive] pleaded guilty Monday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to one count of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001343----000-.html">wire fraud</a> [18 USC s. 1343 text] relating to charges that he accepted bribes in return for granting federal defense contracts. Foggo was originally <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/indictment_foggo_wilkes.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/ex-cia-top-official-indicted-with.php">report</a>] in February 2007 on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering in connection with allegations that his friend and defense contractor <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/52283">Brent Wilkes</a> [Newsweek profile] gave him gifts and promised him a job in return for the granting of CIA defense contracts. In May 2008 the <a href="http://www.expose-the-war-profiteers.org/archive/legal/2008-1/20080520.pdf">indictment was amended</a> [indictment, PDF] to include counts of conflict of interest and additional counts of fraud, but following Foggo&#39;s guilty plea Monday, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges against him. Foggo could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but the prosecutors said they will recommend a jail sentence of no longer than 37 months. Sentencing is scheduled for January 8. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092901148.html?hpid=topnews">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php">All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> (APPG) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/141-legal-opinion-on-detainee-handovers-by-uk-forces">legal opinion</a> [text, PDF] on Monday which examines UK governmental liability under the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text, PDF] and the UK <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/plain/ukpga_19980042_en">Human Rights Act 1998</a> (HRA) [text] for its participation in the CIA <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. The opinion states that a human rights violation under both the ECHR and the HRA would occur where &quot;an individual in British detention in Iraq is handed over to US military personnel despite substantial grounds for considering that there is a real risk of that person being subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment.&quot; The opinion also determined that US assurances that suspects handed over by the UK would not be tortured would not be sufficient to absolve the UK of its obligations under the ECHR and the HRA:<blockquote>The United States Government has registered reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture stipulating that it considers itself bound by the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment only to the extent that it is prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution and, moreover, the reservation also sets out a definition of torture that is narrower than that accepted by courts in the United Kingdom (in particular, in referring to an act intended to inflict severe physical pain and suffering). An undertaking not to engage in inhuman and degrading treatment or torture would not therefore necessarily be sufficient to discharge the United Kingdom&#8217;s obligations under the ECHR. ... The US military, which would be responsible for the detention of detainees handed-over by the British military authorities, are known to have applied &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221; to those within their custody believed to have intelligence value. These techniques are capable of amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment and torture in domestic law. In A (No. 2), Lord Hope, in considering what conduct is capable of amounting to torture, stated that some of the interrogation techniques authorized for use in Guantanamo Bay, &#8220;would shock the conscience if they were ever to be authorized for use in our own country&#8221; (A (No.2) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [...]. Lord Bingham stated that the interrogation techniques used by British authorities in Northern Ireland during the troubles, which were categorized as &#8220;inhuman and degrading&#8221; by the ECtHR in Ireland v United Kingdom (1978) 2 EHRR 25, would today be regarded as torture [...] </blockquote> The <em>Guardian</em> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/29/military.law">more</a>.<br /><br />The APPG was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/parliamentary-group-challenging.php">convened in December 2005</a> [JURIST report] to call for a formal inquiry into whether the British government violated international law by aiding the CIA rendition flights. In July, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee called &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-commons-committee-deplores-false-us.php">deplorable</a>&quot; [JURIST report] what it termed &quot;false US assurances&quot; about extraordinary rendition flights through the UK Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. In July 2007, the UK Intelligence and Security Committee said it had <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/no-evidence-of-direct-uk-involvement-in.php">found no evidence</a> [JURIST report] of direct UK involvement in the operation of the extraordinary rendition flights through UK airspace, and said that the United States&#39; lack of regard for UK concerns in the war on terror had &quot;serious implications for the working of the relationship between the US and UK intelligence and security agencies.&quot; In August 2006, the former head of the British domestic spy agency <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/uk-spy-agency-chief-refuses-to-testify.php">refused to testify</a> [JURIST report] before a joint parliamentary human rights committee investigating UK anti-terrorism practices.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate voted Saturday to approve <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h2638enr.txt.pdf">spending legislation</a> [H.R. 2638 text, PDF] approving the expiration of a Congressional moratorium on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive]. The spending bill, known as the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, was approved in the Senate by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00208">78-12</a> [roll call vote]. The moratorium, first enacted in 1982 as the Outer Continental Shelf Moratorium, denied the US <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] the funds to pursue oil and natural gas exploration off of the US Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The expiration of the moratorium via the Senate vote follows a House of Representatives vote two weeks ago passing a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6899ih.txt.pdf">comprehensive energy bill</a> [H.R. 6899, PDF] that would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-house-passes-legislation-to-lift.php">partially lift the offshore oil drilling ban</a> [JURIST report]. The House bill would authorize drilling activities 50 miles beyond the Pacific or Atlantic coastlines, part of the 85 percent of US coastal waters which have been off-limits for drilling since 1981. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/28/AR2008092800034.html?hpid=moreheadlines">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-lifts-executive-order-banning.php">lifted an executive ban on offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST report] put in place during his father&#39;s presidential administration. In June, Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html">called on Congress to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">report</a>], saying that it should also allow drilling to begin in the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> [official website] in Alaska.  Bush argued that resources currently off-limits to energy companies could offset rising fuel prices.  Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] in the Arctic, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require several years and a massive infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov">House of Representatives</a> on Monday rejected a financial rescue <a href="http://www.cspan.org/pdf/finance_bill_092808.pdf">bill</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/SECTIONBYSECTIONANALYSISOFTHELEGISLATION.pdf">summary</a>] that would have allowed courts to review purchases of troubled assets made by the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov">Treasury Department</a> [official website]. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, defeated by a vote of 228-205, would have permitted courts to set aside Treasury actions that were &quot;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law.&quot; The bill further shielded the Treasury secretary from injunctive relief except for constitutional violations and provided that any requests for restraining orders or injunctions be considered on an expedited basis. CNN has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/news/economy/bailout/index.htm?cnn=yes">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, Senate Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senate-democrats-fault-lack-of-judicial.php">questioned the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the Bush administration&#39;s proposed version of the legislation, which would have precluded judicial oversight of the asset purchases. Led by US <a href="http://dodd.senate.gov/">Sen. Christopher Dodd</a> (D-CT), chairman of the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/">Senate Banking Committee</a> [official websites], the Democrats put forth their own proposal that included the judicial review language. Some observers had expressed concern that the Bush proposal would represent an unconstitutional delegation of the spending powers granted to Congress by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html">Article I of the US Constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  In a national referendum on Sunday, Ecuadorean voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution which consolidates and significantly broadens the powers held by leftist <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/modulos.asp?id=192">President Rafael Correa</a> [official website, in Spanish; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6187364.stm">BBC profile</a>]. The new <a href="http://www.eluniverso.com/2008/07/24/1212/1217/E8C064BD52EF420CAECDB655555BF60C.html">constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] gives the president the power to remove Congress in the middle of a four-year term, to control monetary policy, and to seek re-election for an additional term.  The constitution also includes plans to tighten control of Ecuador&#39;s vital mining and oil industries.  President Correa called the vote a &#39;historic victory,&#39; <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN2834023520080929">commenting</a> [Reuters report; <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/noticias.asp?noid=15905">official statement</a>, in Spanish], &quot;Today, Ecuador has decided on a new nation, the old structures are defeated.&quot;   AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gOIRAjeW-EXNpFLf306HkW23vKoQD93GC65G0">more</a>.

The success of Correa&#39;s referendum fulfills Correa&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-president-pledges-new.php">pledge to rewrite the country&#39;s constitution</a> [JURIST report] after his leftist coalition&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-ruling-coalition-wins-majority.php">landslide victor</a>y [JURIST report] in October 2007.  Correa&#39;s <a href="http://www.rafaelcorrea.com/plandegobierno.php">Alianza PAIS party</a> [official website, in Spanish] has a majority in the Constituent Assembly.   Critics continue to fear the 444-article constitution gives the president too much control over the economy and the judiciary, which would allow Correa to follow the example set by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile] in using the reform to further expand his powers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael Mukasey</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/September/08-opa-859.html">announced</a> [statement text] that he had named a prosecutor to determine whether criminal charges are warranted in connection with the removal of nine US attorneys, as recommended in a new <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] by investigators at the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">US Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website]. Mukasey said he had named <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/usattorney.html">Acting US Attorney Nora R. Dannehy</a> [official profile] of Connecticut to investigate the removals, as well as senior DOJ officials&#39; testimony about them, because he had concluded that the matter &quot;would be best overseen by an attorney outside Main Justice.&quot; Although the report by the DOJ Offices of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig">Inspector General</a> and <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opr/">Professional Responsibility</a> [official websites] &quot;dispelled many of the most disturbing allegations&quot; arising from the firings, Mukasey said, it made clear that the removals were &quot;haphazard, arbitrary and unprofessional.&quot; The attorney general continued: <blockquote>It is true, as the report acknowledges, that an Administration is entitled to remove presidential appointees, including U.S. Attorneys, for virtually any reason or no reason at all. But the leaders of the Department owed it to those who served the country in those capacities to treat their careers and reputations with appropriate care and dignity. And the leaders of the Department owed it to the American people they served to conduct the public&#39;s business in a deliberate and professional manner. The Department failed on both scores.<br /><br />Today&#39;s report is an important step toward acknowledging what happened, and holding the responsible officials to proper account. I hope the report provides a measure of relief to those U.S. Attorneys whose reputations were unfairly tainted by the removals and their aftermath. They did not deserve the treatment they received. </blockquote>The 392-page report concluded that there was &quot;significant evidence that political partisan considerations were an important factor&quot; in the 2006 dismissals. It further determined that former Attorney General <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/gonzales-bio.html">Alberto Gonzales</a> [White House profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/gonzales.php">news archive</a>] &quot;bears primary responsibility for the flawed U.S. Attorney removal process and the resulting turmoil&quot; and that he made a series of &quot;inaccurate and misleading&quot; statements regarding the removals. According to the report, <blockquote>[w]e also determined that the U.S. Attorneys were not given an opportunity to address concerns about their performance or provided the reasons for their removal, which led to widespread speculation about the true reasons for their removal, including that they were removed for improper partisan political reasons....<br /><br />We believe the primary responsibility for these serious failures rest with senior Department leaders &#8211; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty &#8211; who abdicated their responsibility to adequately oversee the process and to ensure that the reasons for removal of each U.S. Attorney were supportable and not improper. These removals were not a minor personnel matter &#8211; they were an unprecedented removal of a group of high-level Department officials that was certain to raise concerns if not handled properly. Yet, neither the Attorney General nor the Deputy Attorney General provided adequate oversight or supervision of this process.... Moreover, they and other Department officials are responsible for failing to provide accurate and truthful statements about the removals and their role in the process. </blockquote>The report called for further investigation, in part because the White House refused to provide certain requested documents and some former Bush administration officials would not agree to be interviewed. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jYuH3mAZbV0pXTznoxmZ2anGhojwD93GEK1G0">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/28/AR2008092801057.html?hpid=moreheadlines">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Monday&#39;s report is one of several internal assessments of the role politics played in DOJ hiring and firing practices. In July, the Inspector General and Professional Responsibility offices concluded that DOJ officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-report-says-officials-employed.php">made illegal hiring decisions</a> [JURIST report] based on applicants&#39; political and ideological beliefs. Following that report, Mukasey said the officials accused of politicizing the hiring process would likely <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/mukasey-against-prosecuting-doj.php">not be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] and that employees hired under the politicized process were not necessarily less qualified. An Inspector General report in June found that the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">improperly favored conservative candidates</a> [JURIST report] in assessing job and summer internship applications. Upon taking office last year, Mukasey promised that the DOJ would <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/mukasey-promises-greater-doj.php">maintain greater independence</a> from the Bush administration, and he later <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/mukasey-memo-limits-doj-case.php">advised senior DOJ officials</a> [JURIST reports] to limit discussions with the White House about ongoing investigations.

In June 2006, Eissa was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/rights-groups-slam-egypt-for-jailing.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to one year in prison for publishing a separate report critical of Mubarak, but an appeals court reduced the sentence to a $4,000 fine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The 2500-member People&#39;s Council of Turkmenistan Friday adopted a new constitution for <a href="http://www.turkmenistan.gov.tm/_eng">Turkmenistan</a> [official website; CIA <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.html#Govt">backgrounder</a>] envisioning a new multi-party political process and providing for limits on presidential power two years after the death of longtime autocrat <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6199021.stm">Saparmurat Niyazov</a> [BBC profile]. Turkmen leaders are hopeful that the changes in the country&#39;s charter would encourage investment in the Central Asian state, a leading regional producer of natural gas. Included in the new constitution are provisions for a five-year presidential term and a 125-seat elected legislature. Parliamentary elections are expected in December. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7638102.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Turkmenistan gained its independence upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Last year it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">cited</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/index.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> (IHF) [advocacy website] for widespread interference in judicial affairs, using torture, and suppressing political opposition, media, and civil society.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] More than 30 US pastors planned to <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=4690">preach about the &quot;moral qualifications&quot; of political candidates</a> [news release] Sunday, challenging <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=161131,00.html">federal tax laws</a> [IRS backgrounder] that prohibit tax-exempt entities from engaging in political campaigns. The conservative <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org">Alliance Defense Fund</a> (ADF) [advocacy website] recruited the pastors as part of its <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/issues/religiousfreedom/churchandstate.aspx?cid=4491">Pulpit Initiative</a> [ADF materials], which the group says is &quot;designed to protect the First Amendment rights of pastors in the pulpit.&quot; The restriction originated with a 1954 amendment to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000501----000-.html">tax code</a> [25 USC 501(c)(3) text], which defines a tax-exempt organization, in part, as one that &quot;does not participate in, or intervene in ... any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.&quot; In a <a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/userdocs/Pulpit_initiative_white_%20Paper.pdf">white paper</a> [PDF text] about the initiative, ADF said it <blockquote>believes that the Johnson amendment is unconstitutional in restricting the expression of sermons delivered from the pulpits of churches. This initiative is designed to return freedom to the pulpit by allowing pastors to speak out on the profound and important issues of the day.</blockquote><a href="http://www.au.org/">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a> [advocacy website] is promising to <a href="http://www.au.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr001=p61safsyk6.app5b&abbr=pr&page=NewsArticle&id=10051&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1241">report the pastors</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.irs.gov">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website], calling tax exemption a privilege that is subject to limitations. An IRS spokesman said the agency is aware of the ADF&#39;s plans and will &quot;take action as appropriate.&quot; The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/us/politics/26preach.html?em">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=181570,00.html">announced a program</a> [press release] to educate organizations about the restriction on political campaigning, noting that tax-exempt entities may take positions on political issues and advocate or oppose ballot initiatives and legislation under some circumstances. In 2000, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200005/99-5097a.txt">affirmed</a> [opinion text] a district court <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/branch_ministries.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] upholding the constitutionality of the restriction on political campaigning by tax-exempt organizations. In that case, a church challenged the revocation of its tax exemption for placing newspaper advertisements that implored Christians to vote against Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. The court rejected the church&#39;s arguments that its rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First and Fifth Amendments</a> [text] were violated, finding that the IRS had neither substantially burdened the church&#39;s free exercise rights nor singled out the church for prosecution.

The EC made the ruling after a challenge to the deals brought by radio broadcasting company <a href="http://www.rtlgroup.com/">RTL Group</a> [corporate website], in which it sought the ability to make multinational use agreements with a single rights holder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A judge for the <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] ruled Friday that the US Army will be able to complete its shipment of chemical waste from a location in western Indiana to Port Arthur, Texas, where the material will be incinerated.  The <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a> [advocacy website] and other citizen groups had filed the lawsuit in an attempt to block the Army from hauling the neutralized remains of the Cold-War era chemical weapon called VX.  The groups had argued that the Army characterized the material, also called hydrolysate, as having less of an amount of VX and other toxic byproducts than it actually did.  Chief Judge Larry McKinney held that the waste being shipped was not a munition or chemical agent, and rejected the argument that the Army had not fully considered the risk of shipping the material across the country.  Most of the 1,513,994 gallons of the waste had <a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-26-06.asp">already been shipped</a> [Environmental News report] and the last portion had left the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/newport.htm">Newport Chemical Depot</a> [globalsecurity backgrounder] in Indiana on September 4.  A spokesman for the <a href="http://www.cwwg.org/">Chemical Weapons Working Group</a> [official website] said the groups would not appeal the ruling since the shipment was essentially complete.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jMZ47BnSAgZBIOQyx732K935jemAD93E38JG4">more</a>. <br /><br />The destruction of the VX nerve agent began in May 2005, in accordance with the requirements of the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/documents-reports/document-details/dam-detail/?tx_damfrontend_pi1[showUid]=6357&tx_damfrontend_pi1[backPid]=900">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [text, PDF; US CWC official <a href="http://www.cwc.gov/">website</a>].  <a href="http://www.opcw.org/nc/about-opcw/member-states/?tx_opcwmemberstate_pi1[sortField]=0&tx_opcwmemberstate_pi1[sortReverse]=0&tx_opcwmemberstate_pi1[pointer]=3">Over 180 nations</a> [OPCW list] have signed on to the Convention since it entered into force in 1997. Under the Convention, banned weapons, including nerve and mustard gases, had to be destroyed by June 2007, though countries could apply for a five-year extension.

Hasan described legal aid as a constitutional right and in the interest of the nation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/7247887E88BB6AE7882574D3007D1157/$file/0717370.pdf?openelement">upheld</a> [decision, PDF] a San Francisco city ordinance passed in July 2006 that assists in the health care of nearly 73,000 uninsured workers and residents. The <a href="http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14131&sid=5">San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance</a> [text] requires all &quot;covered employers&quot; to pay up to a certain amount of medical care for certain employees. In November 2006, the <a href="http://www.ggra.org/content.asp?menuid=1243">Golden Gate Restaurant Association</a> (GGRA) [advocacy website] filed a complaint against the city, complaining that the ordinance was preempted by section 514(a) of the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/usc_sup_01_29_10_18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [text], which says that ERISA provisions supersede any state law relating to any employee benefit plan governed by ERISA. A district court judge in December agreed, entering <a href="http://www2a.cdc.gov/phlp/docs/Golden-Gate-Restaurant-Association_v_San-Francisco.pdf">judgment</a> [text, PDF] for GGRA. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding:<blockquote>[T]he Ordinance does not regulate benefits or charges for benefits provided by ERISA plans. Its only influence is on the employer who, because of the Ordinance, may choose to make its required health care expenditures to an ERISA plan rather than to the City...The [Ordinance&#39;s] spending requirements do not establish an ERISA plan; nor do they have an impermissible connection with employers&#39; ERISA plans, or make an impermissible reference to such plans.</blockquote>The ordinance also implements a Health Access Plan (HAP) to allow uninsured San Francisco residents to obtain health care from certain participating city hospitals and clinics, which was unchallenged by GGRA. The <span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/30/BA5K138P3T.DTL">more</a>. <br /><br />In January 2007, a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/061840.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-erisa.php">report</a>] that ERISA preempted the <a href="http://www.retail-leaders.org/new/resources/Maryland%20Law.pdf">Maryland Fair Share Health Care Fund Act</a> [text, PDF], which required Wal-Mart to spend the equivalent of eight percent of each individual store&#39;s payroll on employee health insurance. <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/bio.htm">Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler</a> [official profile] said in April that Maryland would not challenge that decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of news organizations filed a lawsuit in federal district court Monday to challenge the constitutionality of a Minnesota <a href="https://webrh12.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/laws/?year=2008&type=0&Chapter&id=244.#a2">statute</a> [text] restricting access to polling places. The Associated Press and several television networks brought suit in <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website], alleging that the law violates their rights under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment ">First Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder] and asking the court to enjoin its enforcement as applied to exit polling. The statute, titled &quot;Lingering near polling place,&quot; prohibits anyone other than an election official or prospective voter from standing within 100 feet of a building that houses a polling place. An <a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=204C.06">earlier version of the law</a> [text], which was amended in April, applied within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place, defined as &quot;the room or area where voting is occurring.&quot; An attorney for the news organizations said the law would prevent exit polling &quot;with any kind of accuracy and reliability,&quot; describing the restriction as the broadest of its kind in the country. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i6eABBeGH60LEASF9u3MS72q76ewD93GMUKO0">more</a>. From Minneapolis, the <em>Star Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/29909699.html?elr=KArksUUUU">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Congressional Research Service performed a <a href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/22683.pdf">legal analysis</a> [text, PDF] after the 2000 presidential election, when media had projected that Vice President Al Gore had won Florida before the polls had actually closed.  The study group concluded that Congress could not constitutionally prohibit exit polling, and the analysis suggested that &quot;Congress, could, however, ban voter solicitation within a certain distance from a polling place, and might be able to include exit polling within such a ban.&quot; A number of federal courts have struck down <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/handbook/c08p06.html">restrictions on exit polling</a> [RCFP backgrounder], including a Minnesota statute that prohibited reporters from questioning voters about ballot issues.
