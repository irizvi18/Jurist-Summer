		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Japanese authorities on Friday indicted a New Zealand anti-whaling activist in connection with boarding a Japanese whaling vessel as part of an anti-whaling protest in the antarctic seas. <a href="http://www.kensatsu.go.jp/kakuchou/tokyo/tokyo.shtml">Tokyo District Public Prosecutors</a> [official website, in Japanese] are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hbsFQi9NRCRAFsRQfj438hRfFiBgD9EQUAO00">bringing five charges</a> [AP report] against Captain Pete Bethune - trespassing, assault, illegal possession of a knife, destruction of property, and obstruction of business. Bethune&#39;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/world/asia/03japan.html">charges</a> [NYT report] stem from boarding the Shanon Maru II, a Japanese whaling vessel, in response to a January 6 collision with the anti-whaling vessel, the Ady Gil, which he captained. As a result of the collision, the bow of the Ady Gil was sheared off, and the crew was rescued by another ship. On February 15, Bethune allegedly approached the Shanon Maru II ship on a jet ski, cut through anti-boarding netting surrounding the ship, boarded the ship, and then presented its captain with a bill for $3 million in damage done to his ship. He was taken into custody and returned to Tokyo where he was arrested by the Japanese Coast Guard. The <a href="http://www.seashepherd.org/">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a> [advocacy website], of which Bethune is a member, has <a href="http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-100401-2.html">criticized</a> [press release] the indictment, saying the &quot;charges are bogus&quot; and that the group &quot;questions the credibility of the entire Japanese judicial system for entertaining such absurdities.&quot; The group claims that Bethune is being held for &quot;purely political reasons&quot; in order set an example for anti-whaling activists. Bethune faces a possible prison sentence of up to 15 years for both the assault and the business obstruction charges and could face up to three years for the trespassing charge. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling">Whaling</a> [Greenpeace backgrounder] is regulated by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/convention.pdf">1946 Whaling Convention</a> [text, PDF], and commercial whaling was outright banned in 1986 by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/index.htm">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) [official website]. The Japanese whalers <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1686486,00.html">defend</a> [TIME report] their whaling as scientific research because they collect data on the whale&#39;s age, diet, and birthing rate, before packaging and selling the meat. The Japanese mostly hunt for mincke and finback whales, but have begun to hunt humpback whales, which have reached sustainable levels since being placed on the endangered species list in 1963. The whaling issue has been contentious, especially in Australia where it is a major political issue causing <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/08/2839188.htm?section=justin">tensions</a> [ABC News report] with its neighbor New Zealand.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN rights official said Wednesday that immigrant workers entering Japan through government-run training programs <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9950&LangID=E">face widespread racism and discrimination</a> [press release], urging the country to increase immigrant protections. <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/rapporteur/">Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants</a> [official website] Jorge Bustamante interviewed immigrants, civil servants, and academics in the country during an investigation that uncovered <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100401a6.html">ongoing social and work-related discrimination</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kyodo News</span> report] against non-Japanese workers. The government-created <a href="http://www.jitco.or.jp/english/index.html">Japan International Training Cooperation Organization</a> (JITCO) [official website], which supervises multiple training programs, has brought in more than <a href="http://www.jitco.or.jp/english/overview/staticstics1.html">400,000 unskilled workers from 15 developing nations</a> [JITCO materials] to train the workers so they can return to their countries with work-related skills. Yet many of the migrants, who are mostly Asian, enter Japan and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34263&Cr=Migra&Cr1=">face exploitation</a> [UN News Centre report] in wages, health care, working conditions and child care. Opponents of the training programs urge the Japanese government to sign the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cmw.htm">International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families</a> [text] and to create laws to protect the human rights of immigrants in Japan. Bustamante will submit a report of his findings to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] later this year.<br /><br />Japan&#39;s human rights record received international attention earlier this year when ambassadors from eight countries met with Japanese <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/hatoyama/meibo/daijin/okada_e.html">Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada</a> [official profile] to urge Japan to sign an international treaty that would help <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/japan-urged-to-sign-international-child.php">prevent parental child abductions across borders</a> [JURIST report]. Japan is the only <a href="http://www.womensgroup.org/G-7REPOR.html">G-7 country</a> [backgrounder] that has not signed the 1980 <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text], which requires a country to return a child who has been &quot;wrongfully removed&quot; from his or her country of habitual residence. According to human rights groups, nearly 160,000 divorced or separated foreign and Japanese parents in Japan are <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091010f1.html">not allowed to see their children</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Japan Times</span> report] under the current child custody laws.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kenyan <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/parliament/">Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/news/april2010/2010010402.htm">unanimously approved</a> [press release] a <a href="http://www.coekenya.go.ke/images/stories/Resources/proposed_constitution_submitted_to_psc_by_coe_23_02_2010.pdf">draft constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The vote follows two days of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iPhX1mecO0eC1pULJkFnsLjHsKkwD9EQUED00">contentious debate</a> [AP report], though none of the many proposals for amendment passed, and the draft remained as introduced by the <a href="http://www.coekenya.go.ke/">Committee of Experts on Constitutional Review</a> [official website]. The draft includes several significant checks on presidential authority, including a requirement that presidential appointees face parliamentary confirmation and the removal of presidential appointment of judges. Members of Parliament receiving Cabinet positions will also have to relinquish their legislative seats. Final approval of the constitution will be determined via public referendum, to be held within 90 days.<br /><br />The first draft of the constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/kenya-committee-unveils-new-draft.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] in November. The changes are intended to reduce the widespread injustice throughout the country, and specifically address issues that led to violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">2007 presidential elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October, former UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/annan.php">news archive</a>] called for constitutional reform in Kenya before the next electoral cycle begins in 15 months. In 2007, tens of thousands of protesters took to Kenya&#39;s streets accusing <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] of election fraud after early opinion polls suggested rival <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/">Raila Odinga</a> [official website] was in the lead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigeria authorities on Thursday charged 20 individuals in connection with the recent sectarian violence in <a href="http://www.plateaustategov.org/">Plateau state</a> [official website] involving <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNCU46VYMVf0VzhqkKJUus45PrDAD9EAMDH84">killing of Christian villagers</a> [AP report] near the city of Jos. All 20 individuals have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6302H920100401">pleaded not guilty</a> [Reuters report] to five counts of arson, terrorism, killing, maiming, and possession of dangerous weapons. A federal court in Jos ordered the suspects to remain in custody until their trial on April 15. More than 160 suspects have been arrested in connection with the murders and authorities have stated that several are set to face similar charges. Those convicted could face the death penalty.<br /><br />Last month, 49 people, predominately Muslims, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/nigeria-police-to-charge-49-with-murder.php">charged with murder</a> [JURIST report] for the sectarian violence. The attacks were apparently in retaliation for the January violence between Muslims and Christians that left more than 300, mostly Muslims, dead. The city of Jos is located in an area of central Nigeria, which divides the predominately Muslim northern part of the country from the primarily Christian south. Authorities have indicated that the area is being patrolled by security forces to prevent further violence. In February, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/rights-group-urges-nigeria-acting.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] acting President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8510390.stm">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] to to &quot;tackle the culture of impunity&quot; in Nigeria. While HRW has called on Jonathan directly, other rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/nigeria-rights-group-urges-icc-to.php">petitioned international authorities</a> [JURIST report] to take action to prevent recurring rights abuses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/migrant/download/rights_based_approach.pdf">reiterated</a> [study, PDF; <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/migrant/download/rights_based_es_en.pdf">executive summary</a>, PDF] its call on the international community to take a &quot;rights based approach&quot; to international migration. The group said that 90 percent of the migration that occurs is driven by the search for employment and that countries should seek to provide &quot;conditions of freedom, dignity, equity and security,&quot; to migrant workers. It said that under the right conditions migrant workers, could provide benefits to both their countries of employment and origin, but that they currently face low wages, discrimination, and a lack of social or legal protection. The group touts its 2006 <a href="http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/migrant/download/multilat_fwk_en.pdf">Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration</a> [text, PDF] as a set of guidelines that governments should use to draft legislation protecting migrant workers.<br /><br />A number of countries around the world are facing problems with the treatment of international migrants. Earlier Wednesday, UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/migration/rapporteur/">Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants</a> [official website] Jorge Bustamante said that immigrant workers entering Japan through government-run training programs <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9950&LangID=E">face widespread racism and discrimination</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-rights-expert-urges-japan-to.php">report</a>], urging the country to increase immigrant protections. In January, the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] reported a recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">increase in xenophobic propaganda</a> [JURIST report] in Russia. Earlier that month, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/10/us/10detain.html?pagewanted=1&hp">reported</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-officials-concealed-immigrant-death.php">report</a>] that US officials have purposefully covered-up the deaths of some immigrants held in detention facilities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s Attorney General Anwar Mansoor announced his resignation Friday over controversy surrounding a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">order to investigate corruption allegations</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. Mansoor cited a <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pak-attorney-general-resigns/articleshow/5755001.cms">lack of cooperation</a> [PTI report] from Law Minister Babar Awan as a key factor in his decision, claiming the government was impeding him from following the Supreme Court&#39;s orders. Mansoor alleges that the Law Ministry <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD9ER02Q00">refused to turn over documents</a> [AP report] related to the investigation. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">threatened to imprison</a> [JURIST report] the head of Pakistan&#39;s corruption agency for failing to meet a 24-hour deadline to reopen several corruption cases, including cases against Zardari. In response, police <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-47325020100330">detained</a> [Reuters report] Director General of the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/msg_dg.htm">Federal Investigation Agency</a> [official website] Ahmed Riaz Sheikh, who was convicted of corruption eight years ago.<br /><br />Mansoor&#39;s announcement comes the same day that Pakistani lawmakers began weighing a constitutional bill that would greatly limit Zardari&#39;s powers, reversing the expansion of presidential powers under former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>]. Earlier this week, Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zadari. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf. The amnesty was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by Musharraf as part of a power-sharing accord allowing former Pakistani prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC profile] to return to the country despite <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/former-pakistan-pm-bhutto-facing.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] she had faced.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani lawmakers were weighing a constitutional bill Friday that would greatly limit the powers of <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website], reversing the expansion of presidential powers under former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>]. If passed by both houses of parliament, the 18th Amendment Bill would transfer presidential powers to the <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Cabinet/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNDE_1wkA6zeAMcwNFA388jPzdVvyA7rxwAicV1Mg%21%21/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwODdTNTAyRUlOMzQxTTEwOTQ%21/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/CabDivCL/division/secretary/prime+minister">office of the prime minister</a> [official website], effectively reserving the presidency as a figurehead. Among other changes, the <a href="http://news.oneindia.in/2010/04/02/zardarispowers-set-to-be-clipped-as-pak-govt-tables.html">president will no longer have the power</a> [ANI Report] to dissolve parliament, dismiss the prime minister, or appoint the chief of the armed forces. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7310028.stm">Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani</a> [BBC profile], who would be eligible for a third term under the legislation, stressed that the bill would <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?225693">strengthen Pakistani institutions</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Pak Tribune</span> report]. Zardari expressed hope that the bill would be <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?Id=1213">passed as soon as possible</a> [press release].<br /><br />The introduction of the bill comes amid controversy over reopening corruption investigations against Zardari. Earlier this week, Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zardari. The request by the NAB came one day after Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ordered the bureau to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">reopen all corruption investigations</a> [JURIST report] within 24 hours. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf. The Supreme Court&#39;s order is likely to increase tensions between the president and the judiciary, which have recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-supreme-court-challenges.php">clashed over court appointments</a> [JURIST report].

Moreno-Ocampo previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-prosecutor-accuses-officials-in.php">submitted a list of 20 suspects</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC, including senior political and business leaders, but he stated that this list is &quot;not binding.&quot; The prosecutor said he expects there to be two cases, each involving one to three people whom he will determine after reviewing the evidence to be the most responsible. He called upon all Kenyans to assist in the investigation, stating:<br /><blockquote><br />I will engage in this process with the Kenyans, with all the communities. This Court is their Court. Kenyan leaders - women, youth, tribal, judicial, political, religious, all have a role to play. I want to understand them and analyze how my office and all Kenyans can work together to prevent of [sic] future violence. The 50th anniversary of Kenya&#39;s independence is coming, it will be a historic opportunity to show an example of how one country overcomes violence.<br /></blockquote><br /><object style="height: 344px; width: 425px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLiZXT3z6rc"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NLiZXT3z6rc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Moreno-Ocampo stated that he plans to travel to Kenya in May to interview witnesses and made assurances that those witnesses will be protected from being exposed. He plans to &quot;finalize the bulk of the investigation&quot; during the remainder of this year.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-grants-prosecutors-request-to.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s request to proceed with a formal investigation of the post-election violence. His request marked the first time Moreno-Ocampo used his <em> proprio motu </em> power, which allows him  to initiate formal investigations upon authorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] following the 2007 elections led to violence that caused the deaths of more than 1,000 people and displacement of 500,000 others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] granted <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/alharamainorder33110.pdf">partial summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday in favor of an Islamic charity that claimed the federal government illegally wiretapped its conversations without a warrant. In its <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/islamic-charity-sues-to-shut-down-nsa.php">suit</a> [JURIST report; EFF <a href="http://www.eff.org/cases/al-haramain">materials</a>], the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haramain">Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation</a> [JURIST news archive] asked the court to admit a confidential <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] document accidentally sent to its lawyers to show that the government had illegally spied on the group. Judge Vaughn Walker denied this request and ruled instead that non-confidential information established that the government had illegally wiretapped conversations between the group and overseas parties in violation of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FISA">news archive</a>]. The court held that the government could not use the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive] to refuse to answer whether it had recorded conversations without a FISA warrant. The court gave the charity until April 16 to decide whether it wants to proceed with or dismiss remaining claims against the government.<br /><br />Al-Haramain <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/islamic-charity-seeks-summary-judgment.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] for partial summary judgment on the FISA claim last July. In February 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-denies-government-appeal.php">affirmed</a> the district court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-revives-islamic-charity.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] denying a government appeal to keep the NSA call log secret, despite its accidental release to Al-Haramain in 2004. The call log had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-rules-against.php">deemed a state secret</a> [JURIST report], but the decision required the government to allow the foundation to view the document. JURIST contributor Victor Comras said that Walker had done a &quot;truly remarkable job&quot; balancing <a href="/hotline/2009/03/judge-finds-proper-balance-between-due.php">national security and due process</a> [JURIST comment] in the case. Walker had previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-rules-executive-privilege.php">dismissed the suit</a> [JURIST report], finding that Al-Haramain lacked a cause of action because the state secrets privilege trumped procedural requirements under FISA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9d66ffa2-bae2-48cb-9dc2-ef71b75b44d2/2/doc/08-3947-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9d66ffa2-bae2-48cb-9dc2-ef71b75b44d2/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that Internet auction house <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aboutebay.html?_trksid=m40">eBay</a> [corporate website] is not required to actively monitor its website for the sale of counterfeit goods. The decision comes in a case brought by jeweler <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">Tiffany &amp; Company</a> [corporate website], alleging that eBay diluted its trademark by facilitating the sale of &quot;copycat&quot; Tiffany jewelry. EBay argued that it had no responsibility to take proactive steps against the sale of counterfeit items. Affirming a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rules-ebay-has-no-duty-to.php">decision</a> [JURIST report], the appeals court stated:<br /><blockquote><br />[Ebay] may lawfully use a plaintiff&#39;s trademark where doing so is necessary to describe the plaintiff&#39;s product and does not imply a false affiliation or endorsement by the plaintiff of the defendant. While a trademark conveys an exclusive right to the use of a mark in commerce in the area reserved, that right generally does not prevent one who trades a branded product from accurately describing it by its brand name, so long as the trader does not create confusion by implying an affiliation with the owner of the product.<br /></blockquote><br />While affirming that Ebay did not infringe Tiffany&#39;s trademark, the court remanded Tiffany&#39;s claim of false advertising.<br /><br />The Second Circuit ruling marks a dramatic contrast with recent rulings in Europe. In February, the <a href="http://www.ca-paris.justice.fr/index.php?rubrique=11016&ssrubrique=11051&article=14755">Paris District Court</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-rules-ebay-intentionally.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] eBay to pay <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton </a>(LVMH) [corporate website] 200,000 euros ($275,000) in damages for paying search engines to direct customers to counterfeit LVMH products. In a separate case in September, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] issued an advisory opinion <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ecj-advisory-opinion-finds-google-ad.php">against LVMH</a> [JURIST report] in its suit to collect damages from Google for Google&#39;s AdWords system, which allows companies and individuals to purchase advertising space when a user searches for a product or brand name. In 2008, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">ordered eBay to pay LVMH $63 million</a> [JURIST report] for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> and <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profiles] announced a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/obama-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-energy-security">comprehensive energy plan</a> [WH press release; DOI <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/2010_03_31_release.cfm">press release</a>] Wednesday that would introduce regulations to increase offshore drilling while tightening emissions and mileage standards on vehicles. The plan would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/03/31/31greenwire-obama-proposes-opening-vast-offshore-areas-to-74696.html?pagewanted=1">allow exploration</a> [NYT report] off the coasts of the mid-Atlantic and southeastern states and development in previously closed areas of the Gulf of Mexico. Obama stated:<br /><blockquote><br />I want to emphasize that this announcement is part of a broader strategy that will move us from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that relies on homegrown fuels and clean energy. And the only way this transition will succeed is if it strengthens our economy in the short term and the long term.  To fail to recognize this reality would be a mistake.<br /></blockquote><br />Congressman <a href="http://moran.house.gov/index.shtml">Jim Moran</a> (D-VA) [official website], Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, <a href="http://moran.house.gov/apps/list/press/va08_moran/OSDstatement2010.shtml">opposed the plan</a> [press release], arguing that &quot;[e]nabling more drilling, when these sources have yet to be exhausted, only feeds our economic dependence on fossil fuels when we should be moving more aggressively to cleaner, sustainable sources of energy.&quot;<br /><br />Last year, a panel for the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/dc-circuit-halts-offshore-drilling.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a Bush-era program that would have allowed drilling off the coast of Alaska because the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] had failed to carry out required studies. The ruling followed <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-administration-to-reverse-bush.php">plans</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration to reverse offshore drilling policies established by former president <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] at the end of his presidency. The Obama administration planned to extend the public comment period on the proposed five-year plan for offshore oil and gas development by 180 days, assembling a detailed report from DOI agencies on conventional and renewable offshore energy resources, holding four regional conferences to review these findings, and expediting renewable energy rule making.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] on Thursday called on leaders in <a href="http://www.republica-da-guine-bissau.org/index.php?id=1">Guinea-Bissau</a> [official website, in Portuguese] to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4467">respect the rule of law</a> [press release] and maintain constitutional order in the wake of a confrontation between the military and government in which the prime minister was detained and later released. A spokesperson for the secretary-general said:<blockquote>The Secretary-General is following with concern the military incidents in Guinea-Bissau involving the detention and subsequent release of the Prime Minister. He calls on the military and political leadership of Guinea-Bissau to resolve differences by peaceful means and to maintain constitutional order and ensure respect for the rule of law. He further underlines the need to avoid any risks to the gains made by Guinea-Bissau in its on-going peace consolidation efforts.<br /><br />The Secretary-General&#39;s Special Representative for Guinea Bissau, Mr. Joseph Mutaboba, is working closely with other international partners including the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union to continue to support national efforts to promote sustainable stability in the country.</blockquote>The secretary-general, <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website], and African regional partners have cooperated in efforts to resolve Guinea-Bissau&#39;s political turmoil in the past, signaling that this mechanism will again be employed. Concern for the rule of law has evolved from the country&#39;s long-standing political instability.<br /><br />Guinea-Bissau&#39;s military has officially <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63035R20100402">denied</a> [Reuters report] any attempt at a coup d&#39;etat, but on Thursday armed forces chief of staff Admiral Jose Zamora Induta was removed from office, and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior was taken into military custody. In March, the Security Council issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2010/sc9875.doc.htm">statement</a> [text] on the conflict in Guinea-Bissau, recognizing the importance of the work of the <a href="http://unogbis.unmissions.org/">UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau</a> (UNIOGBIS) and the <a href="http://www.un.org/peace/peacebuilding/">UN Peacebuilding Commission</a> [official websites] in resolving ongoing problems. The conflict between military and government highlights continuing tensions over the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5830298.ece">assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira</a> [<em>Times Online</em> report] in 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/sroot_eng.aspx?id=166">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>] on Thursday blamed foreign officials for the extensive irregularities that occurred during last year&#39;s disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Though admitting that fraud was widespread, Karzai <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/04/20104114296107225.html">accused</a> [Al Jazeera report] UN and EU representatives, particularly former deputy head of the UN-backed mission <a href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/about/staff/pgalbraith/">Peter Galbraith</a> [official profile], of attempting to influence vote counts and disseminating false information to media outlets in an effort to slander his campaign. He further alleged that electoral officials were <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100401/wl_sthasia_afp/afghanistanvoteuneufraud_20100401162738">offered bribes</a> [AFP report] by embassy representatives, though he did not specify which embassies were involved. Both the UN and EU declined to comment on the accusations.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the lower house of the Afghan Parliament <a href="http://www.parliament.af/pve/showdoc.aspx?Id=862">rejected</a> [press release] Karzai&#39;s proposal to require that all appointees to the UN-supported <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] be of Afghan citizenship. In November, Afghanistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/Default.asp?sect=4">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/karzai-declared-winner-of-afghanistan.php">declared Karzai the winner</a> [JURIST report] of the election after challenger <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1672882.stm">Abdullah Abdullah</a> [BBC profile] withdrew from the runoff election due to the his belief that the upcoming vote would not be free or fair. Karzai was originally declared to have secured over half the vote, avoiding a runoff, but this was challenged by the EEC in October when it <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/afghanistan-runoff-set-after-un-backed.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] a significant portion of Karzai&#39;s vote due to findings of fraud at 210 polling stations. Soon after the election was held in August, Abdullah <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/afghanistan-opposition-candidate.php">alleged widespread voter fraud</a> [JURIST report], filing more than 100 complaints with the ECC alleging ballot stuffing, inflated vote counts, and intimidation at the polls by Karzai supporters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula said Thursday that Kenya will no longer accept <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia+pirate">Somalian pirate cases</a> [JURIST news archive] to be tried in its courts. Wetangula stated that the large number of Somalian pirate cases referred to Kenya has <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=63137">overburdened</a> [KBC report] the country&#39;s judicial system and noted that the international community has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8599347.stm">not followed through</a> [BBC report] on its promises to support the country in adjudicating these cases. Additionally, <a href="http://www.attorney-general.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=89&Itemid=1">Attorney General Amos Wako</a> [official profile] noted the <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/Kenya-backtracks-on-pirates-deal-7989.html">lack of commitment</a> [Capital News report] by other countries in taking on piracy cases, leaving Kenya largely responsible.<br /><br />In January, the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] reported that 2009 marked the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">worst year for maritime piracy</a> [JURIST report] in six years. The information indicated that the total reported incidents of piracy reached 406, surpassing 400 for the first time since 2003. Earlier that month, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-prosecutors-charge-suspected-somali.php">filed a superseding indictment</a> [JURIST report] against alleged Somali pirate Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, claiming that he led the takeover of two additional ships. Muse pleaded not guilty to the charges. In November, Somali judge Mohamed Abdi Aware, known for jailing suspected pirates, human traffickers, and Islamist insurgents, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] while leaving a mosque in the Puntland city of Bossaso.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Obama administration issued new regulations Thursday tightening fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emission standards for new cars starting in 2012. The <a href="http://www.dot.gov/">Department of Transportation</a> (DOT) and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environment Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official websites] <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot5610a.htm">issued</a> [press release] a joint rule called the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/DOT/NHTSA/Rulemaking/Rules/Associated%20Files/CAFE-GHG_MY_2012-2016_Final_Rule.pdf">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) [text, PDF], which will require new cars to meet tougher standards by 2016. The CAFE standards will <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/DOT/NHTSA/Rulemaking/Rules/Associated%20Files/Final_Joint_TSD.pdf">require</a> [fact sheet, PDF] new automobiles to meet an estimated combined average mile per gallon (mpg) of 34.1 mpg and an estimated combined average emissions level of 250 grams of CO2 per mile by 2016. The standards will apply to cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles. The DOT and EPA estimate that over the lives of the 2016 model automobiles, the CAFE standards will save the average customer $3,000, will save the nation about 1.8 billion barrels of oil, and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about a billion tons. The DOT and EPA said the new standards are consistent with President Barack Obama&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/white-house-announces-national-vehicle.php">National Fuel Efficiency Policy</a> [JURIST report] announced last may, &quot;responding to the country&#39;s critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption.&quot;<br /><br />In December, the EPA announced a finding that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">greenhouse gases threaten</a> [JURIST report] public health and the environment. Those findings enabled the EPA to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF], which the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">gives the EPA authority</a> [JURIST report] to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by automobiles. In June, the EPA granted permission to California to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/epa-grants-california-request-to.php">enforce its own greenhouse gas emissions standards</a>. California had been <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/ca-waiver.htm">seeking permission</a> [EPA materials] from the EPA to set its own vehicle emission and greenhouse gas standards since 2005. The request was initially <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1514_epa-letter.pdf">denied</a> [letter, PDF] in December 2007, on the grounds that the regulations were aimed at addressing global climate change and that California was limited to &quot;address[ing] pollution problems that are local or regional.&quot; The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/epa-reconsiders-california-request-to.php">EPA reconsidered</a> [JURIST report] California&#39;s request last year after being <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Presidential_Memorandum_EPA_Waiver/">directed</a> [memorandum; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-allows-california-and-other.php">report</a>] by Obama to do so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/acdec/en/100331.pdf">denied</a> [judgment, PDF] an appeal by former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>] to postpone his war crimes trial. Karadzic appealed the trial date last month, claiming a February court ruling that increased the remuneration for his defense lawyers also gave him extra time to prepare for his case. Karadzic had claimed that he needed more time to read through more than 400,000 pages of documents turned over by the prosecution. In rejecting his argument, the appeals chamber of the ICTY said:<br /><blockquote><br />[We] are satisfied that the trial chamber took into account all the relevant factors including the February 2010 decision on the staffing of Karadzic&#39;s defense team and possible remedies for the period when his team was understaffed. As a result, the Trial Chamber made no error in assessing that further postponement of the trial was not justified. Karadzic has failed to demonstrate that the Trial Chambers abused its discretion in reaching this conclusion.<br /></blockquote><br />The Appeals Chamber ordered that the trial <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10370">resume on April 13</a> [press release], while Karadzic had requested that proceedings be delayed until June 17.<br /><br />The ICTY recently heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">opening statements</a> [JURIST report] in Karadzic&#39;s war crimes trial on charges related to crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Karadzic claims that attacks against Bosnian Muslims were &quot;staged,&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">denying</a> [JURIST reports] any involvement in war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. In February, Karadzic appeared before the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/karadzic-claims-documents-evidence.php">seeking access to documents</a> [JURIST report] he claimed showed evidence of weapons smuggling to Bosnian Muslims. Also in February, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-dismisses-karadzic-appeal-of-court.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Karadzic&#39;s imposition of a court-appointed defense lawyer, claiming the right to legal assistance of his own choosing. Karadzic is defending himself against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 counts</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide and murder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The German government is considering accepting detainees held at the US military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], according to <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,686168,00.html">interviews</a> [text] published this week by <em>Der Spiegel</em> magazine. German <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/EN/">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official profile], Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle revealed a possible plan to accept the transfer of three inmates to Germany. While Germany has historically supported the closure of Guantanamo, the former interior minister <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/04/01/Germany-open-to-accepting-Gitmo-inmates/UPI-79711270148085/">opposed</a> [UPI report] accepting detainees, citing security grounds. The new proposal, which may see detainees in Germany in the near future, has drawn <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,686937,00.html">criticism</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Der Spiegel</span> report] from members of the German coalition government.<br /><br />Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) announced that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">three detainees had been transferred to the country of Georgia</a> [JURIST report]. Also in March, two <a href="/currentawareness/uighurs.php">Uighur</a> [JURIST news archive] Guantanamo detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-2-uighur-guantanamo.php">transferred to Switzerland</a>. The previous month, four detainees were transferred to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania and Spain</a> [JURIST report]. In December, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/bulgaria-to-consider-accepting.php">Bulgaria</a> [JURIST report] expressed a willingness to accept detainees. Other European countries that have accepted transfers include <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a> [JURIST reports]. The Obama administration failed to meet its January <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">deadline</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison after running into several hurdles, including opposition from members of Congress and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=B6832638-1">Minister of the Environment Jim Prentice</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=714D9AAE-1&news=B1DDFE4D-5147-46F9-BA97-BA1BDDC3B7A6">proposed</a> [press release] a new set of <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/Content/B/1/D/B1DDFE4D-5147-46F9-BA97-BA1BDDC3B7A6/611164-E%20%28Final%29%20Version%20II.pdf">regulations</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=714D9AAE-1&news=7DFF93CB-5188-4B89-83E6-AC8B3022C738">backgrounder</a>] aimed to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted from vehicles. The new standards will apply to cars and light truck models starting in 2011. The standards will differ based on the footprints of cars (measured in square meters) and how many vehicles were sold in the previous year. According to the Canadian government:<br /><blockquote><br />These new regulations would deliver certainty to the automotive industry and will require significant technological improvements to vehicles to reduce GHG emissions. As a result of the proposed regulations, it is projected that the average GHG emission performance of new vehicles of the 2016 model year will be about 25% lower than the vehicles that were sold in Canada in 2008. These improvements are expected to result in a cumulative reduction of 92 Mt CO2e in GHG emissions over the lifetime of the 2011-2016 model year vehicles sold in Canada.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=FD9B0E51-1">Environment Canada</a> [official website] will make emissions credits available for the auto industry in order to help meet the overall environmental goals of the country while still providing the industry with flexibility.<br /><br />The new standards are designed to coincide with the US standards established under the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/DOT/NHTSA/Rulemaking/Rules/Associated%20Files/CAFE-GHG_MY_2012-2016_Final_Rule.pdf">Corporate Average Fuel Economy</a> (CAFE) [text, PDF] regulations, also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/obama-administration-issues-vehicle.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] Thursday. In December, the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] announced a finding that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/epa-rules-greenhouse-gases-threaten.php">greenhouse gases threaten</a> [JURIST report] public health and the environment. Those findings enabled the EPA to take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF], which the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">gives the EPA authority</a> [JURIST report] to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by automobiles. In June, the EPA granted permission to California to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/epa-grants-california-request-to.php">enforce its own greenhouse gas emissions standards</a> [JURIST report]. California had been <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/ca-waiver.htm">seeking permission</a> [EPA materials] from the EPA to set its own vehicle emission and greenhouse gas standards since 2005, but was initially <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1514_epa-letter.pdf">denied</a> [letter, PDF]. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/epa-reconsiders-california-request-to.php">EPA reconsidered</a> [JURIST report] California&#39;s request last year after being <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Presidential_Memorandum_EPA_Waiver/">directed</a> [memorandum; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-allows-california-and-other.php">report</a>] by the Obama administration to do so.

At a joint press conference with Turkmenistan&#39;s President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, Ban said that he, &quot;called on the government to fulfill all obligations under international human rights law and the many treaties to which it is a signatory.&quot; Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34268&Cr=central+asia&Cr1=">arrived in Turkmenistan</a> [UN News Centre report] Thursday, his first stop on his week-long tour of Central Asia, which will also include visits to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan as a chance to discuss regional cooperation, nuclear non-proliferation, climate change, and development.  <br /><br />Turkmenistan has been undergoing a transitional phase as it attempts to emerge from its authoritarian past as part of the Soviet Union. The country <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/turkmenistan-adopts-new-constitution.php">adopted a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, which envisioned a new multi-party political process and provided for limits on presidential power.

Turkmenistan gained its independence upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has been cited by the <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/index.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] for widespread interference in judicial affairs, using torture, and suppressing political opposition, media, and civil society. The Democratic Party of Turkmenistan (DPT), which was previously called the Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR, is the country&#39;s ruling and only legal political party.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia </a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv1130-153">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] as moot 105 <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> petitions of non-citizen former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees who are no longer in US custody. Judge Thomas Hogan wrote that in deciding the case, the court was answering one of the questions left open by the Supreme Court&#39;s 2008 decision in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [JURIST report]: &quot;what happens to a Guantanamo detainee&#39;s <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> claim once he is transferred or released.&quot; The former detainees had changed their petitions from seeking release from US custody to asking that the US intervene to seek their release from foreign custody or lift limitations placed on them by foreign states, or withdraw their prior determination as enemy combatants. Hogan ruled:<br /><blockquote><br />Upon consideration of the multiple briefs filed by the parties, the 105 habeas petitions, as well as the entire record herein, the Court finds that the District Court no longer has jurisdiction over Petitioners&#39; habeas petitions. Petitioners are no longer in United States custody and fail to demonstrate that they suffer from collateral consequences of their prior detention that the Court can remedy. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss their habeas claims as moot.<br /></blockquote><br />Hogan added that petitioners&#39; &quot;alleged injuries are either speculative or beyond the Court&#8217;s authority to redress.&quot;<br /><br />The US government has prevailed in 12 of the 46 <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> cases <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=US+District+Court+for+the+District+of+Columbia+habeas+corpus">decided</a>  [JURIST news archive] in the DC District Court. Former Guantanamo detainees have been transferred to countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>,  <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, Afghanistan, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algeria</a>,  and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a> [JURIST reports]. The Obama administration failed to meet its <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">deadline</a> [JURIST report] of closing the prison by January 2010 after running into several hurdles, including opposition from members of Congress and  the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-suspend-guantanamo-detainee.php">suspension of detainee transfers to Yemen</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for an Algerian national detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] on Monday filed an emergency <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Belbacha-stay-motion-4-5-10.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to block the detainee&#39;s transfer to his home country. Petitioner Ahmed Belbacha renewed his request for an administrative stay of a February court order mandating the transfer. The motion alleges that flaws in an earlier court order and new circumstances in the case motivate a ruling in favor of Belbacha:<br /><blockquote><br />With respect, the Court seriously misapprehended Mr. Belbacha&#39;s earlier request for an administrative stay. In addition, a fresh development &#8211; an announcement on Friday that the Attorney General will meet this week with the Algerian Minister of Justice &#8211; underscores the need for an administrative stay. As this Court recently recognized, the &quot;potential harm&quot; that Mr. Belbacha faces if he is transferred to Algeria is &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;substantial.&quot; The case for an administrative stay is especially strong because there is substantial question as to the Court&#39;s jurisdiction to issue the February 4 Order.<br /></blockquote><br />Belbacha has argued that he will be subjected to abuse and criminal prosecution if returned to Algeria, a situation that his counsel argues necessitates the emergency court order. Belbacha relies on the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [JURIST report] that Guantanamo detainees have a right to challenge their imprisonment, which resulted in a spate of detainee suits against the federal government. <br /><br />Last month, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] in the case known as <u>Kiyemba II</u>, in which the court was asked to consider issues surrounding the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Lawyers for four Chinese Muslim <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uighur+guantanamo">Uighurs</a> [JURIST news archive] detained at Guantanamo were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-seek.php">appealing</a> [JURIST report] an April <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200904/05-5487-1174543.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/dc-circuit-rules-courts-cannot-prevent.php">report</a>] by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Columbia Circuit, which held that US courts cannot prevent the government from transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries on the grounds that detainees may face prosecution or torture in the foreign country. The case is separate from a case the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-sends-uighur-case-back-to.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] to the DC circuit court earlier last month, known as <u>Kiyemba I</u>. The US government has prevailed in 12 of the 46 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=US+District+Court+for+the+District+of+Columbia+habeas+corpus"><span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> cases decided</a> [JURIST news archive] in the DC District Court since the <u>Boumediene</u> ruling.

The trials, originally set to resume Tuesday, were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8604509.stm">postponed</a> [BBC report] due to an ongoing case in the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20COURT%20OF%20APPEAL%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Court of Appeals</a> [official website], which is examining the legality of the court-martials. Fonseka faces two separate court-martials, charging him with participating in politics while in uniform and with improperly awarding army procurement contracts. Fonseka maintains that the allegations are a politically motivated effort to bar him from participating in the nation&#39;s upcoming elections. Fonseka is scheduled for a hearing before the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on April 26, where he will challenge his detention.<br /><br />Fonseka was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-military-police-arrest.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by the military in February after losing presidential elections held the previous month.

Sarath Nanda Silva, who retired from the Sri Lankan Supreme Court last year, accused the government of using the military justice system to prevent Fonseka from participating in the upcoming elections, and of violating Fonseka&#39;s civil rights. Silva also said that Fonseka&#39;s arrest was made in violation of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Introduction.htm">constitution</a> [text].

DHS <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] said the new system will apply to all air carriers with international flights to the US, and is more effecting at stopping terrorist threats:<br /><blockquote><br />These new measures utilize real-time, threat-based intelligence along with multiple, random layers of security, both seen and unseen, to more effectively mitigate evolving terrorist threats. The terrorist threat to global aviation is a shared challenge and ensuring aviation security is a shared responsibility. I commend our many partners around the world who have taken steps to increase their own security measures through deployment of new technology, enhanced information sharing and stronger standards to keep air travel safe.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security-racial-justice/dhs-announces-changes-airline-screening-program">praised the new policy</a> [press release] as a move away from racial profiling, calling it a step in the right direction.<br /><br />US President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">called for stricter airport security</a> [JURIST report] in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-files-charges-in-attempted-detroit.php">failed bombing attempt</a> [JURIST report] by Nigerian citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=umar+farouk">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [JURIST news archive] in December. Civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] temporary screening measures that automatically called for extra scrutiny of passengers traveling from certain Islamic countries, calling them unconstitutional. In January, European officials told the US that they would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/eu-countries-refuse-us-request-for.php">not install body scanning technology</a> [JURIST report] at airports until the countries have studied the effectiveness, safety, and threat to privacy of such devices. However, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/uk-pm-announces-increased-airport.php">UK would improve security</a> [JURIST report] using several measures, including body scanners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Serbian <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor</a> [official website] announced Friday that it has issued an international warrant for the arrest of alleged Nazi war criminal and naturalized American citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=peter+egner">Peter Egner</a> [JURIST news archive]. Head Serbian prosecutor Vladmir Vukcevic has accused Egner of having been a member of <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005130">Einsatzgruppe</a> [USHMM backgrounder], an SS paramilitary outfit alleged to be responsible for the deaths of more than 17,000 Serbian Jews and other minorities in Belgrade during the German occupation of Serbia in World War II. Egner admitted to federal officials in 2007 that he had been a member of the squad, which is alleged to have rounded up women and children in specially modified vans to gas them with carbon monoxide. He is currently fighting efforts by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-continues-efforts.php">revoke his citizenship</a> [JURIST report], which would allow the government to extradite him to Serbia to stand trial on numerous counts of war crimes.<br /><br />Vukcevic announced in April that he would ask the US for Egner&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-to-seek-us-extradition-of-nazi.php">extradition</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2008, Serbian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-nazi-guards-living-in-us-may.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that they were gathering evidence for a case against Egner. Earlier that same week, the DOJ filed a <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/seattle911/library/alleged_nazi_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] seeking to revoke Egner&#39;s US citizenship. Egner became a US citizen in 1966 but failed to disclose his Nazi service on his citizenship application. The DOJ argued that he was ineligible for citizenship both because of his service and because he concealed that information on his application.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German <a href="http://www.bmj.bund.de/enid/Minister/Sabine_Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger_-_Federal_Minister_of_Justice_14e.html">Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger</a> [official profile] on Sunday announced plans to enact a law to increase protections for journalists using information obtained from government sources. Under <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/index.html">section 353b of the German Penal Code</a> [text], public officials who release state information can be punished by up to five years in prison. While the current law does not specifically target members of the press, prosecutors have used the law to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5430788,00.html">search and confiscate</a> [DW report] information from journalists even if they are not suspected of wrong-doing. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger indicated that the proposed law would allow journalists to act as an important check on the government without fear of interference. The law appears to have broad support within the government and negotiations on the law are expected to begin next month. <br /><br />Germany joins Iceland and the US on the list of countries that have recently proposed legislation meant to increase freedom of the press. In February, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/vefur/uppla.html">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] began <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iceland-parliament-considering-new.php">considering measures</a> [JURIST report] aimed at increasing protections for journalists and promoting freedom of speech and transparency in government. Last December, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-judiciary-committe-approves.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would protect journalists&#39; abilities to shield sources in federal court proceedings. <a href="http://www.rsf.org/index.php?page=rubrique&id_rubrique=2">Reporter&#39;s Without Borders</a> (RWB) [advocacy website] ranked Iceland number one in <a href="http://www.rsf.org/en-classement1001-2009.html">press freedom in 2009</a> [2009 rankings], while ranking Germany eighteenth and the US twentieth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Equatorial Guinea court on Monday sentenced seven Nigerians to 12 years in prison for a 2009 attack on the presidential palace. Court president Antonio Pascual Ojo Ebobo found the Nigerians <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j5XmbNe-pLKLTdGCigTcQmysVJXA">guilty of terrorism</a> [AFP report] and said they would be fined 149 million CFA francs (USD $310,000). The Nigerians, along with 11 Equatorial Guineans, were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8605113.stm">arrested</a> [BBC report] after a February 2009 attack on Equatorial Guinea&#39;s presidential palace in Malabo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian criminal court on Sunday ordered 16 members of the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=24017">released on bail</a> [MB press release], including deputy chairman Mahmoud Ezzat and spokesperson Essam al-Erian. The members of MB, which has been banned in <a href="/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive], were arrested in February and charged with plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government. The MB has called those charges &quot;concocted.&quot; The Egyptian government has often used the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.fidh.org/THE-EMERGENCY-LAW-IN-EGYPT">emergency laws</a> [FIDH backgrounder; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Egypt+emergency+laws">JURIST news archive</a>] to arrest and indefinitely detain individuals it considered a threat to state security. This includes the MB, which the Egyptian government has accused of trying to create an Islamic theocracy through violence. There has been no indication of when the 16 individuals will be released.<br /><br />In the past, Egypt has also used the emergency laws extensively against other opposition parties. In July, the trial of 26 individuals with alleged ties to Hezbollah was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/egypt-to-try-26-hezbollah-linked-terror.php">transferred to a court</a> [JURIST report] established under the emergency laws. In February 2009, a military court utilized the laws during a trial in which it <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-court-imprisons-opposition-leader.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] opposition leader Magdy Ahmed Hussein to two years in prison. The emergency laws have been in effect continuously since the 1981 assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/egypt-extends-emergency-laws-despite.php">renewed</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2008/06/last-extension-of-emergency-law-in.php">op-ed</a>] most recently in May 2008. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] sharply <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/egypt-emergency-laws-extension-shows.php">criticized the renewal</a> [JURIST report], saying the move showed &quot;contempt for the rule of law.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Rwandan <a href="http://supremecourt.gov.rw/en/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled on Saturday that the plea for release by Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) rebel leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3786883.stm">Laurent Nkunda</a> [BBC profile] can only be heard by a military court. According to Nkunda&#39;s counsel, Aime Bokanga, the court held that since the military was responsible for Nkunda&#39;s detention, a military court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE632052">must hear his case</a> [Reuters report] for release. Bokanga expressed disappointment at the ruling, saying that the Supreme Court should have declared Nkunda&#39;s detention illegal. The case is expected to be transferred next week. Nkunda is the leader of the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), a rebel group operating in the eastern DRC province of Nord-Kivu. According to Nkunda&#39;s counsel, he is being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLK253788._CH_.2400">held illegally</a> [Reuters report] without charge, and has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8544007.stm">promised</a> [BBC report] to bring the case to the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/en/">African Court of Human and Peoples&#39; Rights</a> [official website] if redress cannot be found in a Rwandan court.<br /><br />Last April, a Rwandan court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/rwanda-court-rejects-detained-congo.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a similar lawsuit seeking Nkunda&#39;s release from custody. Nkunda was apprehended by Rwandan authorities in last January near the DRC border after a joint DRC-Rwandan military operation to capture him and root out Rwandan Hutu rebels operating in the DRC. Nkunda faces an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/captured-congo-rebel-leader-faces.php">uncertain legal future</a> [JURIST report], with the DRC government having called on Rwanda to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7847639.stm">extradite Nkunda to DRC</a> [BBC report] where he would face charges for atrocities allegedly committed by forces under his command. Another possibility for Nkunda is extradition to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] in The Hague. The ICC has <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icc-unseals-arrest-warrant-for-congo.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] and prepared a case against his deputy in the CNDP, <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0104/Related+Cases/ICC+0104+0206/ICC+0104+0206.htm">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [ICC materials], for war crimes committed in the DRC, including the recruitment and use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=child+soldiers">child soldiers</a> [JURIST news archive]. Nkunda has repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/congo-militia-leader-denies-war-crimes.php">denied allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] against him and the CNDP.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday took the stand at his trial and called for the case against him to be dismissed for lack of evidence. Khodorkovsky and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">charged with embezzling</a> [JURIST report] USD $25 billion worth of oil produced by their <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">Yukos</a> [JURIST news archive] oil company. Defense lawyers for Khodorkovsky contend that prosecutors have no evidence to support the charges and that they have failed to show how the men could have embezzled the profits but continued covering company expenses and expanding oil production. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are currently serving eight-year prison sentences after being <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 on fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from an attempt to embezzle and strip Yukos of valuable assets. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev have <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/khodorkovsky-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the current charges, and they face up to 20 additional years in prison if convicted.<br /><br />Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition to former Russian president and current <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>]. Last month Khodorkovsky <a href="http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2010-03-03/5_represii.html?mthree=9">criticized</a> [text, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">report</a>] Russia&#39;s justice system as an &quot;assembly line&quot; that inevitably finds the government&#39;s political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The upper house of the Afghan parliament, the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/pme/Default.aspx">Meshrano Jirga</a>, on Saturday backed a decree allowing the president to appoint all of the members of the <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official websites]. The decree was issued in February by <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/index_eng.aspx">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] following the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Previously, the ECC was comprised of three foreign members appointed by the UN and two Afghan citizens - one appointed by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.af/">Supreme Court</a> and another by the <a href="http://www.aihrc.org.af/English/">Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission</a> [official websites]. The decree requires that all members be Afghan citizens and gives the president the power to appoint all five members. On Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/PVE/Default.aspx">Wolesi Jirga</a> [official website], the lower house of the Afghan parliament, <a href="http://www.parliament.af/pve/showdoc.aspx?Id=862">voted overwhelmingly</a> [press release] to veto Karzai&#39;s decree. The upper house <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100403/ts_nm/us_afghanistan_election">refused to vote</a> [Reuters report] on the issue, however, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303338304575156092705604682.html">touching off a debate</a> [WSJ report] as to what is now required to prevent the decree from being enforced under the <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#chapterfive">Afghan Constitution</a> [text]. Western diplomats claim that it must be vetoed by the Meshrano Jirga as well, and others add that the veto must be signed by the president. Additionally, some lawmakers have argued that electoral law cannot be changed within a year of an election. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for September.<br /><br />The rejection of Karzai&#39;s decree has been seen as further evidence that he is facing a much more assertive parliament in his second term. The Wolesi Jirga <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-lower-house-rejects-karzai.php">rejected more than a dozen</a> of Karzai&#39;s cabinet nominees in January before <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghan-parliament-backs-karzai-justice.php">finally accepting</a> [JURIST reports] his nominee for the justice ministry. On Thursday, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/afghanistan-president-accuses-un-eu.php">blamed foreign officials</a> [JURIST report] for the extensive irregularities that occurred during the presidential election. Though admitting that fraud was widespread, Karzai <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/04/20104114296107225.html">accused</a> [Al Jazeera report] UN and EU representatives of attempting to influence vote counts. In November, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/karzai-declared-winner-of-afghanistan.php">Karzai was declared the winner</a> [JURIST report] of the election after challenger <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1672882.stm">Abdullah Abdullah</a> [BBC profile] withdrew from the runoff election due to his belief that a free and fair vote was impossible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Oklahoma <a href="http://www.gov.ok.gov/index.php">Governor Brad Henry</a> [official website] signed three anti-abortion bills into law Monday. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/sb1890_hflr.rtf">first bill</a> [SB 1890 text, RTF] prohibits abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/sb1891_hflr.rtf">second bill</a> [SB 1891 text, RTF] creates the Freedom of Conscience Act and protects medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/sb1902_hflr.rtf">third bill</a> [SB 1902 text, RTF] regulates the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures. State Senator Todd Lamb (R), a sponsor of one of the bills, <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_2010/pr20100310d.html">explained the purpose</a> [press release] of the new measures:<br /><blockquote><br />These bills were each approved previously by the Legislature, but were prevented from taking effect due to a court ruling that they violated Oklahoma&#39;s Constitution regarding single-subjects for legislation. ... We believed then and believe now these provisions reflect the values of our state, and have successfully reaffirmed them in the Senate as individual measures.<br /></blockquote><br />The bills contain emergency clauses, causing them to <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-gov.-brad-henry-signs-3-anti-abortion-measures/article/3451543">take effect immediately</a> [NewsOK report].<br /><br />The measures signed by the governor Monday were included in previous bills that were struck down by Oklahoma courts. In March, the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a broad abortion law that included the RU-486 restrictions. In February, a state court struck down <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/oklahoma-judge-strikes-down-multi-part.php">another multi-part law</a> [JURIST report] that included the prohibition on abortion based on the gender of a fetus. The <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/index.asp?ftdb=STOKCN&level=1">Oklahoma Constitution</a> [text] requires each piece of legislation to address only one subject. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website], which initially filed lawsuits against the bills, has indicated that it will challenge the constitutionality of the separated bills.  Staff Attorney Stephanie Toti <a href="/hotline/#5939865606985017885">criticized the laws</a> [JURIST comment], arguing that &quot;they violate a myriad of constitutional principles, from freedom of speech to due process to equal protection of the law.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish police on Monday detained 19 retired military officers, including four generals, in connection with an alleged 2003 coup plot, before the chief prosecutor intervened. Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Aykut Cengiz Engin <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63537V20100406">stopped</a> [Reuters report] police from arresting up to 90 suspects, replacing two lower-level prosecutors. The alleged coup plot, known as the <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/46614.htm">Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taraf</span> report, in Turkish], or the &quot;Sledgehammer plot,&quot; was originally revealed in January by the newspaper <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/"><span style="font-style:italic;">Taraf</span></a> [media website, in Turkish]. The plot included detailed plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane as part of an effort by the military to undermine the government. The most recent arrests could increase existing tensions between military forces and the Turkish government.<br /><br />The investigation into the alleged coup plot has led to heightened political unease and conflicting judicial results. In late February, Turkish officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">brought charges</a> [JURIST report] against 11 military officials in connection with the coup just one day after three high ranking military officials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/dnp-turkey.php">released</a> [JURIST reports]. The release came after Turkey&#39;s prime minister and president met with the head of the armed forces, General Ilker Basbug, to discuss potential resolutions to the increased political strain. In response to the initial exposure of the plot in January, Turkish officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">detained</a> more than 40 people and 12 military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/twelve-turkish-military-officers.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in connection with the alleged coup plot. After the most recent round of arrests, almost 70 military officials have been detained in connection with the alleged plot.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australia confirmed Monday that it will accept three Cuban asylum seekers currently held at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] Migrations Operation Center. The center, <a href="http://americas.irc-online.org/am/6655">utilized</a> [CIP report] by the US military after the recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haiti+earthquake">Haitian earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive] to house mainly Haitian asylum seekers, is not affiliated with the US detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Upon the announcement, Australian Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/">Chris Evans</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/cuban-refugees-from-us-arriving-here-in-exchange-for-tamils/story-e6frgczf-1225850083681">denied</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Australian</font> report] any connection between Australia&#39;s acceptance of the Cuban asylum seekers and US acceptance of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Tamil">Tamil</a> [JURIST news archive] asylum seekers intercepted by the <a href="http://www.customs.gov.au/">Australian Customs Service</a> [official website] in October and <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/media-releases/2010/ce10026.htm">denied</a> [press release] entrance into Australia. All 78 asylum seekers aboard an Australian Customs Service vessel have been <a href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/connectasia/stories/200912/s2774384.htm">declared refugees</a> [Radio Australia report] by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner on Refugees</a> (UNHRC) [official website]. The Australian government has been actively <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/12/17/2775186.htm">seeking resettlement</a> [ABC report] of the refugees in countries other than Australia.<br /><br />Australia has been criticized for its <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/Human_Rights/immigration/detention_rights.html#2">Immigration Detention Policy</a> [HREOC backgrounder], which requires any non-citizen seeking entrance into Australia to be detained. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/australia-court-rules-refugees-on.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that a &quot;holder of a temporary protection visa is not entitled to further protection in Australia if they are no longer in danger in the country from which they fled&quot; and that the person may not remain a refugee. The UNHCR <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/un-criticizes-australian-illegal.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Australia for its strict policy of detaining illegal immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. A representative of the UNHCR said that detention of asylum seekers and refugees is inherently undesirable and should only be used while authorities checked identities, where travel and identification papers had been lost or destroyed, or to protect public security.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website] will <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot5910.htm">seek a record civil penalty of $16.375 million</a> [press release] against <a href="http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/index.html">Toyota Motor Corporation</a> [corporate website] for a four-month delay in notifying the agency about a problem with &quot;sticky&quot; gas pedals in various car models, US Department of Transportation <a href="http://www.dot.gov/bios/lahood.htm">Secretary Ray LaHood</a> [official profile] announced Monday. The fine, which would become the largest ever assessed against a car maker, was announced based on a preliminary review of extensive corporate documents attained through an <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot2910.htm">investigation</a> [press release] launched by the NHTSA in February. Toyota will have two weeks to appeal the fine, but, if further defect-related violations are discovered, the NHTSA may increase the fine. NHTSA <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/Cfc_title49/MVS01092008.pdf">statutes</a> [text, PDF] require that a vehicle manufacturer notify the NHTSA within five days of discovering a safety defect and launch a recall. The NHTSA has evidence that Toyota knew of the defect in late September, but notification and a recall were not launched until January.<br /><br />Toyota has been under <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_viewID=detail_view&itemID=525a58d643767210VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&viewType=standard&detailViewURL=/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX">federal scrutiny</a> [NHTSA materials] since December, and has conducted three recalls. The automaker has recalled more than eight million vehicles and is facing hundreds of private lawsuits. In March, the NHTSA enlisted the help of the <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> [official websites] to conduct a 15-month investigation into the sources of recent safety defects. The agency has faced a <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20100223/Transcript.OI.02232010.pdf">hearing</a> [transcript, PDF] before the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/">House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> [official website] and strong <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/m/29240798/nhtsa-s-failure.htm">criticism</a> [FOXNews video] regarding the effectiveness of its recent investigations into car safety defects. Previously, the largest fine assessed by the NHTSA was of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/13/pf/autos/gm_nhtsa_fine/index.htm">$1 million</a> [CNN report] against General Motors for failing to conduct a timely recall in 2004. At the time, the NHTSA was also <a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/nhtsa011405.htm">criticized</a> [CCR report] for appearing to be lenient on the American vehicle manufacturer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/home.xml">US Customs and Border Protection</a> [official website] has arrested 115 Haitians who have crossed the border illegally since the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/info/haiti-earthquake-2010/">January 12 earthquake</a> [NYT backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">news archive</a>], according to Sunday reports. Mark Henry, operations officer for the Border Patrol&#39;s <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_sectors/swanton_sector_vt/">Swanton sector</a> [official website], which covers 261 miles of the US-Canada border from New Hampshire through Vermont to New York said that <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20100404/NEWS02/100403003/Feds-Surge-in-Haitians-crossing-border-into-Vermont">114 Haitians have been arrested in Vermont</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Burlington Free Press</span> report] and one in New York. Many of the Haitians, previously deported from the US and seeking refugee status in Canada, returned to reconnect with remaining relatives in the US after losing family in the earthquake. Additionally, it is suspected that the illegal entrants are returning to the US with hopes that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">18-month Temporary Protected Status</a> (TPS) [JURIST report] will allow them to reestablish themselves and strengthen their case for citizenship. The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] granted TPS and placed a ban on deportation and removal proceedings of Haitian nationals in order to provide a temporary refuge for those already present in the US on January 12, regardless of their immigration status.<br /><br />US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] said in January that Haitians who arrived illegally after the earthquake would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-earthquake-refugees-may-not.php">sent back to Haiti</a> [JURIST report]. Napolitano told a news conference that Haitians should not view the earthquake as an open opportunity to migrate to the US, but should remain in their country to help rebuild. Additionally, the DHS announced that the US would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-grants-humanitarian-parole-to-haiti.php">allow Haitian orphans into the country</a> [JURIST report] to receive needed care in the aftermath of the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010rja6.php">7.0 magnitude earthquake</a> [USGS backgrounder] that caused massive damage to property and infrastructure in Haiti. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/index.shtml">UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti</a> [official website] has said that up to <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/documents/sg_remarks_15012010.pdf">50 percent of buildings</a> [statement, PDF] have been destroyed or damaged, including the presidential palace, the UN Mission headquarters, and the main prison, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-inmates-escape-collapsed-prison.php">allowing nearly 4,000 inmates to escape</a> [JURIST report]. Thousands of US military troops have been deployed to assist the Haitian police and international peacekeepers as they <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-confronts-rising-lawlessness.php">confront rising lawlessness</a> [JURIST report] in the country. UN officials say the death toll may <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/20/AR2010012004621.html">never be known</a> [WP report], but Haitian officials have estimated that between 100,000 to 200,000 have died as a result of the earthquake.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Thai court on Monday dismissed the government&#39;s application for an injunction against protesters gathered in Bangkok&#39;s business district. The Internal Security Operations Command, under the direction of <a href="http://media.thaigov.go.th/pageconfig/viewcontent/viewcontent1e.asp?pageid=472&directory=1944&contents=26250">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/173713/reds-break-into-ec-building">applied for an injunction</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] that would have ordered the protest organizers to lead the group out of the area after three days of protests. The court was also asked to ban rallies in 11 other areas, which, on Sunday, were declared by the government to be covered under the <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/thailandinternalsecurityactdraftof16oct2007inenglish.pdf">Internal Security Act</a> (ISA) [text, PDF], restricting protesters from entering. The court <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100405-thai-red-shirts-pledge-more-protests">denied the request</a> [AFP report], stating that it was unnecessary given that the government already had the power to evict protesters under the ISA. The protesters, known as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], are supporters of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was removed from power in 2006 following a coup. They converged on Bangkok&#39;s commercial hub on Saturday, demanding that the <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/english/">Election Commission</a> (EC) [official website] agree to expedite a corruption case against the ruling <a href="http://www.democrat.or.th/th/">Democrat Party</a> [party website, in Thai]. The party has been accused of receiving a 258 million baht (USD $8 million) donation in violation of a 10 million baht (USD $300,000) annual limit contained in the <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/english/files/2007-constitution-english%5B1%5D.pdf">Thai Constitution</a> [text, PDF].<br /><br />The Thai <a href="http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/">Cabinet</a> [official website, in Thai] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thailand-government-approves-use-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the invocation of the ISA last month to allow for increased security measures in anticipation of large anti-government protests. The Cabinet later <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/172497/thailand-extends-harsh-security-law">extended</a> [AFP report] application of the ISA after protests continued beyond the original March 23 mandate. The law was designed to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8557069.stm">provide more power to security forces</a> [BBC report] and allow for the movement of protesters to be restricted through the imposition of curfews, checkpoints, and restrictions on the size of gatherings, in the event demonstrations turn violent. In February, the Thai Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/thailand-court-seizes-assets-from.php">seized</a> [JURIST report] 46.4 billion baht (USD $1.4 billion) in assets from Thaksin for abuses of power while in office. Thaksin has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">convicted</a> of corruption in Thailand, but Cambodia has <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cambodia-refuses-to-extradite-former.php">refused</a> [JURIST reports] to extradite him. Last April, Abhisit instituted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/thailand-pm-imposes-state-of-emergency.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and several provinces following an outbreak of protests calling for his resignation. He also <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/PR-StatementRelatedSummit.pdf">canceled</a> [press release] the summit of the <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of South-East Asian Nations</a> [official website] leaders, which was being held in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on Uzbekistan Monday to deliver on promises to improve its human rights record. In a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4471">speech</a> [text] to the University of World Economy and Diplomacy in Tashkent, Ban challenged the former Soviet republic to live up to its obligations as a signatory to various international treaties banning torture and civil rights violations. The rapidly growing Central Asian nation has long faced accusations from the West of rampant political oppression and a litany of human rights abuses, including the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2007/11/05/nowhere-turn-0">use of torture on its prisoners</a> [HRW report]. Ban emphasized the importance of civil rights to the nation&#39;s growth as a democracy and as a member of the international community:<br /><blockquote><br />Central Asia is central to this world - a key player. ... You have an important place in the universal agreements that bind us as a community of nations. You have committed yourselves to many them, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture, more than 60 other international treaties on human rights. ... It is time to deliver.<br /></blockquote><br />Uzbek <a href="http://www.gov.uz/uz/president/">President Islam Karimov</a> [official profile, in Uzbek] dismissed criticism from the West, saying that his secular rule of the primarily Muslim nation is <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-47452120100405">threatened by a rising Islamist movement</a> [Reuters report]. He and Ban met privately Monday to discuss the issue further. Ban visited Uzbekistan as part of a week-long tour of Central Asia, including stops in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-turkmenistan-to-emphasize.php">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">Kyrgyzstan</a> [JURIST reports] to urge compliance with international human rights standards.<br /><br />Ban&#39;s comments come on the heels of <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-committee-urges-uzbekistan-to.php">demands</a> [JURIST report] from the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] that Uzbekistan conduct an independent investigation of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4550845.stm">May 2005 clashes</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Andijan">news archive</a>] between protesters, soldiers, and police in the city of Andijan that rights groups estimate <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/rights-group-accuses-uzbek-government.php">left as many as 500 people dead</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the committee <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/co/Uzbekistan98_AUV.doc">urged</a> [report, DOC] Uzbekistan to comply with previous recommendations and supply the UN with information on Uzbek policies regarding police use of firearms on civilians. The report was the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN26208106">first to be issued</a> [Reuters report] on Uzbekistan by the Committee since the Andijan clashes, which were sparked when <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/uzbekistan-trial-of-muslim-businessmen.php">thousands of protesters gathered</a> [JURIST report] after rebels stormed a prison and freed a group of businessmen on trial for alleged Islamic extremism. In October 2009, the European Union (EU) announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/eu-lifts-final-sanctions-against.php">lift the last of the sanctions</a> [JURIST report] it imposed on the country in November 2005 for its refusal to investigate the Andijan incident.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Paris judge has charged French oil company <a href="http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html">Total</a> [corporate website] with bribery and complicity in connection with a scandal involving the UN&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/oip/">Iraq Oil-for-Food program</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/oilforfood.php">news archive</a>], the company&#39;s lawyer confirmed Tuesday. Total announced the court&#39;s decision in its annual report last week but maintained that the company <a href="http://www.total.com/MEDIAS/MEDIAS_INFOS/3242/EN/Total-2009-document-reference-va.pdf">followed UN policy and acted lawfully</a> [text, PDF]. Total <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/d/christophe-de%20margerie/80">CEO Christophe de Margerie</a> [WSJ profile] claimed that the 2005 Volcker report, published by a UN-appointed <a href="http://iic-offp.org/index.html">Independent Inquiry Committee</a> [official website] investigating corruption in the oil-for-food scandal, had eliminated all bribery complaints related to the UN program. The investigation found that oil companies like Total allegedly paid Iraqi officials <a href="http://iic-offp.org/story27oct05.htm">over $1.5 billion in illegal kickbacks</a> [materials] in exchange for being selected as oil purchasers. The oil-for-food program allowed the Iraqi government of <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], under UN sanctions in the wake of the first Gulf War, to sell limited stocks of oil in return for foodstuffs and other humanitarian supplies.<br /><br />The charges are the latest legal problems facing Total. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca-paris.justice.fr/index.php">Paris Appellate Court</a> [official website, in French] upheld a lower court&#39;s 2008 decision finding Total and several other defendants <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-appeals-upholds-oil-company.php">criminally liable for an oil spill</a> [JURIST report] that occurred of the coast of Brittany in 1999. The court also <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/03/30/proces-de-l-erika-la-cour-d-appel-confirme-et-alourdit-les-sanctions_1326142_3224.html#ens_id=1265477">increased the fine</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">LeMonde</span> report, in French] against the defendants from 192 million euros to 200 million euros. Over <a href="http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/30/court-confirms-total-oil-spill-verdict/">20,000 tons of oil</a> [Euronews report] seeped from an oil tanker called Erika, which Total chartered from an Italian company, decimating 400 kilometers of coastline and causing harm to wildlife. Total said Tuesday that it <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6351BL20100406">plans to appeal the judgment</a> [Reuters report].

They are essential to civil harmony and growth, prosperity, opportunity. ... All of us who believe in the United Nations understand that security has many dimensions. It starts with people. Respect for the rights of all people.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Kyrgyz foreign minister <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] announced Thursday that she will lead an interim government in Kyrgyzstan after <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">violent protests</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday apparently ousted president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile] and his administration. Otunbayeva, leader of the <a href="http://sdpk.info/ru/">Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan</a> [party website, in Russian], urged Bakiyev to resign and said that her <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/08/kyrgyzstan-opposition-demands-bakiyev-resignation">temporary government will rule for six months</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] until the country holds democratic elections. Bakiyev, who fled the capital city Wednesday, said in a statement Thursday that he will <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/6949430.html">not resign</a> [AP report]. Also Thursday, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] announced that he will send an envoy to Kyrgyzstan and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34299&Cr=kyrgyzstan&Cr1=">encouraged calm</a> [UN News Centre report] in the unstable country. Ban said in a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1419">statement</a> [text] that &quot;while freedom of assembly is an essential element of any democratic society, the rule of law must be respected.&quot; Rights groups have also urged leaders to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/07/kyrgyzstan-uphold-rights-while-restoring-order">respect human rights</a> [HRW press release].<br /><br />The violent protests, which appear <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/world/europe/08bishkek.html">prompted</a> [NYT report] in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, began late Tuesday night in the city Talas then spread throughout the country Wednesday. Reports vary as to the number of citizens killed during the protests, with Kyrgyz opposition officials reporting more than 60 deaths and more than 400 injuries. Interior Minister Moldomus Kongantiyev was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100407/ts_afp/kyrgyzstanunrestpolitics_20100407123638">killed</a> [AFP report] during an attack by protesters, while former prime minister and presidential candidate Almazbek Atambayev and former parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev were among the many opposition leaders <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100407/wl_afp/kyrgyzstanoppositionunrestpolitics">arrested</a> [AFP report]. The protesters also <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2772797">took control</a> [Reuters report] of the country&#39;s television station, and approximately a thousand people surrounded the prosecutor-general&#39;s office and set it on fire. The protests came a week after Ban called on Kyrgyzstan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">protect all forms of human rights</a> [JURIST report]. The statements follow <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20100403/158422410.html">recent events</a> [RIA Novosti report] in the country that include the shutdown of an opposition newspaper, a police raid on a local television station that resulted in the station being taken off the air, and the confiscation of computers from a video web portal based on allegations of pirated software use.

According to HRW&#39;s <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/yemen0310webwcover_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], &quot;All Quiet on the Northern Front?: Uninvestigated Laws of War Violations in Yemen&#39;s War with Huthi Rebels,&quot; the February truce between the factions has not resulted in any meaningful inquiry into air strikes on populated villages, indiscriminate violence, summary executions, and child soldiers, among other alleged violations:<br /><blockquote><br />The elements of this shaky truce - the sixth in almost as many years - do not include investigations into alleged violations of the laws of war. ... The continuing failure of both the Yemeni government and the Huthi rebels to investigate alleged violations by their forces prevents perpetrators from being held to account, denies compensation to victims of abuses, and complicates efforts to reach a long-term political settlement.<br /></blockquote><br />HRW also accused the UN of failing to provide an organization tasked with monitoring the crisis and the possible human rights abuses. HRW is petitioning concerned governments to encourage Yemen to increase access and transparency in order to hold perpetrators liable for crimes.<br /><br />The Yemeni war against them Shiite Huthi Rebels, termed the Sa&#39;dah insurgency, began in June 2004 with the uprising lead by Zaidi religious leader Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi against the Yemeni government. That time period was marked with five distinct phases or cycles of violence. Yemen has alleged that the Huthi Rebels have continuously received support from Iran and other sympathetic governments. The lack of transparency and the remoteness of fighting make it difficult to ascertain causalities in which estimates range from the hundreds to the thousands.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thai <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website, in Thai; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">BBC profile</a>] on Wednesday declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and several nearby provinces in response to escalating political protests. The state of emergency was declared after protesters, known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g3j-vAVG1fg3kEfnogTiH8_4EXvwD9EU6TVG0">broke into Parliament</a> [AP report] earlier Wednesday, causing government officials to evacuate. Under the <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/politics/173946/state-of-emergency-declared">state of emergency</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report], which took effect immediately, public gatherings are banned, police are given broader powers to arrest and detain, curfews can be instituted, the government may censor media reports, and detainees can be held for 30 days without access to legal counsel. Abhisit stated his goals during the institution of the state of emergency include putting an end to escalating violence and restoring normalcy. <br /><br />The declaration comes just days after a Thai <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-denies-injunction.php">court dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the government&#39;s application for an injunction against protesters gathered in Bangkok&#39;s business district. The injunction would have ordered protest organizers to lead the group out of the area and would have banned rallies in 11 other areas. The court denied the request stating that the <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/thailandinternalsecurityactdraftof16oct2007inenglish.pdf">Internal Security Act</a> [text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thailand-government-approves-use-of.php">approved by the Thai Cabinet</a> [JURIST report] in March, already gave the government eviction powers. The red shirts are supporters of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from  power</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 following a coup.  The group is demanding that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call new elections. Last April, Abhisit <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/thailand-pm-imposes-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and several provinces following a similar outbreak of protests calling for his resignation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201004/08-1291-1238302.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] lacks authority to require broadband providers to treat all Internet traffic equally. The appeal was brought by cable giant <a href="http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/About/Corporateinfo/Corporateinfo.html">Comcast</a> [official website] to review whether the FCC has the authority to enforce its newly-developed <a href="http://www.timwu.org/network_neutrality.html">&quot;net neutrality&quot;</a> [backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">news archive</a>] regulations. The concept of net neutrality, supported unanimously by the FCC commissioners, is to allow for the open flow of information over the Internet, regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. The present case stems from an FCC sanction on Comcast for blocking customers&#39; access to peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, which allows Internet users to share large files directly, potentially using a lot of bandwidth. The commission ruled that Comcast had &quot;significantly impeded consumers&#39; ability to access the content and use the applications of their choice.&quot; Comcast argued that its method of traffic flow management was used to prevent the degradation of Internet quality for its customers as a whole. The appeals agreed with Comcast, holding that the FCC failed to show that it had the authority to impose &quot;net neutrality&quot; restrictions on broadband providers:<br /><blockquote><br />[The FCC] relies principally on several congressional statements of policy, but under Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit case law statements of policy, by themselves, do not create &#39;statutorily mandated responsibilities. ... The commission also relies on various provisions of the Communications Act that do create such responsibilities, but for a variety of substantive and procedural reasons those provisions cannot support its exercise of ancillary authority over Comcast&#39;s network management practices.<br /></blockquote><br />The FCC <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297355A1.pdf">responded</a> [press release, PDF] that it &quot;is firmly committed to promoting an open Internet and to policies that will bring the enormous benefits of broadband to all Americans.&quot;<br /><br />The ruling could be a major setback for the FCC, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fcc-presents-broadband-regulation-plan.php">released a major broadband expansion plan</a> [JURIST report] last month. The FCC&#39;s <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">National Broadband Plan</a> [materials] was sent to Congress for approval and seeks to enact regulations to update the communications infrastructure in the US and to make broadband service available to millions of Americans. The plan is mandated by provisions of the <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/About/Pages/The_Act.aspx">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a> (ARRA) [materials]. Notable goals of the plan include providing 100 million households with affordable 100-megabits-per-second Internet service, making 500 megahertz of wireless spectrum available for licensed and unlicensed use by mobile applications, and ensuring that all children are literate in digital technology by the time they leave high school.

Under the terms of the treaty and its <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140047.pdf">protocol</a> [text, PDF], both countries would only be allowed to deploy 1,550 strategic warheads, a decrease from the 2,200 currently permitted. The treaty would also re-establish mechanisms to allow each party to inspect the other&#39;s nuclear arsenal. Speaking at a joint press conference after signing the treaty, Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-obama-and-president-medvedev-russia-new-start-treaty-signing-cere">said</a> [transcript] that &quot;[w]hile the New START treaty is an important first step forward, it is just one step on a longer journey,&quot; reiterating his vision of a world without nuclear arms. Medvedev <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/transcripts/7399">praised the treaty</a> [transcript, in Russian; <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/video/368">video</a>, in Russian] as &quot;a very important step to build trust and understanding between our two countries.&quot; The treaty must be ratified by both countries before entering into force.  <br /><br />The treaty agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Several visual artist organizations filed a <a href="/pdf/asmpgooglecomplaint.pdf">class action suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.mishcon.com/newyork/press_releases/google_class_action_suit">press release</a>] Wednesday against <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website] alleging copyright infringement resulting from the company&#39;s <a href="http://books.google.com/bkshp?hl=en&tab=wp">book scanning project</a> [Google Books website]. The plaintiffs include the <a href="http://asmp.org/">American Society of Media Photographers</a> (ASMP), the <a href="http://www.graphicartistsguild.org/">Graphic Artists Guild</a>, the <a href="http://www.pacaoffice.org/">Picture Archive Council of America</a>, the <a href="http://www.nanpa.org/">North American Nature Photography Association</a>, <a href="http://www.ppa.com/">Professional Photographers of America</a> [websites], as well as individual photographers and illustrators. The visual artists&#39; class action is being brought in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], the same court where an earlier class action was brought against Google by text authors. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, ASMP and the other visual artists decided to bring a separate suit when they were prevented from joining the earlier action.    <br /><br />Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-urges-additional-revisions-to.php">urged a federal court to reject</a> [JURIST report] the proposed <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/settlement-resources.html">class action settlement</a> [Authors Guild backgrounder] in the <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/">copyright suit</a> [case materials] between text authors and Google due to copyright and antitrust concerns. In February, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the proposed settlement but did not indicate when a ruling can be expected. The case originated when two lawsuits were brought against Google by the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/">Authors Guild</a> [advocacy website], a group seeking to preserve copyright protection for authors, and by other plaintiffs including the <a href="http://www.publishers.org/">Association of American Publishers</a> (AAP) [organization website], <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/">McGraw-Hill</a>, <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/aboutus/index.html">Penguin Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?feature_id=1625&tab=1">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> [corporate websites]. Under the terms of the original settlement agreement, which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, Google would pay $125 million to authors and publishers of copyrighted works. In return, Google would be allowed to display online up to 20 percent of the total pages of a copyrighted book, and would offer users an opportunity to purchase the remainder of any viewed book.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website] <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2010/april2010/190582.htm">ruled</a> [judgment text] Thursday that a prominent gay rights organization may field candidates in the upcoming national elections as an accredited political party.  The decision invalidates an <a href="http://www.comelec.gov.ph/2010%20National_Local/resolutions/spp_09_228.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] issued by the <a href="http://www.comelec.gov.ph/">Commission on Elections</a> (Comelec) [official website] in November that rejected a bid for party recognition by <a href="http://www.angladlad.com/">Ang Ladlad</a> [party website]. In denying Ang Ladlad&#39;s original petition, Comelec cited the group&#39;s &quot;[tolerance of] immorality which offends religious beliefs.&quot; The court, however, determined that the policy violated Article III, Section 5 of the Philippines <a href="http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200034&Itemid=26">Constitution</a> [text], which has previously been interpreted to mandate &quot;government neutrality in religious matters.&quot; The decision stated:<br /><blockquote><br />[W]e hold that moral disapproval, without more, is not a sufficient governmental interest to justify exclusion of homosexuals from participation in the party-list system. The denial of Ang Ladlad&#39;s registration on purely moral grounds amounts more to a statement of dislike and disapproval of homosexuals, rather than a tool to further any substantial public interest. Respondent&#39;s blanket justifications give rise to the inevitable conclusion that the Comelec targets homosexuals themselves as a class, not because of any particular morally reprehensible act.<br /></blockquote><br />Having met all legal requirements for certification as a party, the court ordered that Ang Ladlad be permitted to fully participate in the May elections.<br /><br />The court <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/node/238275/">issued a temporary restraining order</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Manila Bulletin</font> report] against Comelec in January, requiring the body to include Ang Ladlad on the list of official parties until a decision on the case&#39;s merits could be reached. In December, Comelec again <a href="http://www.gmanews.tv/story/179605/ang-ladlads-petition-to-join-2010-polls-junked-with-finality">rejected</a> [GMA report] Ang Ladlad&#39;s request for accreditation. Officials voting against the group reiterated their moral concerns, and stated that their interests are sufficiently represented legislatively.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://projecthamad.org/">Adel Hassan Hamad</a> [advocacy website] filed <a href="/pdf/HamadComplaintApr82010.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] Wednesday against the US government and more than a dozen government officials. Hamad, a Sudanese aid worker captured in Pakistan in 2002, claims he was tortured during his time at Guantanamo Bay. A lawyer for Hamad claimed in 2007 that he was <a href="/forumy/2007/01/representing-adel-case-of-guantanamo.php">not guilty of any crimes</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the government had obstructed lawyers&#39; attempts to clear his name. It is unclear how much compensation Hamad is seeking.<br /><br />Hamad was among a group of former detainees who <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/ex-guantanamo-prisoners-in-sudan-demand.php">announced in Sudan</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 that they planned to sue the US government in US courts. The US government <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/dod-transfers-15-detainees-from.php">released Hamad</a> [JURIST report] in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kenyan <a href="http://www.mfa.go.ke/mfacms/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=0&Itemid=62">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] declared Wednesday that Kenya&#39;s government is attempting to secure the release of Kenyan native Mohammed Abdumalik, who is currently detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. The news was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jBGAMgiFoza7nUDgPQ3-_OevHXXAD9EUAJ200">revealed in a letter</a> [AP report] to Abdulmalik&#39;s family, informing them that the government will ask the United States to release the detainee. Abdulmalik&#39;s family <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/family-of-guantanamo-detainee-files.php">filed a $30 million lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Kenyan government last year, claiming that Abdulmalik was illegally detained, tortured, and rendered to US authorities.<br /><br />Abdulmalik was originally arrested by the Kenyan Anti-terrorism Police Unit in Mombasa in 2007 in connection with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/30/international/africa/30MOMB.html">2002 bombing of a resort hotel</a> [NYT report] and a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2525931.stm">failed attempt</a> [BBC report] to shoot down an Israeli charter plane. He was then taken into US custody and eventually <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=10662">transferred to Guantanamo</a> [DOD press release] where he allegedly <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/03/26/us-stop-guantanamo-circus">confessed</a> [HRW report] to the crimes, although his <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/Combatant_Tribunals.html">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> [official website] report is still classified. British human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], which has helped Abdulmalik&#39;s family, <a href="http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143998109&cid=4">stated</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Standard</font> report] that the case points out the illegal means by which detainees have ended up in Guantanamo. Kenyan authorities <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2007/03/sec-070314-voa01.htm">deny</a> [GlobalSecurity report] arresting Abdulmalik, whom they claim is not a Kenyan citizen, and handing him over to the US military.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of citizens from Kinston, North Carolina, on Wednesday filed <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Sec.-5-complaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] claiming that <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> [DOJ backgrounder] of the federal <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text] unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of race. Section 5 requires certain voting districts to seek federal approval before making any changes to voting procedure, in order for the government to ensure that the changes do not adversely affect minority voting rights. Kinston had sought to institute a non-partisan voting system, but was <a href="http://www.cir-usa.org/legal_docs/kinston_v_holder_dojletter.pdf">denied approval</a> [DOJ letter, PDF] to do so by the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The DOJ found that even though the system was not intended to harm minority interests, it would have the effect of reducing minority political representation. The <a href="http://www.cir-usa.org/cases/laroque_v_holder.html">group filing the complaint</a> [advocacy backgrounder] argues that Section 5 is unconstitutional because it does not provide the same protection for non-minority groups and because its original rationale has now expired.<br /><br />In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>] Section 5 without reaching its constitutional validity. The court ruled 8-1 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-322">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the VRA permits covered municipalities to &quot;bail out&quot; from the preclearance requirement of Section 5 if they can establish a history of compliance with the VRA, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of Congress&#39;s 25-year extension of the section in 2006. The city of Kinston did not seek the bail out option.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201004/07/espana/20100407elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">charged</a> [order, PDF; in Spanish] National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] with abuse of power for the investigation of war crimes allegedly committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] during the <a href="http://unx1.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/SpanCW.html">Spanish Civil War</a> [LOC backgrounder]. In 2008, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordered the exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain in order to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite a 1977 amnesty law. Investigating magistrate Luciano Varela ruled that it is likely Garzon committed abuse of power by conducting the investigation. Garzon&#39;s lawyer <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/juez/Varela/sentara/Garzon/banquillo/causa/franquismo/elpepuesp/20100407elpepunac_2/Tes">plans to challenge</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] the charges on appeal and has described the proceedings as &quot;contaminated.&quot; No trial date has been set. If convicted, Garzon could be removed from the bench.<br /><br />After a February ruling that Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-court-rules-judge-garzon-may-have.php">may have exceeded his jurisdictional authority</a> by launching the investigation, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled last month that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-high-court-rules-garzon-can-face.php">could be formally charged</a> [JURIST reports]. Garzon has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-high-court-to-hear-challenge.php">agreed to review</a> [JURIST report] Garzon&#39;s actions last May in response to a complaint filed by <a href="http://www.manoslimpias.es/">Manos Limpias</a> [group website, in Spanish], a union of public servants in Spain, which alleged that Garzon did not have the requisite jurisdictional authority to launch the investigation. Just one month after Garzon launched the investigation in 2008, Spanish prosecutors and other political figures voiced their concern by <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spanish-prosecutors-challenge-garzon.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile cases, including those against <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Texas <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/">Attorney General Greg Abbott</a> [official website] announced Wednesday that <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagNews/release.php?id=3283">five additional states will join</a> [press release] in a <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the constitutionality of the recently enacted <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [HR 3590 materials]. The five states - Indiana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada, and Arizona - will join <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">13 other states</a> [JURIST report] in a legal battle that began last month 23 when the complaint seeking an injunction and declaratory relief was filed in a Florida federal court. Abbott commented on the impact of the inclusion of additional states and voiced his concern over the potential effects the health care legislation will have on Texas and the US:<br /><blockquote><br />No public policy goal - no matter how important or well-intended - can be allowed to trample the protections and rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The federal health care legislation violates our Constitution, imposes an unprecedented mandate on individual Texans, and will require the Texas taxpayers to spend billions of additional  dollars on health care programs. The addition of five new states to our bipartisan legal challenge reflects broad, nationwide concern about the constitutionality of this sweeping and unprecedented federal legislation.<br /></blockquote><br />The other states involved in the suit are Florida, South Carolina, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, Utah, Alabama, South Dakota, and Idaho.  <br /><br />Among the allegations in the suit are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property, or profession, and for invading the the sovereignty of the states. The plaintiffs also assert that the law should not be upheld under the commerce clause. Last month, Idaho Governor CL Otter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] barring the federal mandate to purchase health insurance. Virginia Governor Bob McDonald has indicated that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">sign a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] recently passed by the Virginia legislature. President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-amendments.php">signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act</a> [JURIST report] into law last week, which addressed concerns raised by the original bill, including provisions to help uninsured Americans pay for coverage, concerns over the effects to Medicare, and lowering the penalty for not buying insurance.

		<title>Turkish ruling party submits new version of proposed constitutional amendments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkey&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]  on Monday submitted a <a href="http://www2.tbmm.gov.tr/d23/2/2-0656.pdf">new version of their proposed Constitutional amendments</a> [text, PDF; in Turkish] to the <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/index.htm">Grand National Assembly</a> [official website, in Turkish]. The draft differs only slightly in substance from the previous version that the party submitted. One of the new additions is a proposal to alter Article 157 of the <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/anayasa.htm">Constitution</a> [text, in Turkish] so that judges of the Military Supreme Administrative Court would have judicial immunity and be shielded from spurious claims. Perhaps the most significant difference between the old and new versions is the signatures. The new version has signatures from 265 AKP representatives excluding Parliament Speaker <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/milletvekillerimiz_sd.bilgi?p_donem=23&p_sicil=5482">Mehmet Ali Shahin</a> [official profile, in Turkish]. Some <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/100829/new-turkish-amendment-text-submitted-following-signature-crisis.html">controversy arose</a> [Turkish Weekly report] after Shahin signed the first version because of his obligation to remain impartial as speaker. As a result, there was a strong likelihood that the proposed changes would have been dismissed for technical reasons. In light of the new proposal packet from AKP, a parliamentary committee meeting scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the previous version of the amendments was postponed. <br /><br />The first version of AKP&#39;s proposed amendments was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-submits.php">submitted to parliament</a> [JURIST report] last Tuesday, despite warnings from Turkish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6595511.stm">President Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC profile] that the party should take more precautions before amending the constitution. The reform package contains <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=box-box-box---for-revised-reform-package-story-2010-03-30">seven revisions</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report] from the original amendments <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-unveils-proposed.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] at the end of March, including a highly-disputed reform to the judiciary system that would allow military and government officials to be tried in civilian court. The reform would also make it harder for the government to disband political parties that challenge the country&#39;s nationalist establishment and would ban the prosecution of the 1980 coup leaders. AKP says it created the amendments to promote democracy in Turkey and support its bid into the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. The proposed amendments have been met with opposition by Turkey&#39;s <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Turkish]. In an interview in late March, the president of the court <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/content/view/44/36/">Hasan Gerceker</a> [official profile, in Turkish] declared that the proposed amendments <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/top-turkish-judge-proposed.php">threaten separation of power and judicial independence</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Anti-government protesters in Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday set fire to the prosecutor-general&#39;s office amid violent demonstrations that have led to the death of the interior minister, the arrest of several opposition leaders, and the deaths of dozens of protesters. The protests against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">President Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile], which appear <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/world/europe/08bishkek.html">prompted</a> [NYT report] in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, began late Tuesday night in the city Talas then spread throughout the country Wednesday. Interior Minister Moldomus Kongantiyev was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100407/ts_afp/kyrgyzstanunrestpolitics_20100407123638">killed</a> [AFP report] during an attack by protesters in Talas. Former prime minister and presidential candidate Almazbek Atambayev and former parliament speaker Omurbek Tekebayev were among the many opposition leaders <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100407/wl_afp/kyrgyzstanoppositionunrestpolitics">arrested</a> [AFP report] as a result of the protests. Bakiyev has declared a state of emergency throughout the country, urging citizens to remain indoors. The protesters have also <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2772797">taken control</a> [Reuters report] of the country&#39;s television station, and approximately a thousand people surrounded the prosecutor-general&#39;s office, reportedly setting it on fire. Reports vary as to the number of citizens that have been killed during the protests, with news organizations reporting as many as 50. Kyrgyz police used bullets and tear gas to protect the presidential office in Bishkek. <br /><br />The protests come a week after UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called on Kyrgyzstan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">protect all forms of human rights</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;free speech and freedom of the media.&quot; The statements <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20100403/158422410.html">follow recent events</a> [RIA Novosti report] in the country that include the shutdown of an opposition newspaper, a police raid on a local television station that resulted in the station being taken off the air, and the confiscation of computers from a video web portal based on allegations of pirated software use. Opposition members <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Opposition_Rallies_As_UN_Chief_Visits_In_Kyrgyzstan/2001706.html">gathered in support</a> [RFE/RL report] of Ban&#39;s comments. Kyrgyzstan was once hailed as a model for democracy in the Central Asian countries that made up the former Soviet Union. It is believed that much of the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gZVgmZoHTPkuY_xr34mzCluVcEVQD9ERKKHO0">media pressure</a> [AP report] is the result of the election of Bakiyev following the Tulip revolution that removed Askar Akayev from power in 2005. Last year, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] criticized Kyrgyzstan over its treatment of journalists in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">report</a>].<br /><br />3:00 PM ET - Kyrgyz opposition leaders <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6363CR20100407">claim to have taken power</a> [Reuters report], having forced the government to resign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Wednesday convicted 29 members of the paramilitary group <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] on charges relating to their involvement in last year&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7912112.stm">border guard mutiny</a> [BBC Backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bangladesh+mutiny">news archive</a>]. The military-run court in Panchagarh district sentenced those convicted to jail terms ranging from four months to seven years. The sentences are the first of dozens of cases against approximately <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/07/AR2010040701513.html">3,500 alleged mutiny participants</a> [WP report] who are being tried throughout Bangladesh. Civilian courts are <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/bangladesh-jails-29-soldiers-over-mutiny-20100407-rsdp.html">hearing more serious charges</a> [AFP report] related to the mutiny, such as murder, arson, and rape, and may impose the death penalty on those found guilty.<br /><br />In September, Bangladesh&#39;s <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/bangladesh-high-court-recommends.php">recommended against</a> [JURIST report] military court-martial trials for BDR members who took part in the mutiny, which killed dozens of BDR officers, including the force&#8217;s commander. <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=135&Itemid=208">President Zillur Rahman</a> [official profile] asked for the court&#39;s opinion to determine whether the accused should be tried under the <a href="http://www.bdlaws.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?act_name=&vol=&id=248">Army Act of 1952</a> [text] or whether they should face civilian trials. The court took into account the advice of 10 top lawyers and legal experts, seven of whom <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6756177.html">opposed</a> [People&#39;s Daily report] the use of military trials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.polisen.se">Swedish Police</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.aklagare.se/Media/Nyheter/Pressmeddelande-Misstankt-krigsforbrytare-gripen1/">arrested</a> [press release, in Swedish] a Kosovo war crimes suspect. The suspect is accused of committing war crimes during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo+war">news archive</a>] in the small village of Cuska in May 1999. A Swedish police spokesperson did not release the man&#39;s full name because of Swedish privacy laws but did state that the suspect is a <a href="http://www.swedishwire.com/politics/3693-kosovo-war-crimes-suspect-arrested-in-sweden">Serbian man in his 30s</a> [AFP/SW report]. The <a href="http://www.aklagare.se/">Swedish Prosecution Authority</a> [official website, in Swedish] will request on Friday that the suspect remain in custody until trial. It is not clear where the suspect will <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/international/europe/view/20100407kosovo_war_crimes_suspect_arrested_in_sweden/srvc=home&position=recent">face charges</a> [AP report].  <br /><br />In March, a spokesperson for Serbia&#39;s <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor</a> [official website] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/serbia-police-arrest-9-suspected-of.php">arrest of nine individuals</a> [JURIST report] suspected of committing war crimes during the Kosovo war. In June, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] marked the 10-year anniversary of the conflict&#39;s end by reporting that many human rights abuses that occurred during the war in Kosovo have gone <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-claims-kosovo-war-crimes.php">uninvestigated and unpunished</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors have nonetheless secured several convictions. A week after AI&#39;s report, a Serbian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/serbia-court-sentences-ex-paramilitary.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] four former paramilitary officers of killing 14 Albanians in northern Kosovo. In April 2009, four Serbian ex-policemen were <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/serbia-war-crimes-court-convicts-ex.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of killing of 48 Albanian civilians in Suva Reka.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk">National Assembly</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously passed a <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/govt_bills/govt_bill2010/constitution_eighteenth_amendment_act2010_060410.pdf">constitutional amendment</a> [text, PDF] that would curtail the powers of the president. The 18th Amendment Bill would reverse the expansion of presidential powers under former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>] by transferring presidential powers to the <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Cabinet/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNDE_1wkA6zeAMcwNFA388jPzdVvyA7rxwAicV1Mg%21%21/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwODdTNTAyRUlOMzQxTTEwOTQ%21/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/CabDivCL/division/secretary/prime+minister">office of the prime minister</a> [official website], effectively reserving the presidency as a figurehead. Among other changes, the president would no longer have the power to dissolve parliament, dismiss the prime minister, or appoint the chief of the armed forces. The bill must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate and be signed by <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] before becoming law.<br /><br />The introduction of the bill comes amid controversy over reopening corruption investigations against Zardari. Last week, Pakistan&#39;s Attorney General Anwar Mansoor <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-ag-resigns-amid-corruption.php">announced his resignation</a> over controversy surrounding a Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">order to investigate corruption allegations</a> [JURIST reports] against Zardari. Earlier that week, Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zardari. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf. The amnesty was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by Musharraf as part of a power-sharing accord allowing former Pakistani prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC profile] to return to the country despite <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/former-pakistan-pm-bhutto-facing.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] she had faced.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A North Korean court sentenced a US citizen to eight years in prison on Wednesday for illegally entering the country. Aijalon Mahli Gomes was arrested in January for illegally crossing the border and was charged with <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/04/113_63792.html">illegal entry and unspecified hostile acts</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Korea Times</span> report]. Gomes&#39;s sentence includes eight years of hard labor and a fine equivalent to USD $700,000. The imprisonment of an American citizen is seen as a significant bargaining chip for North Korea, as the resumption of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/01/2861974.htm">multilateral negotiations</a> [ABC News report] involving the US over the status of North Korea&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/nuke.htm">nuclear program</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] increases in likelihood. Gomes is the fourth American to be detained for illegal entry into North Korea in the past 13 months, but none of those past detentions continued for longer than five months. <br /><br />North Korea&#39;s detention and treatment of prisoners has been the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=North+Korea+human+rights">subject of criticism</a> [JURIST news archive] from numerous world governments and activist groups. In February, US rights activist Robert Park was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/07/robert-park-north-korea-home">released</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] after a two-month detention for <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/north-korea-detains-us-citizen-for.php">illegally entering North Korea</a> [JURIST report] in December. In August, North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/north-korea-pardons-detained-us.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] two American journalists for their illegal entry, after negotiations with former US president Bill Clinton. The journalists had been <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/north-korea-detains-two-us-journalists.php">detained in March</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly crossing the North Korean border with China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International USA</a> (AIUSA) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/dignity/pdf/Un-Natural_Disaster_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20100409001">press release</a> ] Friday accusing the government of committing human rights violations against the victims of <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive].  The group criticized the response of officials at the local, state, and federal levels for being overly bureaucratic and lacking both accountability and leadership.  As a result, according to AIUSA, low-income and minority communities were subjected to police misconduct and denied access to affordable housing and healthcare.  The group also faulted the federal <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/stafford_act.pdf">Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act</a> [text, PDF] for noncompliance with the UN <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/43ce1cff2.pdf">Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</a> [text, PDF] by failing to include provisions to ensure that the effects of disaster relief efforts do not bear socioeconomically or racially discriminatory impacts.  The group called on the government to return victims to their their original homes and to improve their access to government services.<br /><br />In November 2008, US housing advocates <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/fair-housing-groups-file-lawsuit-over.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a class action <a href="http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=9nkhWbMKfCA%3d&tabid=3313&mid=6914&forcedownload=true">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the government arguing that Louisiana&#39;s Hurricane Katrina recovery program, <a href="http://www.road2la.org/">Road Home Louisiana</a> [program website], discriminates against African-American homeowners.  The US federal government has been repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-engages-in-persistent-racial.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] for its alleged discriminatory treatment of African-Americans in response to Hurricane Katrina.  In February 2008, the UN <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/907604B6DAF5E2F1C12573FD007AD7DC?opendocument">called on</a> [press release] the US to put a stop to discrimination against African-Americans who were being evicted from their homes or denied access to other available housing in the wake of the hurricane.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Thursday <a href="/pdf/KaradzicDecisionOnMotionToStay.pdf">denied</a> [judgment, PDF] the latest <a href="/pdf/KaradzicMotionToStay.pdf">attempt</a> [motion, PDF] by former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>] to delay his war crimes trial. Karadzic argued that there had been a violation of his right to a fair hearing because the court had rejected previous evidentiary challenges. The ICTY dismissed Kardzic&#39;s motion, reasoning that:<blockquote>Until the final Judgement is issued in this case, the parties can only speculate as to what evidence the Chamber will admit, how that evidence will be evaluated, and what conclusions will be drawn from it. Should the Chamber base any conviction of the Accused solely on witness evidence that has not been subject to cross-examination, it will be for the Accused to raise that issue on appeal at the appropriate time.<br /><br />For these reasons, the Chamber is not satisfied that there has been any violation of the Accused&#39;s right to a fair trial which would justify a stay of the proceedings. </blockquote>Karadzic&#39;s trial is set to resume on Tuesday.<br /><br />Last month, Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/icty-denies-karadzic-appeal-to-delay.php">lost another motion</a> [JURIST report] to postpone his war crimes trial on charges related to crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Karadzic claimed that a February ruling increasing the remuneration for his defense lawyers should also give him extra time to prepare for his case. Earlier in March, the ICTY heard <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">opening statements</a> [JURIST report] in Karadzic&#39;s war crimes trial. Karadzic claimed that attacks against Bosnian Muslims were &quot;staged,&quot; <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-hears-opening-statements-in.php">denying</a> [JURIST report] any involvement in war crimes.. In February, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icty-dismisses-karadzic-appeal-of-court.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Karadzic&#39;s imposition of a court-appointed defense lawyer, claiming the right to legal assistance of his own choosing. Karadzic is defending himself against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 counts</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide and murder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Sunday accused both <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=israel">Israel</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archives] of failing to conduct meaningful, credible investigations into accusations of war crimes during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm"> January 2009 Gaza conflict</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">news archive</a>]. In a 62-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iopt0410webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/04/11/turning-blind-eye-0">materials</a>] HRW described the alleged law of war violations committed during the combat, along with the deficient responses from both sides:<blockquote>More than one year after the conflict, neither side has taken adequate measures to investigate serious violations or to punish the perpetrators of war crimes, leaving civilian victims without redress. Israel&#8217;s investigations have fallen far short of international standards for investigations, while Hamas has conducted no credible investigations at all.<br /><br />States responsible for violations of the laws of war are required to make reparations, which includes providing fair and adequate compensation to victims and their relatives, and establishing the truth about what happened. ... States also have an obligation to investigate war crimes allegedly committed by their armed forces, and if appropriate, to prosecute those responsible.</blockquote> The report also called on the UN and members of the international community to pressure both Israel and Hamas to conduct &quot;thorough and impartial investigations&quot; into the war crimes allegations.<br /><br />In February, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-probe-of-gaza-fighting-not.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Israel for failing to demonstrate that it would conduct a thorough and impartial investigation of the alleged war crimes. Just prior to that, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/un-chief-unsure-whether-israel.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8499655.stm">unclear</a> [BBC report] whether Israel and Palestine have fully met <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">UN demands</a> [JURIST report] to set up a commission to investigate war crimes that may occurred during the conflict. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] last November giving Israel and Palestine three months to complete an investigation into war crimes allegations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a>  [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] on Saturday <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201004/10/espana/20100410elpepunac_2_Pes_PDF.pdf">appealed</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] an indictment that <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201004/07/espana/20100407elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">charges</a>  [order, PDF, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">report</a>] him with abuse of power for launching an investigation of alleged war crimes committed during the <a href="http://unx1.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/SpanCW.html">Spanish Civil War</a> [LOC backgrounder]. Garzon alleges that the indictment issued by Spanish Supreme Court judge Luciano Varela is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iIycMSqjnEYpc9xkwbBxs1kOsKhw">politically motivated</a> [AFP report], compromises judicial independence and seeks to impose a specific interpretation of a 1977 law granting amnesty for political crimes committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Garzon also complains of the short time he was given to appeal the indictment order, which resulted from Varela&#39;s summary motion to shorten the length of the trial. Garzon&#39;s indictment has sparked international <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/opinion/09fri2.html">outrage</a> [NYT op-ed] and massive <a href="http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2010/04/09/index.php?section=mundo&article=021n1mun">protests</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Jornada</span> report, in Spanish] in Spain. Also on Saturday, the <a href="http://www.memoriahistorica.org/">Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory</a> [advocacy website, in Spanish], an organization for relatives of Franco Regime victims, <a href="http://elcomercio.pe/noticia/459178/denunciaran-juez-que-abrio-proceso-contra-baltasar-garzon">announced</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Comercio</span> report, in Spanish] that it intends to file a criminal complaint against Varela for violating international law in the application of the amnesty law. Members of the organization have said that, if necessary, they would pursue a suit against Varela in courts in Chile or Argentina through <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news  archive</a>]. <br /><br />In 2008, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordered  the exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain in order  to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite the amnesty law. After ruling in February that Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-court-rules-judge-garzon-may-have.php">may  have exceeded his jurisdictional authority</a> by launching the  investigation, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled last month that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-high-court-rules-garzon-can-face.php">could  be formally charged</a> [JURIST reports]. Garzon has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">defended</a>  [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he  acted within the bounds of the law. Garzon is widely known for using universal jurisdiction extensively in the past to bring several high-profile  cases, including those against <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama  bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto  Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish politician and Kurdish rights activist <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/691/000134289/">Leyla Zana</a> [NNDB profile] was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison for spreading terrorist propaganda. Zana was <a href="http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=970816&title=leyla-zanaya-hapis-cezasi">convicted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Zaman</span> report, in Turkish] by a court in the city of Diyarbakir for two speeches delivered at the Kurdish political congress and protest in 2008. Zana has previously been convicted for spreading propaganda under Turkey&#39;s anti-terrorism laws, most recently facing a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/turkish-court-sentences-kurdish.php">10-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 for supporting the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7044760.stm">Kurdistan Worker&#39;s Party</a> (PKK) [BBC profile; FAS <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/pkk.htm">backgrounder</a>], a militant Kurdish nationalist group. She <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/08/AR2010040803189.html">remains free</a> [Reuters report] pending appeal. Turkey has been accused of using its anti-terrorism laws to suppress Kurdish nationalists. The <a href="http://www.khrp.org/component/option,com_frontpage/Itemid,1/">Kurdish Human Rights Project</a> (KHRP) [advocacy website] criticized Turkey&#39;s <a href="http://www.khrp.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,166/Itemid,47/">anti-terrorism laws</a> [KHRP briefing paper] saying that though they were passed due to heightened security concerns, they have hindered freedom of expression, association, and have been used to suppress certain groups like the Kurds. <br /><br />Zana was the first women elected to Turkey&#39;s parliament in 1991, and shortly thereafter there were calls for her arrest when she read the Parliamentary Oath in Kurdish. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison, along with other members of her Democracy Party, when the party was banned in 1994. She served 10 years in prison until her conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/turkish-appeals-court-overturns.htm">overturned</a> and she was <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/kurdish-lawmakers-freed-by-turkish.htm">freed from prison</a> [JURIST reports] in 2004. In calling for a peaceful settlement to issues of Kurdish rights, she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 and 1998, and was awarded the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sakharov/default_en.htm">Sakharov Prize</a> [official website] in 1995.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian prosecutors on Friday sought to indict Italy <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] on <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-pm-berlusconi-may-face-third.php">fraud and embezzlement charges</a> [JURIST report] involving his media company, Mediatrade, despite a new law granting the executive temporary immunity. The law <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March and allows cabinet officials to postpone criminal proceedings against them for up to 18 months if the charges constitute a &quot;legitimate impediment&quot; to performing public duties. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6380BQ20100409">claim</a> [Reuters report] that while Berlusconi was head of Mediatrade, it sold television rights at inflated prices to a US producer, resulting in illegitimate gains of approximately $47 million. Prosecutors also <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/10_aprile_09/frode_diritti_tv_550d8b3c-4398-11df-9c20-00144f02aabe.shtml">sought to charge</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</span> report, in Italian] Berlusconi&#39;s son, Pier Silvio Berlusconi, and nine others in connection to the case. Berlusconi&#39;s lawyers deny that he was in control of Mediatrade during the deals, and have not indicated whether they will invoke the immunity law.<br /><br />The law granting Berlusconi immunity was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-lower-house-approves-bill-that.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] in February. In January, hundreds of Italy&#39;s judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of legislation that placed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. Both laws have been criticized as being tailored for Berlusconi&#39;s benefit. He currently faces corruption and tax fraud trials, both of which have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-corruption-trial-of-pm-berlusconi.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report]. The leader has been previously acquitted of <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/italian-court-clears-berlusconi-of.php">false accounting</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/italian-prosecutors-appeal-bribery.php">bribery</a>, and has had other charges against him <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italian-judge-drops-some-tax-fraud.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US district court judge James Robertson <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/docs/Settlement_status_hearing.pdf">granted Congress additional time</a> [transcript, PDF] Thursday to approve a <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/docs/2009.12.07_Settlement_Agreement.pdf">$3.4 billion settlement</a> [agreement, PDF] against the government in a <a href="http://www.cobellsettlement.com/docs/1996.06.10_Cobell_Complaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Cobell">news archive</a>] brought for its alleged mismanagement of American Indian trust funds.  The delay, the third since the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">settlement was reached</a> [JURIST report] in December, moves the congressional approval date from April 16 to May 28. Though Roberston approved the latest delay, he <a href="http://www.wfed.com/?nid=27&sid=1673221">warned</a> [AP report] government lawyers that this is the last delay he will grant, stating that he will summon Secretary of the Interior <a href="http://www.doi.gov/welcome.html">Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] if Congress fails to act within the time granted.  Pending congressional approval, the settlement will be the largest American Indian claim ever approved by the US government and will end a fourteen year legal battle.<br /><br />Congress established the Indian trust in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases of Indian lands. In July, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/gazette/2009/07/indian-trust-fund-doi-accounting-ruling.php">ordered</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-interior.php">report</a>] the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">US Department of Interior</a> [official website] to provide an accounting of the trust to the court. In 2008, Roberston <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/federal-judge-awards-native-americans.php">rejected</a> plaintiffs&#39; claims that the government had engaged in fraud, but <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-interior-department-unreasonably.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the DOI &quot;unreasonably delayed&quot; the accounting of billions of dollars of American Indian money. The case <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/century-old-american-indian-trust-claim.php">went to trial</a> [JURIST report] in June 2008, after the plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/indian-trust-plaintiffs-reject-7.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a 2007 settlement proposal from the government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/">US Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation</a> (MDL) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/Recent_Orders/Recent_Orders/MDL-2151-TransferOrder.pdf">consolidated</a> [order, PDF] more than <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0911156120100409">150</a> [Reuters report] pending lawsuits against <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota Motor Corporation</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=toyota">news archive</a>] and transferred them to the US <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website]. The MDL panel said that transferring the cases to California to be heard by <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/CACD/JudgeReq.nsf/0/90c0d42f0eda92ba88256d1d0058cff9/$FILE/Resume.pdf">Judge James Selna</a> [official profile, PDF] would make the litigation process more streamlined.<br /><blockquote><br />Each of the actions currently before the Panel asserts economic damages on behalf of certain classes and/or individuals stemming from an alleged defect in certain Toyota vehicles that causes sudden, unintended acceleration. The cases involve common questions of fact. No doubt, centralization under Section 1407 will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings, including with respect to class certification; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and the judiciary.<br /></blockquote><br />Other transfer options included US District Courts in the  <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">Eastern District of Louisiana</a>, and the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">Middle District of Florida</a> [official websites], where large numbers of cases against Toyota were filed. <br /><br />The <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website] said earlier this week that that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-dot-to-impose-record-civil-fine-on.php">seek</a> [JURIST report] a record <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot5910.htm">$16.375 million</a> [press release] penalty against Toyota for a four month delay in waiting to notify the agency about problems with allegedly &quot;sticky&quot; gas pedals. Toyota has two weeks to appeal the fine. Toyota has been under <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_viewID=detail_view&itemID=525a58d643767210VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&viewType=standard&detailViewURL=/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX">federal scrutiny</a> [NHTSA materials] since December and has recalled approximately eight million cars. Last month, California&#39;s <a href="http://orangecountyda.com/home/index.asp">Orange County District Attorney</a> [official website] filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/california-da-files-consumer-protection.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report]  that the company knowingly sold vehicles with acceleration defects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=13&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Azerbaijan&sessionid=50906581&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=18705/06&sessionid=50906883&skin=hudoc-pr-en">press release</a>] Thursday that Azerbaijan violated parliamentary candidate Namat Aliyev&#8217;s rights to stand freely and fairly in the country&#39;s 2005 elections. Aliyev alleged that the government violated his rights under Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which ensures the free expression of the people in the selection of a country&#39;s legislature. Aliyev accused the Azerbaijan electoral commission and courts of failing to thoroughly investigate irregularities and breaches of electoral law in the election. The ECHR found:<br /><blockquote>What was at stake in those proceedings was not only the alleged infringement of the applicant&#39;s individual rights but also, on a more general level, the State&#39;s compliance with its positive duty to hold free and fair elections. Therefore, even assuming that the courts in the present case might have been unable to decide the case solely on the basis of the evidence submitted by the applicant, the material put before them was nevertheless strong enough to require them to take additional steps to obtain more information and verify the accuracy of the applicant&#39;s allegations which cast doubt on the free and fair character of the elections in his constituency.</blockquote>The ECHR found support for its decision in a <a href="http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2006/02/17923_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by the<a href="http://www.osce.org/"> Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> [official website] on the elections. The ECHR ordered Azerbaijan to pay a <a href="http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/2006463.html">7,500 Euro fine </a>[RFE/RL report, in Azerbaijani].<br /><br />The Aliyev ruling is the 24th ECHR decision against Azerbaijan and comes as the country prepares to again hold parliamentary elections in November. Earlier this month, Popular Front Party leader Ali Karimli wrote an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/01/AR2010040103257.html">editorial</a> [WP op-ed] expressing concerns about the political situation in Azerbaijan. In March 2009, a referendum passed that eliminated term limits for the president. The referendum received <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/azerbaijan-parliament-approves.php">approval to proceed</a> [JURIST report] from parliament in December 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297402A1.pdf">announced</a> [press release, PDF] Thursday that it will move forward with the first phase of its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website, <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>] in 2010.  The <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/plan/broadband-action-agenda.html">2010 Broadband Action Agenda</a> [materials] lays out the steps the agency plans to take in order to make broadband internet access more available in the country. The announcement follows a federal court <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201004/08-1291-1238302.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">report</a>] Tuesday that the FCC lacks authority to enforce <a href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html">net neutrality</a> [Google backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">news archive</a>], a policy considered vital to the plan by many. FCC Chairman <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] said the plan could proceed despite the ruling:<br /><blockquote>The Commission&#39;s Bureaus and Offices have already begun executing on the strategy the National Broadband Plan lays out . . . The court decision earlier this week does not change our broadband policy goals, or the ultimate authority of the FCC to achieve those goals.  The court did not question the FCC&#39;s goals; it merely invalidated one technical, legal mechanism for broadband policy chosen by prior Commissions.</blockquote>The 2010 agenda also outlines steps toward numerous goals unrelated to net neutrality, including reclamation of 500 megahertz of open-air spectrum for mobile broadband applications, the creation of a public safety wireless broadband network and improved access to broadband service in rural and other underserved areas.<br /><br />The FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fcc-presents-broadband-regulation-plan.php">sent the plan</a> [JURIST report] to Congress for approval last month, seeking approval to enact regulations to update the communications infrastructure in the US and make broadband service available to millions more Americans.  The policy of net neutrality is <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">unanimously supported by the FCC&#39;s commissioners</a> [JURIST report] and is considered essential to the its goal of an open flow of information over the internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.  The policy has been vigorously opposed by telecommunications companies <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites], which argue that such rules would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic.  Other notable goals of the plan include providing 100 million households with affordable 100 megabits-per-second internet service and ensuring that all children are literate in digital technology by the time they leave high school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Thai court on Friday issued arrest warrants for at least 17 high-profile protesters in an attempt to put down violent protests. Among the accused are <a href="http://www.mcot.net/cfcustom/cache_page/42827.cfm">top leaders</a> [TNA report] of the the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, also known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The warrants are in addition to warrants issued Thursday for seven high-level protesters accused of <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/35814/warrants-out-for-7-raiders">being among a large group of protesters</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report] that entered the Parliament building during protests Wednesday. <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website, in Thai; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">BBC profile</a>] said he hopes that the arrest of the high-profile leaders will <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8610022.stm">cause other protesters to disperse</a> [BBC report].<br /><br />On Wednesday, Vejjajiva <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], giving the government increased ability to detain individuals and censor the media. The declaration came just days after a Thai <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-denies-injunction.php">court dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the government&#39;s application for an injunction against protesters gathered in Bangkok&#39;s business district. The injunction would have ordered protest organizers to lead the group out of the area and would have banned rallies in 11 other areas. The court denied the request stating that the <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/thailandinternalsecurityactdraftof16oct2007inenglish.pdf">Internal Security Act</a> [text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thailand-government-approves-use-of.php">approved by the Thai Cabinet</a> [JURIST report] in March, already gave the government eviction powers. The red shirts are supporters of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from  power</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 following a coup.  The group is demanding that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call new elections. Last April, Abhisit <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/thailand-pm-imposes-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and several provinces following a similar outbreak of protests calling for his resignation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday approved <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/055/10055.1-6.html">legislation</a> [text] authorizing the suspension of internet service for those who repeatedly download copyrighted material illegally. The act also received <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100408-0013.htm#10040856001075">Royal Assent</a> [text] and is now law. The <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html">Digital Economy Bill</a> [legislative materials] calls on internet service providers (ISPs) to block download sites, reduce a user&#39;s broadband speeds, and ultimately shut down a user&#39;s internet access in order to prevent piracy of copyrighted materials. The bill, known as a three-strikes law, imposes stricter penalties on repeat digital offenders than had previously existed, and has received a great deal of <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article7093203.ece">public criticism</a> [TimesOnline report]. Certain ISPs have even threatened to not comply with the law, but MPs who support it say it is a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/09/digital-economy-bill-backlash">necessary step</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] to protect the creators of digital content.<br /><br />Online piracy has assumed increasing importance in the eyes of legislators across Europe, and many countries, including France, have enacted similar legislation. A recent report, however, suggests that the French anti-piracy bill may actually lead to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-internet-piracy-increasing.php">increased piracy</a> [JURIST report]. The French bill was <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=" edu="" paperchase="" 2009="" 10="">approved by the Constitutional Court in October</a> after being given <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/france-parliament-gives-final-approval.php">final approval by the French Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] the previous month. Under the French law, the government could send notices to Internet service providers to terminate an individual&#39;s internet access for up to one year after a third violation of intellectual property laws for downloading or sharing movies and music.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced Thursday that <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/speeches/2010/ag-speech-100408.html">Spain has agreed to resettle four detainees</a> [press release] from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facility. The four detainees are in addition to a Palestinian detainee <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">transferred to Spain</a> [JURIST report] earlier this year. The governments have yet to decide which detainees will be transferred. Holder met with Spanish <a href="http://www.la-moncloa.es/IDIOMAS/9/Presidente/Biografia/default.htm">Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero</a> [official profile] during his visit to Spain to discuss issues of counter-terrorism and combating international organized crime. Holder also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Prosecutor General Conde-Pumpido to strengthen the ability of law enforcement officials to work cooperatively within each others&#39; countries.<br /><br />In February, Spanish <a href="http://www.maec.es/en/MenuPpal/Ministerio/ElMinistro/Biografia/Paginas/Bibliografia.aspx">Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos</a> [official profile] initially agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/spain-to-accept-5-guantanamo-detainees.php">accept five detainees</a> after the government had previously agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-to-take-two-guantanamo-bay.php">accept only two detainees</a> [JURIST reports], one Yemeni and one Palestinian, in response to a June <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20090618-us-asks-spain-take-four-guantanamo-inmates-prison-terrorism-">request</a> [AFP report] by the Obama administration. Moratinos <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/confirma/Espana/acogera/presos/Guantanamo/elpepuesp/20100215elpepunac_3/Tes">indicated</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] that Spain was willing to increase the number of detainees accepted in order to help remedy what it sees as an unacceptable situation at the detention facility. Spain joins a growing list of countries that have recently accepted transfers, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">Algeria</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a> , <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">Albania</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australian <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/">Immigration Minister Chris Evans</a> [official website] announced Friday that that his country will <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/media-releases/2010/ce10029.htm">temporarily suspend</a> [press release] processing all asylum claims from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. Evans, a cabinet minister under <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/">Prime Minister Kevin Rudd</a> [official website], said that Afghani and Sri Lankan asylum seekers would be denied entry because of improved security situations in those countries. Sri Lankan asylum claims processing would be  will be suspended for three months, while Afghani claims will be suspended for six months, after which the policy will be reviewed in light of security assessments from the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website]. Evans said that the new procedures are intended to ensure that &quot;Australia&#39;s refugee processing system continues to recognise those genuinely in need of our protection.&quot; The policy will not affect those refugees already on Christmas Island, a key processing center for unauthorized immigrants. Refugees from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan account for <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/legal-bid-likely-on-refugees-20100410-rzy5.html">80 percent</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span> report] of all asylum claims filed in Australia. Opposition parties have criticized the new policy as an <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/kevin-rudd-shuts-refugee-door/story-e6frgczf-1225852045905">election maneuver</a>  [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> report] meant to get more votes. Rights groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au">Australian Human Rights Commission</a> (AHRC) [advocacy websites] have <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/australia-asylum-suspension-could-harm-worlds-most-vulnerable-2010-04-09">expressed concerns</a> [press release] about the policy&#39;s effect on legitimate asylum seekers.<br /><br />Australia announced this week that they would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/australia-to-accept-cuban-aslyum.php">accept three Cuban refugees</a> [JURIST report]  held at the Guantanamo Bay Migration Operations Center, which is not affiliated at the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Naval Detention Center</a> [JURIST news archive] at Guantanamo Bay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Senate Judiciary Committee chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] predicted Sunday that President Obama will nominate a replacement for <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/viewpressreleases.aspx?FileName=pr_04-09-10.html">retiring</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/justice-stevens-to-retire-from-us.php">report</a>] Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Justice John Paul Stevens</a> [official profile; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/author.php?stevens">materials</a>] in time for hearings to be concluded over the summer. In an <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36362669/ns/meet_the_press">appearance</a> [transcript] with Ranking Member <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/public/">Jeff Sessions</a> (R-AL) [official website] on NBC&#39;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; discussed the coming confirmation battle over the replacement for Stevens, who announced Friday that he would retire at the end of the court&#39;s 2009 term this summer. Leahy said &quot;I think we&#39;re going to hear [a nomination] soon enough so that we can wrap this up this summer.&quot; Sessions would not rule out the possibility of a Republican filibuster of the nominee, however, saying: <blockquote>[I]f we have a nominee that evidences a philosophy of &quot;judges know best,&quot; that they can amend the Constitution by saying it has evolved, and effectuate agendas, then we&#39;re going to have a big fight about that because the American people don&#39;t want that.</blockquote> <a href="http://kyl.senate.gov/">Senator Jon Kyl</a> (R-AZ) [official profile] expressed similar sentiments in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-secretaries-gates-clinton/story?id=10343909">appearance</a> [transcript] on ABC&#39;s &quot;This Week&quot; Sunday where he would not rule out the possibility of a filibuster against a nominee that &quot;com[es] to the bench with an ideological position,&quot; but described the filibuster as &quot;unlikely.&quot;<br /><br />In a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WSJ-20100409-StevensLetter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Obama explaining is retirement, Stevens wrote, &quot;it would be in the best interests of the Court to have my successor appointed and confirmed well in advance of the commencement of the Court&#39;s next Term.&quot; There had been much speculation about Stevens&#39;s possible retirement, and leading candidates for his replacement reportedly include <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/">Solicitor General Elena Kagan</a> [official profile] and federal appellate Judges Merrick Garland and Diane Wood. Stevens, 89, was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Gerald Ford and was seated in December 1975. He previously served on the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Stevens is the court&#39;s oldest and most senior member and has served as the leader of the court&#39;s liberal bloc. His retirement gives Obama his second opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice, following last year&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/justice-souter-to-retire-from-us.php">retirement of Justice David Souter</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/senate-confirms-sotomayor-for-supreme.php">confirmation of Justice Sonia Sotomayor</a> [JURIST reports].

Komorowski must now <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Acting+president+announce+poll+date+soon/2787888/story.html">announce</a> [Reuters report] the date of the next presidential elections within two weeks. The elections must be held within two months of the official announcement. Under Article 131 of the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/pl00000_.html#A131_">Polish Constitution</a> [text], the &quot;Marshal of the House of Representatives (Sejm) shall, until the time of election of a new President of the Republic, temporarily discharge the duties of the President of the Republic.&quot; In his first official act, Komorowski <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7094125.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797093">declared a week of national mourning</a> [Times Online report] for those who died in the plane crash, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-fg-polish-president-crash11-2010apr11,0,4409138.story?page=1">including</a> [LAT report] the Polish military chief of staff, the president of the national bank, the deputy foreign minister, the deputy parliament speaker, the civil rights commissioner, and several members of parliament.<br /><br />In primary elections held in March, Komorowski was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gRR-2c1nm_b7JiuYNzibdYbTi7OQD9EMVC100">chosen</a> [AP report] as the presidential candidate for the current ruling party, <a href="http://www.platforma.org/">Civic Platform</a> [party website]. At the time, it was uncertain whether Kaczynski would run for re-election. Kaczynski and the other 89 passengers of the plane that crashed on Saturday were traveling to Katyn, where they were to participate in a memorial service for the victims of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=katyn">1940 massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], in which 20,000 Poles were killed by the USSR. In February, the Polish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/poland-government-joins-suit-against.php">joined a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] alleging that the Russian government failed to provide adequate investigations into the incident and did not grant victim status to 13 relatives of those killed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] late last week made public two previously unreleased rulings relating to habeas corpus claims by Guantanamo detainees. In a decision ordering the release of <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/760-mohamedou-ould-slahi/">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</a> [NYT materials], Judge James Robertson held that the government had to release Slahi because it was unable to prove that he was part of, or provided support to, <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/al-qaeda.htm">al-Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] at the time of his capture. Applying a test articulated by Judge John Bates in <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1236-116">Hamlily v. Obama</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-judge-rejects-new-government.php">report</a>], which limited the detention of terrorism suspects who are not actual members of terrorist groups under the 2001 <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF], and rejected the Obama administration&#39;s &quot;substantial support&quot; standard, Robertson explained:<blockquote>[A] habeas court may not permit a man to be held indefinitely upon suspicion, or because of the government&#39;s prediction that he may do unlawful acts in the future - any more than a habeas court may rely upon its prediction that a man will not be dangerous in the future and order his release if he was lawfully detained in the first place. The question ... was whether, <u>at the time of his capture</u>, [Slahi] was &quot;part of&quot; al-Qa[e]da. On the record before me, I cannot find that he was.</blockquote> The government <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/09/AR2010040905050.html">plans to appeal</a> [WP report] the decision. On Thursday, the court released the <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2009cv2368-16">decision</a> [text, PDF] of another judge in the <em>habeas</em> petition of Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/117-muktar-yahya-najee-al-warafi">Muktar Yahya Najee al Warafi</a> [NYT materials]. The court rejected Warafi&#39;s claim that his detention violated the AUMF and Article 24 of the <a href="http://icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/fe20c3d903ce27e3c125641e004a92f3">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> [text]. The court found that the government did have enough proof to hold him under the AUMF, and that the Geneva Conventions may not be invoked in a <em>habeas</em> proceeding. Also on Thursday, a third district court judge <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1254-801">rejected</a> [order, PDF] the <em>habeas</em> petition of <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/522-yasin-qasem-muhammad-ismail">Yasin Qasem Muhammad Ismail</a> [NYT materials], but the full decision has yet to be released. <br /><br />The court originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Slahi in March. Slahi was once considered a key al-Qaeda leader and prosecutors had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704841304575138013356640710.html">sought the death penalty against him</a> [WSJ report]. A prominent government prosecutor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/536/guantanamo-justice.html">stepped down from the case</a> [PBS interview] because he did not support the alleged abusive treatment used against Slahi, which was investigated in a 2008 <a href="http://documents.nytimes.com/report-by-the-senate-armed-services-committee-on-detainee-treatment#document/p139">Senate Armed Services Committee report</a> [text, PDF]. Last May, Judge Gladys Kessler <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-judge-adopts-new-standard-in.php">applied the &quot;substantially supported&quot; standard</a> [JURIST report] for reviewing <em>habeas</em> petitions filed by detainees, making no reference to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enemy+combatant">&quot;enemy combatant&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] classification used previously. Last April, Judge Reggie Walton <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/federal-judge-adopts-obama.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] the &quot;substantially supported&quot; standard for authorizing and reviewing the detention of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo.

In a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WSJ-20100409-StevensLetter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to President Barack Obama, Stevens wrote, &quot;it would be in the best interests of the Court to have my successor appointed and confirmed well in advance of the commencement of the Court&#39;s next Term.&quot; There had been much speculation about Stevens&#39;s possible retirement, and leading candidates for his replacement reportedly include <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/">Solicitor General Elena Kagan</a> [official profile] and federal appellate Judges Merrick Garland and Diane Wood.<br /><br />Stevens, 89, was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Gerald Ford and was seated in December 1975. He previously served on the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Stevens is the court&#39;s oldest and most senior member and has served as the leader of the court&#39;s liberal bloc. His retirement gives Obama his second opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice, following last year&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/justice-souter-to-retire-from-us.php">retirement of Justice David Souter</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/senate-confirms-sotomayor-for-supreme.php">confirmation of Justice Sonia Sotomayor</a> [JURIST reports].<br /><br />3:40 PM ET - In a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-retirement-justice-stevens-and-west-virginia-mining-tragedy">statement</a> [text] later Friday, Obama thanked Stevens for his service and said he would seek a successor with qualities similar to those he saw in Stevens:<blockquote>Once again, I view the process of selecting a Supreme Court nominee as among my most serious responsibilities as President.  And while we cannot replace Justice Stevens&#8217; experience or wisdom, I will seek someone in the coming weeks with similar qualities -- an independent mind, a record of excellence and integrity, a fierce dedication to the rule of law, and a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people.  It will also be someone who, like Justice Stevens, knows that in a democracy, powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens.  Much like they did with Justice Sotomayor, I hope the Senate will move quickly in the coming weeks to debate and then confirm my nominee so that the new Justice is seated in time for the fall term.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former South Korean <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Han-Myung-sook_V02W.html">Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook</a> [<em>Forbes</em> profile] was acquitted Friday of bribery charges by the Seoul Central District Court. Han <a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100409000650">was accused</a> [<em>Korean Herald</em> report] of accepting $50,000 from former <a href="http://www.korex.co.kr/eng/index.jsp">Korea Express</a> CEO Kwak Young-wook in 2007 in exchange for helping him become president of Korea South-East Power Co., an affiliate of the state-run <a href="http://www.kepco.co.kr/eng/">Korea Electric Power Corporation</a> [corporate websites]. The prosecution had relied on Kwak&#39;s testimony as the primary evidence against Han, but the court found his statements contradictory and unconvincing. It also found Kwak guilty of embezzlement charges unrelated to the bribery charges against Han. Han&#39;s supporters hope that <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-04/09/c_13244276.htm">the acquittal</a> [Xinhua report] will help the opposition leader politically, as she plans to run for mayor in upcoming June elections. The prosecution plans to appeal the decision.<br /><br />The acquittal temporarily ends legal troubles for the former prime minister. In December, Han was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/south-korea-former-pm-indicted-on.php">indicted for bribery</a> the week after a court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/south-korea-court-issues-arrest-warrant.php">issued a warrant</a> [JURIST reports] for her arrest. Han served as the country&#39;s first female prime minister under president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2535143.stm">Roh Moo-hyun</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Roh+Moo-hyun">news archive</a>]. Roh, who was himself the target of a bribery investigation, <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/south-korea-ex-president-targeted-by.php">died</a> [JURIST report] in May from an apparent suicide. Shortly before his death, prosecutors had questioned Roh on suspicion that he accepted up to $6 million in bribes from Park Yeon-cha, a financial supporter who is also CEO of a shoe manufacturing company.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Seven Icelandic government officials acted with gross negligence in their management of the country&#39;s financial system prior to a 2008 bank collapse, according to a <a href="http://rna.althingi.is/">report</a> [materials, in Icelandic] released Monday by a parliamentary panel. The Special Investigation Committee (SIC), convened in 2008 by the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/vefur/upplens.html">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website] to investigate the collapse of the country&#39;s three largest banks, determined that then-Prime Minister <a href="http://www.althingi.is/cv.php4?nfaerslunr=162">Geir Haarde</a> and former central bank head <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/thingm/1701487469.html?knt=1701487469">David Oddsson</a> [official profiles, in Icelandic] knew that banks were assuming overseas debt but took no action to prevent or mitigate the effects of the accumulation.  The SIC also found that former Minister of Finance Arni Mathiessen, then-banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, former <a href="http://www.fme.is/?PageID=146">Financial Services Authority</a> [official website] director Jonas Jonsson and central bank officials Eirikur Gundason and Ingimundur Fridriksson failed to take appropriate action when presented with information about the poor state of the country&#39;s financial sector.

A parliamentary panel will decide whether to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63B33H20100412">take legal action</a> [Reuters report] against the officials.<br /><br />Iceland was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7658908.stm">hit hard</a> [BBC backgrounder] by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Financial+Crisis">financial crisis</a> [JURIST news archive] that emanated from securities related to the US mortgage market.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Senator <a href="http://alexander.senate.gov/public/">Lamar Alexander</a> (R-Tenn) [official website] on Sunday said that Senate approval of the so-called <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf">New START treaty</a> [text, PDF; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8605857.stm">backgrounder</a>] will not happen this year. Speaking on a morning talk show, Alexander <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,590744,00.html">stated</a> [transcript], &quot;there&#39;s not a chance the treaty will be approved this year. It took a year and a half to approve the START I treaty.&quot; The new START treaty replaces the expired <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/arms/starthtm/start/toc.html">Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty</a> (START I treaty) [materials], with Russia and the United States each pledging to reduce their countries&#39; nuclear warheads by about 30 percent. Under the terms of the treaty and its protocol, both countries would only be allowed to deploy 1,550 strategic warheads, a decrease from the 2,200 currently permitted. Reaction to the new treaty has been mixed. UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4482">called</a> [press release] it a &quot;significant achievement,&quot; while Senator <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official website] expressed reservations. Appearing with Alexander on Fox News, Lieberman indicated he did not believe that START would have Senate support unless the Obama administration committed to modernize the existing nuclear arsenal, stating: <blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that there will be 67 votes to ratify the START treaty unless the administration does two things &#8212; first, commit to modernize our nuclear stockpile so as we have less nuclear weapons we know they&#39;re capable, if, God forbid, we need them; and secondly, to make absolutely clear that some of the statements by Russian president Medvedev at the signing in Prague that seem to suggest that if we continue to build the ballistic missile defense in Europe that they may pull out of this treaty &#8212; they&#39;re just unacceptable to us. We need that defense to protect our allies and ourselves from Iran. </blockquote> President Obama is expected to submit the treaty to the Senate in early May and Senate Democrats have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iHVfEaiHCF28fIqP1jSXH004GDMw">indicated</a> [AFP report] they will then begin hearings with the aim of ratifying the treaty within the year. <br /><br />US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in Prague last Thursday. The treaty agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years. The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. Nuclear disarmament between the US and Russia, whose nuclear arsenals comprise 95 percent of the world&#39;s nuclear weapons, languished during the Bush administration. The treaty is considered a key part of easing tensions between the two countries, which reached a high point after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/europe/2008/georgia_russia_conflict/default.stm">2008 Georgia conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.vatican.va/index.htm">Vatican</a> [official website] on Monday released <a href="http://www.vatican.va/resources/resources_guide-CDF-procedures_en.html">Church procedures</a> [text] for handling alleged cases of sexual abuse by priests, instructing, &quot;Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed.&quot; The &quot;Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations&quot; summarizes the procedures governing investigations by the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_pro_14071997_en.html">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> (CDF) [official profile] into allegations of sex abuse by clergy members. The CDF guidelines provide for interim measures meant to ensure the safety of others during civil authorities&#39; investigations or legal proceedings: <br /><blockquote><br />During the preliminary stage and until the case is concluded, the bishop may impose precautionary measures to safeguard the community, including the victims. Indeed, the local bishop always retains power to protect children by restricting the activities of any priest in his diocese.  This is part of his ordinary authority, which he is encouraged to exercise to whatever extent is necessary to assure that children do not come to harm, and this power can be exercised at the bishop&#39;s discretion before, during and after any canonical proceeding. <br /></blockquote><br />The guidelines also outline a multi-tiered system of enforcement and appeals, including local bishops, the CDF, and the Pope himself. <br /><br />Since 2007, in the US alone the Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled over 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of abuse for over $900 million. In April 2001, Pope John Paul II issued the <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/resources/resource-files/churchdocs/SacramentorumAndNormaeEnglish.htm">Motu Proprio Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela</a> (MP SST) [text], which gave the CDF responsibility for overseeing the Church&#39;s approach to instances of sexual abuse. That document was prepared by Cardinal Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.  The <a href="http://www.usccb.org/">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a> (USCCB) [official website] reports having received allegations from 14,000 victims against 5,600 priests between 1950-2008.  The official numbers are found in the 2004 <a href="http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/index.htm">John Jay Report</a> [text] commissioned by the USCCB and the subsequent <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2009/03_04/audit_report_2008t.pdf">implementation report</a> [text, PDF] from 2008. <a href="http://www.bishop-accountability.org/AtAGlance/data.htm#victimized_children">Estimates</a> [BishopAccountability.org report] of the total number of US children who were abused since 1950 range from 25,000 to close to 300,000.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama&#8217;s nominee to head the Justice Department&#39;s <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> (OLC) [official website] withdrew her candidacy on Friday. <a href="http://info.law.indiana.edu/sb/page/normal/1419.html">Dawn Johnsen</a> [professional profile], <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-appoints-clinton-era-lawyers-to.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] as the OLC&#39;s Assistant Attorney General in January 2009, has faced over a year of objection from Republicans for her criticisms of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">interrogation methods</a> [JURIST news archive] approved by the OLC during the Bush administration and her support of abortion rights. In March, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] for the second time recommended her to the Senate for <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/nominations/111thCongressExecutiveNominations/AssistantAttorneyGeneralOLC-DawnJohnsen.cfm">confirmation</a> [materials] on a strict party-line vote. However, it is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5imFJM9mzg4Z84RP3Hg0fJs2Pl8OQD9EVQ1CG0">unlikely</a> [AP report] that Johnsen would have been able to obtain the votes necessary for confirmation and overcome a possible filibuster. The White House <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/10/us/politics/10johnsen.html">refrained from appointing</a> [NYT report] Johnsen during the Senate recess last month, which would have avoided the confirmation process. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said that the Senate should put politics aside and bring impartial legal advice back to the OLC.<br /><br />Johnsen, who previously served as acting head of the OLC under former president Bill Clinton, argued to restore the OLC&#8217;s reputation and political independence. Under the Bush administration, OLC lawyers <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.law.unlv.edu/faculty/jay-bybee.html">Jay Bybee</a> [academic profile] produced <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=torture+memos">confidential memos</a> [JURIST news archive] authorizing the use of controversial CIA interrogation techniques that critics have called torture. Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/sketch08index.html">Chairman Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profile] said at a February hearing that he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/leahy-calls-for-release-of-doj-e-mails.php">prepared to subpoena</a> [JURIST report] the DOJ if it did not turn over missing e-mail records dealing with the so-called &quot;torture memos.&quot; In February, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-concludes-bush-administration.php">overruled</a> the findings of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-ethics-report-clears-bush.php">report</a> [JURIST reports] concluding that Yoo and Bybee committed professional misconduct. Instead, the DOJ said that they were only guilty of &quot;poor judgment&quot; in writing the memos. Former US attorney general John Ashcroft has defended the advice the DOJ gave the Bush administration on the use of certain interrogation techniques, saying that all guidelines issued by his office were legal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Monday released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR01/012/2010/en/608f128b-9eac-4e2f-b73b-6d747a8cbaed/eur010122010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] criticizing some European nations&#39; practice of seeking &quot;no-torture&quot; assurances from other countries in order to remove foreigners. According to the report, the assurances are used to return people to countries with records of human rights abuses. AI described these deals as unreliable and unenforceable, and called for an end to their use. The report was particularly critical of the UK, which for 18 years has used the method to deport people who were considered national security threats. AI described the UK as:<br /><blockquote><br />[T]he most influential and aggressive promoter of...the use of diplomatic assurances to forcibly return people it considers threats to national security...The promotion of [this] policy...has occurred at a number of levels: as a matter of domestic policy[,]...at the European Court of Human Rights[,]...and [at] a number of intergovernmental forums[,]...[despite criticism] by the UN Human Rights Committee and the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights.<br /></blockquote> <br />A UK government spokesperson <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8614626.stm">responded to the report</a> [BBC report], asserting that the use of &quot;no-torture&quot; agreements is necessary to maintain national security, and stating that the government would not enter into an agreement if it perceived a torture risk. The AI report also criticized several other European nations for using these assurances, including Denmark, Germany, France, and Italy, who continue to do so <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jQwDMYdwegkPR8kqcx4_pREShftw">despite negative rulings</a> [AFP report] on the practice from the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].<br /><br />In March, AI, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/">Liberty</a>, and <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy websites] joined with members of British parliament in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-mps-rights-groups-call-for-torture.php">calling for an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=UK+torture">UK role in torture</a> [JURIST news archive] and rendition during the war on terror. They called on British officials to conduct a public hearing on the role played by UK intelligence agencies and armed forces in the alleged torture and rendition of terror suspects.  British <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/meet-the-pm">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5238202.stm">profile</a>] has faced scrutiny over UK procedures amid allegations that British intelligence officials were involved in the torture of former <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=binyam+mohamed">news archive</a>] in Morocco. In February, Reprieve <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-rights-group-suing-government-over.php">initiated a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the British government, claiming that its unwillingness to disclose detainee policies suggests that it permits illegal torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Tuesday resumed the war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>]. The proceedings commenced with the prosecution calling its first witness, Bosnian Muslim <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/custom11/en/karadzic_otp_witness_info.pdf">Ahmet Zulic</a> [witness list, PDF]. Zulic provided testimony concerning the 1992 attack on his village of Sanski Most at the beginning of the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_bosnia.html">Bosnian war</a> [PPU backgrounder]. Zulic testified that his father was burned alive by Serb insurgents and that he witnessed Serbs force 20 Muslim men to dig their own graves before executing them. The prosecution alleges that Karadzic was responsible for coordinating the invasion. Zulic has previously testified about the general political situation in Sanski Most and about the brutal conditions, beatings, and killings in the detention facilities in which he was held, including in the trial of former Serbian president <a href="http://www.biography.com/articles/Slobodan-Milosevic-9409281">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [Biography profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">news archive</a>]. Zulic will be cross-examined by Karadzic, who is serving as his own defense counsel. The prosecution&#39;s 11 remaining witness will take the stand in the coming weeks.<br /><br />Last week, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/karadzic-fails-in-latest-bid-to-delay.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report]  Kardzic&#39;s latest motion to delay court proceedings, in which he argued that there had been a violation of his right to a fair hearing because the court had rejected previous evidentiary challenges. In March, Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/icty-denies-karadzic-appeal-to-delay.php">lost another motion</a> [JURIST report] to postpone his war crimes trial on charges related to crimes committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Karadzic claimed that a February ruling increasing the remuneration for his defense lawyers should also give him extra time to prepare for his case. Karadzic is defending himself against <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 counts</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide and murder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Florida <a href="http://www.myfloridalegal.com/">Attorney General Bill McCollum</a> [official website] announced Tuesday that <a href="http://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/814FC1F721A8B9B1852577040067BCA2">Georgia will join</a> [press release] 18 other states in a <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/MRAY-83TKWB/$file/HealthCareReformLawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the constitutionality of the recently enacted <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">health care bill</a> [HR 3590 materials].  The lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">originally filed</a> [JURIST report] last month in the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website]. McCollum issued a statement welcoming Georgia to the judicial efforts, reiterating the states&#39; belief that the health care bill is unconstitutional, and stating plans to take the suit to the Supreme Court if necessary:<br /><blockquote><br />We welcome Georgia to our efforts to protect the constitutional rights of our citizens as well as the sovereignty of our states. The federal government cannot mandate that all citizens buy qualifying health care coverage or be forced to pay a tax penalty - this is unconstitutional. We will aggressively pursue this lawsuit to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to prevent this unprecedented expansion of federal powers, impact upon state sovereignty, and encroachment on our freedom. </blockquote><br />The 18 other states involved in the suit are Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, Utah, Alabama, South Dakota, Idaho, Indiana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada, and Arizona.<br /><br />Georgia joins the suit after Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced last week that Indiana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Nevada and Arizona would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/texas-ag-5-more-states-to-join-health.php">joining the suit</a> [JURIST report]. Among the allegations in the complaint are violations of Article I and the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution as well as the commerce clause. Last month, Idaho Governor CL Otter <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/idaho-governor-first-to-sign-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] barring the federal mandate to purchase health insurance.  Virginia Governor Bob McDonald has indicated that he will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/virginia-legislature-passes-bill.php">sign a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] recently passed by  the Virginia legislature. Also in March, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-amendments.php">signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act</a> [JURIST report] into law, which addressed concerns raised by the original bill, including provisions to help uninsured Americans pay for coverage, concerns over the effects to Medicare, and lowering the penalty for not buying insurance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/">Nebraska Legislature</a> [official website] voted 44-5 on Tuesday to approve the <a href="http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=10024">Abortion Pain Prevention Act</a> [LB1103 materials; <a href="http://unicameralupdate.blogspot.com/2010/04/20-week-abortion-ban-approved.html">press release</a>] prohibiting an <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] at or past 20 weeks. The law is based on medical evidence that allegedly indicates a fetus can feel pain following that point and goes beyond the previous state law that prohibited abortions at approximately 24 weeks based on the fetus&#39;s ability to live outside the womb. The legislation allows a patient or the father of a fetus to sue a doctor for actual damages when the act is violated. Nebraska <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/index.html">Governor Dave Heineman</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/news/2010/04/13_pro_life.html">signed</a> [press release] the legislation the same day along with another <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/bills/view_bill.php?DocumentID=6605">bill</a> [LB 594 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-legislature-approves-bill.php">report</a>] approved Monday that would require health care professionals to determine if a woman seeking the abortion had been pressured into the procedure and would also require them to assess the woman for additional risk factors that could lead to mental or physical complications.<br /><br />The Abortion Pain Prevention Act makes Nebraska the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Supreme_Court/nebraska-passes-controversial-abortion-ban/story?id=10361705">first state to prohibit</a> [ABC report] an abortion based on the idea that a fetus can feel pain as early as 20 weeks. The Nebraska laws join <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">recent anti-abortion laws</a> [JURIST report] passed in Oklahoma, which prohibit abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus, protect medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs, and regulate the use of RU-486, or mifepristone, a chemical used in abortion procedures. Advocacy groups have <a href="/hotline/#5939865606985017885">criticized</a> [JURIST comment] the Oklahoma laws and promised to challenge them in court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/04/09/08-15969.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that federal prisoners are not entitled to a base level of compensation for work performed while incarcerated. <u>Serra v. Lappin</u> grew out of a challenge brought by attorney J. Tony Serra, who was imprisoned for failure to pay federal taxes. Serra and two fellow plaintiffs claimed that their rights were violated according to the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/Constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution and various sources of international law.  Judge Richard R. Clifton delivered the opinion of the Court:<br /><blockquote><br />We conclude that prisoners have no enforceable right to be paid for their work under the Constitution or international law, and we affirm the district court&#39;s dismissal of the action...The Constitution does not provide prisoners any substantive entitlement to compensation for their labor...Although the Constitution includes, in the Thirteenth Amendment,a general prohibition against involuntary servitude, it expressly excepts from that general prohibition forced labor &quot;as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.&quot; <br /></blockquote><br />In addition to rejecting a cause of action on the basis of the Constitution, the Court also ruled that the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], a UN document entitled <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36e8.html">Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners</a> [text] and the law of nations &quot;do not confer judicially enforceable rights.&quot; <br /><br />In February, the Ninth Circuit held that <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-inmate.php">inmate strip searches are constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. That court also <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-washington.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/01/05/06-35669.pdf">opinion</a>, PDF] in January that a Washington state law that prohibited felons from voting violated <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/voting/sec_2/about_sec2.php">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday upheld a National Court decision suspending an investigation into a 2002 Israeli air force bombing in the Gaza Strip. The attack killed 15 people, including 14 civilians. The investigation was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-to-investigate-israeli-role.php">ordered</a> in January 2009 after a National Court judge determined that the alleged bombing merited judicial investigation, but was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/spain-court-suspends-investigation-into.php">suspended</a> [JURIST reports] by the National Court in June. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision puts a <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Supremo/cierra/definitivamente/causa/Israel/matanza/civiles/elpepuint/20100413elpepuint_11/Tes">definitive end</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] to the controversial investigation. <br /><br />The decision to suspend the investigation overruled a May 2009 <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200905/04/espana/20090504elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/spain-judge-orders-investigation-of.php">report</a>] by National Court judge <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andreu">Fernando Andreu</a> [JURIST news archive] to continue the investigation despite legal challenges. The court&#39;s decision to suspend the investigation was based on a determination that the court lacked jurisdiction because Israel was already investigating the incident. Spain&#39;s use of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] in similar investigations has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-may-legislate-to-limit-universal.php">criticized</a> in the past, leading to the passage of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">legislation</a> [JURIST reports] to limit the scope of universal jurisdiction to cases in which the victims of a crime include Spaniards or the alleged perpetrators were in Spain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Dutch <a href="http://www.government.nl/Government/Balkenende_IV_Government/Jan_Peter_Balkenende">Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende</a> [official profile] on Monday proposed the establishment of an international tribunal in the Netherlands to try countries suspected of supplying nuclear materials to terrorists. The tribunal would be set in The Hague, already home to several international judicial institutions, and would hold accountable nations that <a href="http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/6511363/__Balkenende_wil_nucleair_tribunaal__.html?p=32,1">break international nuclear security treaties</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraaf</span> report, in Dutch]. A &quot;nuclear court&quot; would have to be established by a special treaty. According to Balkenende, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] reacted positively to the proposal during the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/12/effort-achieve-nuclear-security-0">Nuclear Security Summit</a> [WH blog] currently being held in Washington, DC. The two-day, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/world-leaders-and-heads-delegation-attending-nuclear-security-summit">47-nation</a> [press release] international summit is intended to pursue a comprehensive nuclear security agenda while addressing concerns that terrorist organizations could <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8616855.stm">obtain nuclear material</a> [BBC report].<br /><br />Continuing to make progress to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, Obama and Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-russia-presidents-sign-nuclear-arms.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the so-called <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/140035.pdf">New START treaty</a> [text, PDF; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8605857.stm">backgrounder</a>] last week, pledging to reduce their countries&#39; nuclear warheads by about 30 percent. Reaction to the new treaty has been mixed. US <a href="http://alexander.senate.gov/public/">Senator Lamar Alexander</a> (R-TN) [official website] on Sunday said that Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-senator-predicts-no-approval-of.php">approval of the treaty</a> [JURIST report] is unlikely to happen this year. <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Senator Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official website] also expressed reservations, while UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4482">called</a> [press release] it a &quot;significant achievement.&quot; The US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/state-department-to-negotiate-russia.php">began negotiating</a> [JURIST report] the treaty with Russia in 2009. The treaty agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-russia-agree-on-nuclear-arms.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in February, is the first nuclear agreement between the two nations in nearly 20 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kyrgyz interim prime minister Azimbek Beknazarov announced Tuesday that the temporary government has suspended the country&#39;s highest court until the country creates a permanent government. Beknazarov said that the Constitutional Court will remain <a href="http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100413/158553214.html">temporarily dissolved</a> [RIA Novosti report] because it allegedly supports ousted president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile]. Beknazarov also warned Bakiyev on Tuesday that he <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/174599/ousted-kyrgyz-premier-given-ultimatum-to-surrender">no longer has presidential protection</a> [AFP report] from legal proceedings and that he would be arrested and face criminal investigation if he did not step down as president. A Kyrgyz court also <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/63784/">issued arrest warrants</a> [Interfax report] for Bakiyev&#39;s brother and son and the country&#39;s former prime minister. In response, Bakiyev said Tuesday that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8617729.stm">he would admit defeat</a> [BBC report] if the interim government assured the safety of his family. Bakiyev offered to meet with interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] and called on the international community to investigate last week&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">coup</a> [JURIST report]. <br /><br />Last week, former Kyrgyz foreign minister Otunbayeva announced that she will lead an interim government in Kyrgyzstan after <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">violent protests</a> [JURIST report] apparently ousted Bakiyev and his administration. Otunbayeva, leader of the <a href="http://sdpk.info/ru/">Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan</a> [party website, in Russian], said that her temporary government <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/08/kyrgyzstan-opposition-demands-bakiyev-resignation">will rule for six months</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] until the country holds democratic elections. Reports vary as to the number of citizens killed during the protests, with Kyrgyz opposition officials reporting <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/174599/ousted-kyrgyz-premier-given-ultimatum-to-surrender">more than 80 deaths and more than 1600 injuries</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Times</span> report]. Also last week, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] announced that he will send an envoy to Kyrgyzstan and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34299&Cr=kyrgyzstan&Cr1=">encouraged calm</a> [UN News Centre report] in the unstable country. Rights groups have also urged leaders to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/07/kyrgyzstan-uphold-rights-while-restoring-order">respect human rights</a> [HRW press release].

The protests, prompted in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, led to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D0YG20100414">at least 84 deaths</a> [Reuters report] and many more injuries. It is <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/04/201041482412294846.html">not yet clear</a> [Al Jazeera report] whether the interim government will seek to have Bakiyev arrested or prosecuted. While Bakiyev has not formally announced whether he will resign, he has indicated that he is willing to cooperate with the interim government to bring a peaceful resolution to the current political tensions. <br /><br />On Tuesday, Kyrgyzstan&#39;s interim government announced that the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-suspends.php">highest court will be suspended</a> [JURIST report] until a permanent government is established. Roza Otunbayeva launched the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">interim government</a> [JURIST report] last week after the violent protests forced Bakiyev to flee the capital. The protests came just one week after UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] urged Kyrgyzstan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">protect all forms of human rights</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;free speech and freedom of the media.&quot; Ban depicted some <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20100403/158422410.html">recent events</a> [RIA Novosti report] in Kyrgyzstan as &quot;troubling,&quot; including the shutdown of an opposition newspaper, a police raid on a local television station that resulted in the station being taken off the air, and the confiscation of computers from a video web portal based on allegations of pirated software use.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1063073.stm">Angola</a> [BBC backgrounder] should <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/12/angola-oil-wealth-eludes-nation-s-poor">take a stronger stand against corruption</a> [press release], according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola-0">report</a> [materials] released Tuesday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. Despite the nation&#39;s large economic growth and increased stability following the end of the nation-wide civil war in 2002, the majority of its citizens&#39; lives fail to reflect the improvements, according to the report. HRW suggests that while some limited measures to fight pervasive corruption have been taken since the release of their <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2004/01/12/some-transparency-no-accountability">2004 report</a> [text], which documented the disappearance of billions of dollars of oil revenue from the central bank, little headway has been made. Following the economic downturn and the subsequent drop in oil prices, Angola entered a financial agreement with the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website]. HRW has called on the IMF and its board members, namely the US and China, to ensure that Angola adhere to the provisions set forth by the IMF, and more specifically that it comply with the call to publicly audit the state oil company <a href="http://www.sonangol.co.ao/wps/portal/ep">Sonangol</a> [official website, Portuguese] and provide frequent updates on the nation&#39;s expenditures.<br /><br />In January, Angola approved a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/angola-adopts-new-constitution.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report] that will end the popular election of the president. The new constitution replaces an <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/CAFRAD/UNPAN002502.pdf">interim constitution</a> [text, PDF] that had been in place since 1975. It provides for the appointment of the country&#39;s president by parliament&#39;s majority party, ending the direct election of the country&#39;s president. It also replaces the position of prime minister with a vice president appointed by the president, and limits the president to two five-year terms. Opponents of the constitution argue that it is merely a way to expand the power of current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1506759.stm">President Jose Eduardo dos Santos</a> [BBC profile], who has been in power since 1979. Members of the ruling party say that it will allow him to <a href="http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2010/0/3/MPLA-hails-approval-Constitution,85893a98-a945-4546-84df-f9dd0370f67a.html">rule the country more effectively</a> [ANGOP report].

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/">Nebraska Legislature</a> [official website] voted 40-9 Monday to approve a bill requiring a heightened level of informed consent and physician assessment of women seeking <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB594.pdf">bill</a> [LB 594 text, PDF] would require health care professionals to determine if the woman seeking the abortion had been pressured into the procedure and would also require them to assess the woman for additional risk factors that could lead to mental or physical complications. Physicians would be responsible for assessing any risk factor mentioned in any research article appearing in peer-reviewed journals one year prior to the procedure, and failure to adequately assess a patient would expose the physician to civil charges. According to the bill, factors to be assessed include &quot;physical, psychological, emotional, demographic, or situational&quot; factors. Critics of the bill <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jzt25qOzuNhJIoNy9bemLPOo8cHQD9F1M9R00">claim it is too vague</a> [AP report] and that it would be difficult for physicians to know all the risk factors for which they are responsible. Proponents of the bill state that the type of patient assessment required by the bill for abortions is in line with the assessments required for other medical procedures. Nebraska <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/">Governor Dave Heineman</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill into law Tuesday. Also Tuesday, the Nebraska legislature is expected to vote on a <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/Current/PDF/Intro/LB1103.pdf">second bill</a> [LB 1103 text, PDF] that would ban abortions after the twentieth week and would narrow the circumstances under which exceptions to the law would be allowed.<br /><br />If the Nebraska bills become law, they would join recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">anti-abortion laws in Oklahoma</a> [JURIST report], which advocacy groups have <a href="/hotline/#5939865606985017885">criticized</a> [JURIST comment] and promised to challenge in court. The possibility of the Supreme Court hearing a case challenging these laws could have an impact on the confirmation hearings of President Obama&#39;s nominee to replace <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/justice-stevens-to-retire-from-us.php">retiring Justice John Paul Stevens</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/April/10-crt-400.html">ordered</a> [DOJ press release] a southern Mississippi school district to end its practice of allowing students to transfer from their assigned schools and classroom groupings, resulting in a segregated school system. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] initially brought a lawsuit to enforce a 1970 order against the <a href="http://www.wcsd.k12.ms.us/">Walthall County School District</a> [official website] that prohibited the district from racially segregating its schools. According to court filings, schools in the district had allowed about 300 students each year, a majority of them white, to transfer to a single school outside of their assigned area, leaving other schools in the district with a disproportionate number of black students. Additionally, some schools had assembled classrooms along racial lines. Judge Tom Lee&#39;s order requires the school district to change its transfer policy to allow a transfer only where the student has provided a compelling justification for the transfer and to revise its classroom assignment protocols. Lee&#39;s order stipulated that the school district must use a software program that randomly allocates students to classrooms to avoid segregation. School officials did not file any opposition in the case and have agreed to follow the judge&#39;s order.<br /><br />Previously, the Walthall County School District had <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/13/AR2010041302867.html">allowed</a> [WP report] white students to transfer from schools located in Tylertown and attend the Salem Attendance Center about 10 miles away. The Tylertown schools host around 1,700 students with a makeup of about 75 percent African American students. More than 550 students go to the Salem Attendance Center, and approximately 66 percent of those students are white. The US Supreme Court originally struck down school segregation in the 1954 case of <a href="http://www.tourolaw.edu/patch/Brown/">Brown v. Board of Education</a> [opinion text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] International rights organizations voiced concern Tuesday about a <a href="http://www.fijilive.com/archive/showpdf.php?pdf=2010/04/DRAFT%20COPYMedia%20Industry%20Development%20Decree%202010.pdf">draft media law</a> [text, PDF] the Fijian government is slated to approve in the near future. The Media Industry Development Decree 2010 includes several provisions that could result in the imprisonment of journalists for up to five years and stiff fines. Pacific Researcher for <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] Apolosi Bose <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/proposed-fiji-media-law-threatens-journalists-jail-2010-04-13">criticized the legislation</a> [press release], saying, &quot;[t]he Fijian government is giving itself a license to imprison or bankrupt its critics. The decree will further restrain the media from reporting government and military abuses, for fear of reprisals through a kangaroo court.&quot; <a href="http://www.ifex.org/">International Federation of Journalists</a> [advocacy website] General Secretary Aidan White <a href="http://www.ifex.org/fiji/2010/04/08/media_decree/">said</a> [press release] last week:<br /><blockquote><br />It is not surprising that Fiji&#39;s regime says it will drop its emergency regulations once the media decree is adopted. The decree is clearly focused on the regime retaining control and entrenching its highly oppressive restrictions, not only on the media but on members of the public who might wish to express dissenting views.<br /></blockquote><br />Of particular concern is provision 21, which bars content that &quot;(a) is against the public interest or order; (b) is against national interest; (c) offends against good taste or decency; or (d) creates communal discord,&quot; and provisions 25 and 26, which penalize media representatives who fail to provide documentation or information requested or refuse searches and seizures for which law enforcement authorities have obtained a warrant. Failure to adhere to provisions could result in fines of up $500,000 for a mass media institutions, and fines of up to $100,000 for editors, publishers, and journalists and up to fives years imprisonment. The tribunal overseeing implementation of the Media Industry Development Decree will be led by a presidential appointee, casting doubt on that entity&#39;s independence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Zimbabwe&#39;s government on Wednesday declared void a law mandating that indigenous people have majority ownership in all businesses valued at over $500,000. The law <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/zimbabwe-law-restricting-foreign.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] last month, but the country&#39;s stock market has since <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8619492.stm">fallen 10 percent</a> [BBC report], causing concern that the law would drive away potential investors. The majority of firms within Zimbabwe that meet the $500,000 threshold are banks and mining companies, and shares in mining companies have fallen 20 percent since the law&#39;s enactment. The decrease in stock value is another obstacle for a country in dire economic straits, including an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe">inflation rate</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] that has been as high as 231,000,000 percent. A spokesperson for <a href="http://www.zimbabweprimeminister.org/">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [official website] indicated that the law, while void, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/04/2010413201213607915.html">will be reexamined</a> [Al Jazeera report] as the government looks for the best way forward.<br /><br />Critics of the law have compared it to the land reform program passed under the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3017678.stm">Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mugabe">news archive</a>] administration in 2000, which resulted in the government <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2063202.stm">seizure of farm land</a> [BBC report] from white farmers. In March, white farmers displaced by Zimbabwe&#39;s land reform program announced an <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/7386395/Zimbabwes-white-farmers-plan-to-seize-government-property.html">intention to seize</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report] Zimbabwean government property in South Africa pursuant to the judgment of the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/tribunal/">Southern African Development Community Tribunal</a> (SADC Tribunal) [official website]. In January, the Zimbabwe High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/zimbabwe-high-court-refuses-to-register.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that it is not bound by a decision of the SADC Tribunal that ordered the state to halt the land reform program for its discriminatory nature. Mugabe has faced <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/21/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum">harsh criticism</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] for the program, which has sought to redistribute white-owned land among the nation&#39;s indigenous farmers. In February 2006, the Zimbabwean land minister said that there are <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">no white farmers operating legally</a> [JURIST report] in Zimbabwe. The government has appropriated some 4,000 farms through the program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://government.moscow.ru/en/capital_russia/judicial_authority/city_moscow_court/">Moscow City Court</a> [official website] judge known for presiding over cases involving neo-Nazi groups was killed Monday morning while leaving his apartment. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8614859.stm">murder</a> [BBC report] of Judge Eduard Chuvashov is suspected to be a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/04/2010412114442810594.html">contract killing</a> [Al Jazeera report] in light of the death threats he faced after presiding over the trials of members of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6977086.stm">neo-Nazi gangs</a> [BBC report]. Last week, Chuvashov <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/world/europe/13moscow.html">sentenced</a> [NYT report] members of the Ryno Gang, a group known for attacking non-Russian immigrants, to 10-20 years in prison for the racially motivated killings of Central Asian immigrants between 2006 and 2007. In February, Chuvashov sentenced members of another ultra-nationalist organization, calling themselves the White Wolves, for committing similar crimes. On Monday, Chuvashov was set to <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/04/12/russia.judge.killed/">begin the trial</a> [CNN report] of a former police officer accused of plotting to bomb national monuments in Moscow. <br /><br />In August 2008, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [official website] called on Russia to take action against growing instances of <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/un-panel-urges-russia-to-comply-with.php">ethnic violence and neo-Nazi activity</a> [JURIST report] within its borders. CERD said that Chechens, Roma, and other ethnic and religious minorities are the most common victims, and noted allegations that Russian police frequently refuse to intervene to stop such attacks. A January 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/russia-hate-crimes-up-13-percent-in.php">report</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] rights group found that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hate+crime">hate crimes</a> [JURIST news archive] in Russia rose 13 percent in 2007, but also found that police have done little to stop attacks. In June 2007, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] reported that hate crimes are on the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/hate-crimes-on-rise-in-europe-rights.php">rise throughout all of Europe</a> [JURIST report], after conducting a study examining recent hate crimes in France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. That study found that Russia has a &quot;proliferation of violent hate crimes directed against ethnic, religious and national minorities.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Council of Europe <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Commissioner on Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile] on Thursday criticized an agreement reached Wednesday between Germany and Kosovo that would return to Kosovo thousands of refugees who fled to Germany during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo War</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo+war">news archive</a>]. The agreement calls for Germany to <a href="http://www.expatica.com/de/news/german-rss-news/germany,-kosovo-agree-to-return-14,000-refugees_37038.html">repatriate up to 2,500 refugees per year</a> [AFP report] and ensures that refugees from all ethnic groups will face repatriation, rather than only <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma</a> [JURIST news archive], who may face persecution in Kosovo. Hammarberg worried that Kosovo does <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5469539,00.html">not yet have the infrastructure</a> [DW report] to care for the returning refugees or to protect them from ethnically motivated violence.<br /><br />Kosovo is currently struggling to be recognized as an independent nation. In December, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icj-begins-advisory-prcoeedings-on.php">began oral arguments</a> regarding an advisory opinion requested by Serbia on the effectiveness of Kosovo&#39;s 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">declaration of independence</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, in an effort to further the legitimacy of their independence, Kosovo began operations of its own judicial system. In March 2009, more than 100 Serbian judges, prosecutors, and legal professionals <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/first-eu-kosovo-trial-blocked-by.php">prevented the opening</a> [JURIST report] of the first EU-backed trial in Kosovo by protesting in front of the Mitrovica court house. A panel of three judges had been set to preside over a criminal case involving two Serbian defendants. As Serbia and Kosovo&#39;s Serbian population have refused to accept Kosovo&#39;s independence, the demonstration was <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=03&dd=02&nav_id=57524">intended to bar the EU from holding trial</a> [B92 report] in Kosovo except under UN laws. The trial court was established by <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website], an EU mission designed to guide Kosovo toward independence in accordance with the Rule of Law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday ordered the release of a 91-page <a href="http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/pdf/blagoproffer.pdf">government proffer</a> [text, PDF] outlining evidence in the government&#39;s case against former Illinois governor <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Blagojevich">Rod Blagojevich</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to the proffer, Blagojevich and his staff <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/blagojevich/2158886,blagojevich-prosecutors-documents-041410.article">engaged in several schemes</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Sun-Times</span> report] by which they hoped to personally gain from Blagojevich&#39;s role as governor. Specifically, prosecutors describe how Blagojevich tried to sell the senate seat vacated by Barack Obama, made appointments based on anticipated campaign contributions, and took kickbacks from a number of companies. The prosecution argues in the proffer that the evidence presented in the proffer is admissible in court against the former governor. The document was sought by several news organizations.<br /><br />Last month, Blagojevich <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blagojevich-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-prosecutors-bring-new-charges.php">eight amended corruption charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, Blagojevich <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/blagojevich-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich.php">16 felony counts</a> [JURIST reports], including wire fraud, attempted extortion, racketeering conspiracy, extortion conspiracy, and making false statements. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich is the first Illinois governor to be impeached and removed from office. Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on allegations that they had conspired to sell the Senate seat left vacant by Obama.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.senate.gov.pk/">Senate</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously passed a  <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/govt_bills/govt_bill2010/constitution_eighteenth_amendment_act2010_060410.pdf">constitutional amendment</a> [text, PDF] that would curtail the powers of the president.  The 18th Amendment Bill would reverse the expansion of presidential powers under former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>] by transferring presidential powers to the <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Cabinet/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNDE_1wkA6zeAMcwNFA388jPzdVvyA7rxwAicV1Mg%21%21/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwODdTNTAyRUlOMzQxTTEwOTQ%21/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/CabDivCL/division/secretary/prime+minister">office of the prime minister</a> [official website], effectively reserving the presidency as a figurehead. Among other changes, the president would no longer have the power to dissolve parliament, dismiss the prime minister, or appoint the chief of the armed forces. Because Pakistan&#39;s lower house, the National Assembly, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-assembly-approves-bill-to-curb.php">unanimously passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill last week, the amendment will now go to <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] to be signed into law.<br /><br />The introduction of the bill comes amid controversy over reopening corruption investigations against Zardari. Earlier this month, Pakistan&#39;s Attorney General Anwar Mansoor <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-ag-resigns-amid-corruption.php">announced his resignation</a> over controversy surrounding a Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">order to investigate corruption allegations</a> [JURIST reports] against Zardari. Last month, Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zardari. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf. The amnesty was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by Musharraf as part of a power-sharing accord allowing former Pakistani prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC profile] to return to the country despite <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/former-pakistan-pm-bhutto-facing.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] she had faced.

After hearing arguments from several same-sex couples who had been denied marriage licenses, courts in Trento and Venice <a href="http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/cronaca/2010/14-aprile-2010/matrimoni-gay-divieto-codice-respinti-ricorsi-venezia-trento--1602834059773.shtml">asked the high court to resolve</a> [<em>Corriere del Veneto</em> report, in Italian] whether provisions in the <a href="http://www.jus.unitn.it/cardozo/Obiter_dictum/codciv/Codciv.htm">Italian Civil Code</a> [text, in Italian] banning same-sex marriage conflict with Articles 2 and 117 of the <a href="http://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf">Italian Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Following a closed session Wednesday morning, the court issued a brief statement declaring the question ineligible with regard to Articles 2 and 117 and unfounded with relation to Articles 3 and 29. The court is expected to issue a detailed judgment soon.<br /><br />In 2007, Italy&#39;s Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/italy-cabinet-approves-same-sex-rights.php">approved a controversial proposal</a> [JURIST report] to grant a number of legal rights to unmarried couples, including those of the same sex. The proposal, harshly criticized by the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italy-justice-minister-opposes.php">justice minister</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/top-italian-bishop-denounces-same-sex.php">bishop</a> [JURIST reports], ultimately failed. Italy is one of few Western European nations that does not offer legal recognition to same-sex couples. Most recently, the Portugese Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/portugal-lawmakers-give-preliminary.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in January. Prior to that, the Swedish Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">enacted similar legislation</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia filed <a href="/pdf/chiquitacomplaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday against <a href="http://www.chiquitabrands.com/">Chiquita Brand International</a> [corporate website], which has admitted to funding a right-wing paramilitary group in Colombia. In the complaint filed in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website], 242 Colombians alleged that they had been seriously injured or had family members killed by the <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/auc.cfm">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CDI backgrounder]. The AUC has been accused of mass killings during the Colombia guerrilla warfare movement before disarmament in 2003. The plaintiffs, who are seeking over $1 billion in damages, brought suit under a 1992 law that allows US citizens to sue for terrorist acts committed by US firms abroad. The complaint alleges that Chiquita aided and abetted in the murders and provided material support and resources to terrorists.<br /><br />In February, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-allows-suit-against.php">federal judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit accusing Chiquita of assisting Marxist rebels who killed Colombian missionaries may go forward. The suit was <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/judge-rules-families-can-proceed-with-suit-against-214454.html">brought</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Palm Beach Post</span> report] by family members of five North American missionaries who had worked for the <a href="http://www.ntm.org/">New Tribes Mission</a> (NTM) [mission website] in South America and were killed in separate incidents between 1995 and 1996. Chiquita admitted it had paid AUC for protection of its workers but it argued that it did not condone the killings. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after it admitted to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to AUC. Following that admission, hundreds of family members of Colombians killed by FARC filed lawsuits in the US against Chiquita under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1350.notes.html">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> (ATCA) [text]. In January, Chiquita <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ayT65YLVeJBs">settled</a> [Bloomberg report] a shareholder lawsuit over the illegal payments.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Arizona House <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/press/House/49leg/2R/4_13_10+NEWS+RELEASE+IMMIGRATION+SB1070.DOC.htm">approved</a> [press release] a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">bill</a> [SB 1070 materials] Tuesday that would establish one of the strictest <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] policies in the nation. The bill would criminalize being in the US without proper documentation and would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/15immig.html">give law enforcement officers increased ability</a> [NYT report] to require individuals suspected of being illegal immigrants to provide proof of their legal status. The proposal has been heavily criticized by immigrant rights groups. Chris Newman, Legal Director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network <a href="http://www.ndlon.org/index.php?view=article&catid=59%3Apress-releases&id=300%3Andlon-responds-to-the-passage-of-arizona-sb1070&option=com_content&Itemid=83">condemned the bill</a> [press release] as &quot;the most anti-immigrant legislation the country has seen in a generation.&quot; The bill now moves to the Senate, where it is expected to be approved and sent to Governor Jan Brewer, who will likely approve the final version.  <br /><br />In 2008, Arizona voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/immigration-ballot-measures-defeated-in.php">defeated a ballot measure</a> [JURIST report] dealing with illegal immigrants. The initiative would have revoked the business licenses of employers that knowingly hire illegal immigrants and would have strengthened penalties for identity theft. More illegal immigrants enter the US through Arizona&#39;s border than through any other state, and citizens have expressed frustration with the federal government&#39;s failure to prevent illegal immigration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An independent UN commission has blamed the Pakistani government and police forces for the 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassination</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">former prime minister Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>] in its <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Pakistan/UN_Bhutto_Report_15April2010.pdf">investigatory report</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday. According to the report, the Pakistani federal government &quot;lacked a comprehensive security plan&quot; and failed to provide adequate security for Bhutto by relying on local officials without giving them &quot;necessary instructions.&quot; In the report, the commission accused the government of failing to launch a proper investigation into those responsible for the attack. The report also accused the government of hindering their investigation and called their various failures &quot;deliberate&quot;:<br /><blockquote><br />A range of Government officials failed profoundly in their efforts first to protect Ms. Bhutto and second to investigate with vigour all those responsible for her murder, not only in the execution of the attack, but also in its conception, planning and financing. ... The Commission believes that the failures of the police and other officials to react effectively to Ms. Bhutto&#39;s assassination were, in most cases, deliberate.<br /></blockquote><br />The commission ultimately concluded that Bhutto&#39;s assassination could have been prevented, if not for governmental ignorance. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp">praised</a> [statement] the commission&#39;s work and left the responsibility for any criminal investigation with Pakistani authorities. <br /><br />The three-member commission was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/un-names-bhutto-assassination.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] in June. Members included Chilean Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://www.un.int/chile/Biogr/biomunozengl.htm">Heraldo Munoz</a> [official profile], former attorney general of Indonesia Marzuki Darusman, and Peter Fitzgerald, a former deputy police commissioner in the Irish National Police who has served with the UN in other capacities. Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack in December 2007 that claimed the lives of at least 20 other people. At that time, Bhutto was the head of the opposition <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a>, which was challenging then-prime minister Pervez Musharraf&#39;s <a href="http://pakistanmuslimleague.info/beta/">Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid </a>(PML-Q) [party websites] in the lead-up to parliamentary elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chinese Intermediate People&#39;s Court in Chongqing on Wednesday <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/14/c_13251252.htm">sentenced</a> [Xinhua report] former deputy police chief and high-ranking judicial official Wen Qiang to death. Wen was convicted of accepting bribes, protecting criminal gangs, rape, and being unable to justify his large amount of personal assets. The court&#39;s verdict stated that from 1996 to 2009 Wen accepted 12 million yuan in bribes, or approximately $1.76 million. Wen was also found guilty of protecting five organized crime gangs in Chongqing and raping a university student in 2007. The verdict stated that Wen would be <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-04/14/content_9730337.htm">stripped of his political rights</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report] for life, and his personal property would be confiscated. Wen is the highest-ranking official to be charged in the <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/174696/chinese-official-sentenced-to-death-in-mafia-trial">corruption probe</a> [AFP report] in Chongqing. Wen&#39;s wife, Zhou Xiaoya, was convicted of taking advantage of her husband&#39;s position and accepting bribes of 4.49 million yuan and faces eight years in jail.<br /><br />Wen&#39;s conviction comes amid China&#39;s continuing attempt to eradicate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+corruption">government corruption</a> [JURIST news archive]. In March, the Hebei Province People&#39;s High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld a life sentence</a> for former vice president of China&#39;s Supreme People&#39;s Court (SPC), Huang Songyou, who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, SPC president <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/dfg/index.php?id=119">Wang Shengjun</a> [official profile, in Chinese] called for increased efforts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country&#39;s court system. In January, the SPC announced <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. In October, two Chongqing courts <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/china-courts-sentence-6-to-death-for.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six individuals to death for their connections with organized crime gangs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nine Afghan witnesses have claimed that they were held and tortured in a secret US prison at the <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">news archive</a>] in Afghanistan, according to a BBC report Thursday. The witnesses say that they were allegedly captured by American forces and taken to a secret location where they were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8621973.stm">abused and interrogated</a> [BBC report], then later transported to an official detention facility in Parwan, a new prison <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/obama-adminstration-to-open-new-bagram.php">recently opened</a> [JURIST report] at the edge of Bagram Air Base. Torture allegations include sleep deprivation, disorientation, beating, and humiliation tactics. The report comes a few weeks after US President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123197147">made a surprise visit</a> [press release] to the base in Afghanistan. The new US prison has room for 1,400 detainees, is part of the Obama administration&#39;s wider efforts to improve its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bagram">Afghan detainee system</a> [JURIST news archive], and will eventually be controlled by the Afghan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghanistan-authorities-commit-to.php">later this year</a> [JURIST report]. Rights groups have previously called on the Obama administration to make sure its <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/news/us-must-reform-afghanistan-detention-policy">detention policy conforms to international law</a> [press release]. Despite the <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100215/gopal">alleged witness accounts of torture</a> [The <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span> report], the US government continues to deny the existence of secret prisons in Afghanistan. <br /><br />Alleged prisoner abuse linked to the war on terror in Afghanistan has received international attention. Last week, a retired Canadian military officer who served in Afghanistan said that Canadian soldiers believed that <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/troops-knew-of-afghan-prisoner-abuse-retired-captain-says/article1528370/?cmpid=rss1">prisoners may have been abused</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report] after being transferred to prison facilities in Afghanistan. Human rights groups have also criticized military procedures in the country. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-habeas-petitions-on-behalf.php">filed <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petitions</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of four detainees held at Bagram Air Base, claiming that none of the men has engaged in hostile behavior directed at the US, nor are they members of groups that purport to do so. In January, the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php">released a list of names</a> of 645 prisoners detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU last September. Prisoners at Bagram have launched previous <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-dismisses-afghan-bagram.php">challenges</a> [JURIST report] in US courts but thus far have been less successful than those held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Argentine relatives of Spanish citizens killed during the <a href="http://unx1.shsu.edu/%7Ehis_ncp/SpanCW.html">Spanish Civil War</a> [LOC backgrounder] asked an Argentine <a href="http://www.pjn.gov.ar/">federal court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday to open a judicial investigation into human rights violations committed during the early years of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] regime. The complainants contend that their case, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jTiJGbMm_2oyeSvoY-f3JSfIZXqA">alleging</a> [AFP report] the regime&#39;s responsibility for the execution of their relatives, can be heard in Argentina&#39;s courts through <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>]. They also hope to add to their complaint any other cases involving disappearances or killings committed during Franco&#39;s regime. Local human rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.abuelas.org.ar/">Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo</a>, the <a href="http://www.liga.org.ar/">Argentine League for Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.serpaj.org/">Peace and Justice Service</a> [advocacy websites, in Spanish] have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gZDqXgXBbRbAWjmCiuGWCK5VCezwD9F2S0VG0">joined the complainants</a> [AP report] in support of the investigation. If the Argentine federal court decides to take the case, it will be the first time an Argentine court invokes universal jurisdiction for crimes committed in another country.<br /><br />The request for a judicial probe in Argentina is a reaction to the Spanish Supreme Court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">decision to charge</a> [JURIST report] National Court judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] with abuse of power for his investigation of war crimes during the Franco regime. The indictment has sparked international <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/opinion/09fri2.html">outrage</a> [NYT op-ed] and massive <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/opinion/09fri2.html">protests</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">La Jornada</span> report, in Spanish] in Spain. Last week, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-judge-garzon-appeals-high-court.php">appealed the indictment</a> [JURIST report]. Garzon alleged that the indictment is politically motivated, compromises judicial independence, and seeks to impose a specific interpretation of a 1977 law granting amnesty for political crimes committed under Franco.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/genachowski/">Chairman Julius Genachowski</a> [official profile] <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-297494A1.pdf">testified</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday before the <a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/public/">Senate Commerce Committee</a> [official website] that the agency will move ahead with its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>] despite a recent <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that it lacks the power to enforce <a href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html">net neutrality</a> [Google backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">news archive</a>]. Net neutrality, which is <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">unanimously supported</a> [JURIST report] by the FCC&#39;s commissioners, was thought essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information. Genachowski said that the FCC&#39;s actions, as laid out in the <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/plan/broadband-action-agenda.html">2010 Broadband Action Agenda</a> [materials] will, &quot;protect America&#39;s global competitiveness and help deliver the extraordinary benefits of broadband to all Americans.&quot; The roadmap, he continued, falls within the framework of the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">Communications Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF] as amended in 1996 and will be, &quot;rooted in a sound legal foundation, designed to promote investment, innovation, competition, and consumer interests.&quot; <br /><br />The FCC announced last week that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/fcc-to-pursue-broadband-plan-despite.php">move forward with the plan</a> [JURIST reports] despite the ruling. The FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fcc-presents-broadband-regulation-plan.php">sent the plan</a> [JURIST report] to Congress for approval last month, seeking approval to enact regulations to update the communications infrastructure in the US and make broadband service available to millions more Americans. Telecommunications companies <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="http://www.comcast.com/default.cspx">Comcast</a> [corporate websites] argue that net neutrality would inhibit their ability to effectively manage Internet traffic. Under the National Broadband plan, the FCC hopes to provide broadband access as broadly as possible, including to at least one public institution in every community and to first responders. Other notable goals of the plan include providing 100 million households with affordable 100 megabits-per-second internet service and ensuring that all children are literate in digital technology by the time they leave high school.

AI addressed newly-elected <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website], calling on him to bring Ukrainian laws and practices in line with international human rights standards. Among the recommendations are establishing an investigatory agency to look into complaints of human rights violations against police officers as well as unannounced visits to prisons to deter improper treatment of prisoners. AI also urged Ukraine to record and monitor incidents of racially motivated crimes and to create a fair asylum system. The Ukrainian government responded Thursday that it would <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/ukrainian-authorities-respond-amnesty-internationals-human-rights-challenge-2010-04">follow the recommendations</a> [press release]. Deputy head of Ukraine&#39;s presidential administration Anna German assured AI that the president was in control of &quot;the promotion and unconditional protection of human rights.&quot;<br /><br />Yanukovych was inaugurated in February after former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-challenging.php">dropped a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] contesting the election results, in which she alleged widespread voter fraud.  AI has recently urged other countries to investigate human rights abuses. Last month, AI issued a report alleging that Kazakhstan&#39;s government was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/kazakhstan-failing-to-prevent-torture.php">failing to curb torture</a> [JURIST report] by law enforcement officers. The group also joined other human rights organizations in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-mps-rights-groups-call-for-torture.php">calling for an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the UK role in torture during the war on terror.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Israeli prime minister <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/3/Ehud%20Olmert">Ehud Olmert</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=olmert">news archive</a>] was named a suspect Thursday in an investigation into the Holyland bribery scandal that occurred during his time as mayor of Jerusalem. It is expected that law enforcement will <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3876771,00.html">interrogate</a> [Ynet report] Olmert over the alleged bribery scandal in which top Jerusalem officials are believed to have taken bribes for enabling the construction of a high-rise luxury housing development. Seven former officials have been arrested including former Jerusalem mayor Uri Lupolianski, who was deputy mayor under Olmert. Lupolianski <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3876126,00.html">accused</a> [Ynet report] Olmert of being responsible for the scandal, saying the deputy mayor is nothing more than a mere title with no real authority. Police <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8622268.stm">believe</a> [BBC report] Olmert alone received $940,000 to approve zoning change, rejecting hundreds of objections, to allow for a twelve-fold increase in the number of residential units allowed in the area, enabling the construction of a high-rise complex. Olmert is denying involvement in the scandal.<br /><br />Olmert has been embroiled in accusations of scandal for much of his political career. He is already <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/israel-ex-pm-olmert-pleads-not-guilty.php">facing trial</a> [JURIST report], the first of a former or current Israeli prime minister, for corruption and fraud charges that led to his resignation from being prime minister in 2008. He is accused of illegally <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/prosecutor-alleges-israel-pm-accepted.php">accepting cash contributions</a> from an American businessman, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-attorney-general-considering.php">double billing</a> [JURIST reports] travel expenses to the state and charitable donors, and giving his former law partner access to state information. In April 2007, Olmert was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/israel-official-recommends-criminal.php">investigated for improperly favoring his supporters</a> [JURIST report] in distributing business grants during his time as trade minister. In January 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/israel-pm-facing-criminal.php">announced plans to launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that he promoted the interests of two business associates during the 2005 state sale of <a href="http://english.leumi.co.il/Home/0,2777,1415,00.html">Bank Leumi</a> [corporate website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] said Wednesday that the government has not ruled out prosecuting certain high-profile terror suspects in civilian court in New York City. During a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4470">hearing</a> [materials] on oversight of the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Holder told the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] that the government is still considering trying several high-level terror suspects, including alleged 9/11 conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Admitting that finding a proper venue for civilian trials outside the Southern District of New York could pose difficulties, Holder said he had compiled a list of other possibly appropriate venues. Holder said he has taken safety and logistical concerns under advisement and that the DOJ will be ready to decide where to try the suspects &quot;in a number of weeks.&quot; Holder also reiterated the Obama administration&#39;s goal to close down the detention facility at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] as quickly as possible. He said that the facility could not be closed until funds have been secured to <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-to-house.php">purchase an alternate site in Illinois</a> [JURIST report] to which the remaining detainees will be transferred. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/attorney-general-stands-behind-use-criminal-courts-911-terrorism-suspects">praised the administration</a> [ACLU release] for its insistence on trying the suspects in civilian courts, but criticized Holder for saying the government will continue to hold particularly dangerous detainees without charges.<br /><br />Late last month, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">US Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-appoints-top.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] retired <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=187">Navy Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald</a> [official profile] as the convening authority for <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive], leading to speculation that the Obama administration was planning to try the 9/11 conspirators in a military trial. Last month, Holder <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">defended his decision</a> [JURIST report] to try the suspected terrorists in civilian court. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/attorney-general-holder-defends-decision-try-911-suspects-federal-court">expressed support</a> [press release] for Holder&#39;s decision. Earlier in March, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after reports that White House advisers were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the alleged conspirators would face civilian criminal trials rather than military tribunals late last year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Cabinet of India has approved the <a href="http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/India-Anti-Torture-Bill-2009.pdf">Prevention of Torture Bill</a> [text, PDF] in an effort to move closer to international human rights standards. The bill, which experienced long delays <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Cabinet-clears-anti-torture-bill/articleshow/5776064.cms">before being passed</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] last week, will now be introduced to the <a href="http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/">Indian Parliament</a> [official website]. Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/welcome.asp">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] strongly supports the bill in order to move the country closer to complying with the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/100296.pdf">UN Convention Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text, PDF] by expanding Indian law to define torture, among other things. India remains among the small number of nations that has not ratified the treaty. The bill was introduced more than a year before it was passed. Many Cabinet members feared political backlash, as the public strongly supports actions taken against terrorists. Despite the passing of the bill, human groups <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/india-approves-anti-torture-law/article1533331/">believe</a> [Globe and Mail report] that India still has a long way to go to prevent torture in the country. <br /><br />Last month, an Indian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-court-hears-final-arguments-in.php">heard closing arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the trial of <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammed Ajmal Kasab</a> [NDTV backgrounder], accused of participating in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+terror+attack">news archive</a>]. Kasab claims that he confessed to the crimes in February 2009 after <a href="http://beta.thehindu.com/news/national/article253771.ece?homepage=true">being tortured</a> [<em>Hindu</em> report] by police. In December, Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-withdraws.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] his confession in an Indian court, claiming he was tortured and framed by police. Kasab originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-pleads-not.php">pleaded not guilty</a> in May, but interrupted his trial in July to confess and change his <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-stops.php">plea to guilty</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A German court ruled Thursday that persons from the former East Germany do not constitute a unique ethnic group for discrimination prevention purposes. The matter <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5471294,00.html">arose</a> [DW report] when an East Berlin woman sued a Stuttgart company after the company rejected her employment application and returned her resume with the term &quot;Ossi,&quot; a derogatory term for someone with ties to the former East Germany, written alongside a minus sign. Though admitting the term&#39;s negative connotation, the judge concluded that place of birth alone is <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,689403,00.html">inadequate to qualify</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Spiegel</span> report] as an ethnic group. Additional attributes such as tradition, culture, language, and religion must be considered, and the former East Germany is not sufficiently disparate from West Germany, per the court.<br /><br />Many Germans believe that, though the physical barriers that once divided Germany no longer exist, a &quot;wall in the mind&quot; persists that leads to continued prejudice. A 2008 study concluded that 64 percent of those from the former East Germany believe they are regarded as <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,594656,00.html">&quot;second-class citizens,&quot;</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Spiegel</span> report] while 77 percent believe that those from West Germany receive preferential treatment. The same study revealed that 59 percent of those surveyed feel the country continues to consist of two distinct communities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/"> American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] on Wednesday called on the <a href="www.doc.state.al.us">Alabama Department of Corrections</a> (ADOC) [official website] to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/sentenced-stigma-segregation-hiv-positive-prisoners-alabama-and-south-carolina">end prison segregation based on HIV status</a> [press release]. The ACLU and HRW jointly produced a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Report Sentenced to Stigma Segregation of HIV-Positive Prisoners in Alabama and South Carolina.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], which concluded that the prisoners face fundamental discrimination which amounts to &quot;cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners,&quot; including:<br /><blockquote><br />involuntary disclosure of HIV status to family, staff and other prisoners; loss of liberty by assignment to higher security prisons; denial of work, program and re-entry opportunities; and policies that promote, rather than combat, fear, prejudice and even violence against persons living with HIV. These and other conditions documented in this report go well beyond discrimination. <br /></blockquote><br />ADOC <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama Prison Commissioner Richard Allen%27s letter ACLU.pdf">responded</a> [report, PDF] by saying that the policy is necessary for the safety and protection of the inmates and guards and has resulted  in a &quot;near zero&quot; rate of new HIV infections within the Alabama prison system since 2005. HIV-positive inmates are restricted in receiving rehabilitative programs such as in-prison jobs, education, faith-based or honor dorms, and reentry programs. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report.html">claims</a> [report] that prison rape is systemic, prevalent, and under-reported, and that there is no evidence that segregating prisoners with HIV reduces the transmission of HIV within prisons. <br /><br />Alabama is currently the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/13/alabama-and-south-carolina-stop-segregating-hiv-positive-prisoners">only state</a> [HRW press release] that keeps a strict quarantine on HIV-positive inmates. South Carolina has a similar policy for housing but allows commingling for activities. In March, Mississippi <a href="http://picayuneitem.com/local/x1112099492/MDOC-to-end-segregation-of-HIV-inmates">ended</a> [AP report] its segregation program, after <a href="http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/mississippi-prisons-end-segregation-based-hiv-aclu-hails-breakthrough-vows-continue">extending</a> [ACLU press release] educational and vocational training to HIV-positive inmates in 2001. In 1990, the ACLU, on behalf of HIV-positive prisoners, sued to force Mississippi to provide proper medical care. HRW has also accused the federal <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] of providing <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/dhs-immigration-detention-care-for-hiv.php">inadequate medical care</a> [JURIST report] to HIV-positive immigration detainees.

Committee members were angered by the FBI&#39;s use of &quot;exigent letters,&quot; which lack any statutory authority, as a means by which to circumvent proper NSL protocol. Their appearance follows the January release of a DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s1001r.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] that documented hundreds of instances of FBI officials employing the tactic to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/fbi-illegally-collected-phone-records.php">improperly gain access to personal records</a> [JURIST report]. House Judiciary Chair <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official website] <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/100414.html">condemned</a> [press release] the practice, saying:<br /><blockquote><br />Today&#39;s hearing showed that the FBI broke the law on telephone records privacy and the General Counsel&#39;s Office, headed by Valerie Caproni, sanctioned it and must face consequences. I call upon FBI Director Mueller to take immediate action to punish those who violated the rules, including firing them from the agency. This must include the FBI Office of General Counsel, headed by Valerie Caproni, which the IG testified today had &quot;approved [the] continued use&quot; of exigent letters and &quot;provided legal advice that was inconsistent with&quot; federal law.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/fbi-testifies-house-national-security-letters">expressed similar disappointment</a> [press release] for what it called &quot;blatant and systematic abuse,&quot; and pushed for swift reform.<br /><br />Fine previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] in September that the FBI had <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/09-09-23%20Fine%20Testimony.pdf">significantly understated</a> [statement, PDF] the number of NSL requests from 2003 to 2006. Fine noted that FBI officials had &quot;devoted significant time, energy, and resources to correcting its errors,&quot; but that it was &quot;too early to definitively state whether the FBI&#39;s efforts have eliminated the problems.&quot; The FBI began the practice of allowing supervisors to authorize collection of phone records on the basis of emergency situations shortly after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Patriot+Act">Patriot Act</a> [JURIST news archive] was passed in October 2001.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Nova Scotian government <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/news/smr/2010-04-15-pardon.asp">officially pardoned</a> [ceremony materials] and issued an apology to Canadian civil rights icon Viola Desmond in a ceremony Thursday attended by <a href="http://www.gov.ns.ca/premier/about/">Premier Darrell Dexter</a> and <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/legislature/members/cabinet/landry.html">Minister of Justice Landry Ross</a> [official profiles]. Desmond, an African-Canadian woman who died in 1965, was fined $20 and jailed overnight in 1946 on charges that stemmed from her refusal to leave an area of a theater reserved for white patrons. Dexter <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/nova-scotia/story/2010/04/15/ns-desmond-apology-dexter.html">apologized</a> [CBC report] to Desmond&#39;s family, including her sister Wanda Robson who was at the ceremony, and all African Nova Scotians for the government&#39;s actions against Desmond. Dexter stated:<br /><blockquote><br />The arrest, detainment and conviction of Viola Desmond is an example in our history where the law was used to perpetuate racism and racial segregation - this is contrary to the values of Canadian society. We recognize today that the act for which Viola Desmond was arrested, was an act of courage, not an offence.<br /></blockquote><br />Robson said her parents would be proud to know that Desmond had become a Canadian hero and urged people to learn from the incident to prevent similar situations. This marked the first posthumous &quot;free pardon&quot; in Canadian history, recognizing that Desmond was innocent and her conviction was in error.<br /><br />Last year, Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Barry Langford <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/birmingham-mayor-pardons-civil-rights.php">pardoned about 2,500 people</a> [JURIST report] arrested for non-violent civil rights protests in the city during the 1960&#39;s. In April 2006, <a href="http://www.governor.state.al.us/">Alabama Governor Bob Riley</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/alabama-governor-signs-law-to-pardon.php">authorized pardons</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/heroes/profile/parks01.html">Rosa Parks</a> [TIME profile], the <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/DrMLKingJr/">Rev.

Parks helped trigger the civil rights movement across the US after she was arrested in Montgomery, AL, in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. Parks <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/civil-rights-activist-rosa-parks-dies.php">died in 2005</a> [JURIST report] at the age of 92.

Some of the documents reveal an e-mail in which Rodriguez said that &quot;the heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into the public domain ... they would make us look terrible; it would be devastating to us.&quot; The documents were released as part of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website]. Ben Wizner, senior staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project said that the &quot;documents provide further evidence that senior CIA officials were willing to risk being prosecuted for obstruction of justice in order to avoid being prosecuted for torture. If the Department of Justice fails to hold these officials accountable, they will have succeeded in their cover-up.&quot;<br /><br />Last year, it was revealed that 12 of the 92 videotapes destroyed by the CIA <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/destroyed-cia-interrogation-tapes.php">contained evidence</a> [JURIST report] of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot;  The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had previously acknowledged that the CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 videotapes, in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information.

On Thursday, the de-facto government of Palestinian <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaza">Gaza</a> [JURIST news archive] executed Naser Abu Furaih and Mohamed al-Sabaa, both of whom were convicted of treason last February in connection with the Israeli occupation of Gaza. Pillay, who said that she was &quot;alarmed&quot; by reports that Hamas planned to execute several more prisoners soon, called on the Islamist authority to abolish the use of the death penalty:<br /><blockquote><br />It is extremely disappointing that Hamas is contemplating a return to the use of the death penalty, despite the fact that no officially-sanctioned death sentences have been carried out in Gaza since 2005. ... I call on Hamas to reconsider its position and exhibit respect for the international community&#39;s firm rejection of the death penalty ... and to fully uphold and promote the right to life.<br /></blockquote><br />Human rights groups have also denounced the executions. On Thursday, Israeli human rights organization <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B&#39;Tselem</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Press_Releases/20100415.asp">condemned Hamas</a> [press release], saying that the prisoners&#39; trial &quot;did not meet even minimal standards of due process.&quot; Also Thursday, the <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/">Palestinian Center for Human Rights</a> (PCHR) [advocacy website] said that any execution conducted without the ratification of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1933453.stm">Mahmoud Abbas</a> [BBC profile], the president of the secular <a href="http://imeu.net/news/article0047.shtml">Palestinian National Authority</a> (PNA) [IMEU backgrounder], was <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/portal/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6434:pchr-strongly-condemns-execution-of-two-prisoners-by-gaza-government-&catid=36:pchrpressreleases&Itemid=194">unconstitutional</a> [press release].<br /><br />Hamas has recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/israel-hamas-failed-to-conduct-credible.php">fallen under fire</a> [JURIST report] from human rights groups recently for its failure to conduct an independent investigation into accusations of war crimes during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm">January 2009 Gaza conflict</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Sunday convicted 57 members of the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] on charges relating to their involvement in last year&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7912112.stm">border guard mutiny</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bangladesh+mutiny">news archive</a>]. BDR Special Court-3 in the southeast district of Feni <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=134886">sentenced</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report] those convicted to jail terms ranging from four months to seven years, and fined each BDT $100 (USD $1.45) for taking up arms and blocking a road during the 33-hour mutiny. Only five were acquitted. Civilian courts will <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8628368.stm">hear more serious charges</a> [BBC report] related to the mutiny, such as murder, arson, and rape, and may impose the death penalty on those found guilty. The sentences <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/04/18/world/AP-AS-Bangladesh-Mutiny-Trial.html">comprise the third</a> [AP report] of dozens of cases against the several thousand alleged mutiny participants who are being tried throughout Bangladesh, and come two weeks after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/bangladesh-court-convicts-29-over.php">sentencing of 29 BDR members</a> [JURIST report] on similar charges.<br /><br />The six Special Courts were <a href="http://priyo.com/news/2009/sep/16/30539.html">established</a> [Priyo report] shortly after the Bangladeshi <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/bangladesh-high-court-recommends.php">recommended against</a> [JURIST report] military court-martial trials for BDR members who took part in the mutiny. Dozens of BDR officers, including the force&#39;s commander, were killed and their bodies left in sewers and shallow graves during the mutiny, which was sparked by grievances over pay and conditions. <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=135&Itemid=208">President Zillur Rahman</a> [official profile] asked for the court&#39;s opinion to determine whether the accused should be tried under the <a href="http://www.bdlaws.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?act_name=&vol=&id=248">Army Act of 1952</a> [text] or whether they should face civilian trials. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [BBC profile] initially offered the mutineers amnesty as part of a deal negotiated to end the uprising, but the agreement was rescinded when the conduct of the mutineers was fully revealed.

According to the state-run <a href="http://www.irna.ir/">Islamic Republic News Agency</a> (IRNA) [official website, in Persian], Mohsen Mirdamadi, Mostafa Tajzadeh, and Davood Soleimani were convicted of spreading propaganda against the government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Regensburg District Court in southern Germany convicted British Bishop Richard Williamson of incitement on Friday for denying the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Holocaust">Holocaust</a> [JURIST news archive] and ordered him to pay a 10,000 euro fine. The case stemmed from an interview to Swedish TV channel SVT1, broadcast in January 2009,in which Williamson said he <a href="http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2010-04/williamson-holocaust-urteil">doubted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Die Zeit</span> report, in German] that six million Jews were killed in gas chambers. Last year, the same court issued a 12,000 euro fine against Williamson in connection with this case, but Williamson contested the decision, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100416/ap_on_re_eu/eu_germany_holocaust_denial">forcing the public trial</a> [AP report]. When Williamson gave the interview to the Swedish TV channel he asked the crew not to broadcast the interview in Germany, because denial of the Holocaust is a criminal offense there. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/europe/25pope.html">lifting of Williamson&#39;s excommunication</a> [NYT report] last year by <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/index.htm">Pope Benedict XVI</a> [Vatican profile] caused international outrage. <br /><br />In February, the <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">Hungarian Parliament</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/hungary-parliament-passes-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits denials of the Holocaust. In November, the German <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-constitutional-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] legislation prohibiting public support and justification of the Nazi regime. In 2007, the European Union <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/eu-approves-framework-decision.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a framework aimed at criminalizing denial of the Holocaust and other genocides after six years of contentious debate. Also in 2007, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/german-court-sentences-zundel-to-5.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] anti-Semitic writer <a href="http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/zundel.asp?xpicked=2&item=zundel">Ernst Zundel</a> [ADL profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zundel">news archive</a>] to five years in prison after finding him guilty on 14 counts of incitement, libel and disparaging the dead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Hundreds of Sunni men were detained without warrant and subjected to torture under authority of the military office of Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official profile, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">profile</a>], according to a Monday <em>Los Angeles Times</em> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/africa/la-fg-iraq-prison19-2010apr19,0,4657710.story">report</a> [text]. More than 400 men were initially detained in October during sweeps of Nineveh province, an area in which <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/al-qaeda_in_iraq.htm">al Qaeda in Iraq</a> (AQI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] was active, and transferred to a Baghdad prison due to concerns over corruption in the provincial capitol of Mosul. According to Nineveh Governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, many of the men were not members of AQI and were detained without a warrant. Maliki maintains that the conditions of the prison were first revealed to him earlier this month, after Iraqi Human Rights Minister Wijdan Salim was allowed to inspect the facility. Salim&#39;s inspection teams found that all of the men had been kept in poor conditions and more than 100 of men had been subject to torture, including a former colonel under <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], who died in January as a result. Since the inspections, 75 of the men have been freed and 275 have been transferred to other prisons. Maliki said that he <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/04/18/Sunnis-said-tortured-in-secret-Iraq-prison/UPI-32191271646614/">plans to close</a> [UPI report] the prison and arrest the officers responsible for the mistreatment of prisoners. News of the secret prison comes at a sensitive time for Maliki as he tries to build a government following the March <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/special/misc/iraqielections2010/">parliamentary election</a> [CEIP backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">news archive</a>], in which his Shiite dominated <a href="http://qanoon337.org/en/">State of Law</a> [official website] coalition <a href="http://www.themajlis.org/projects/iraq-results">came in a close second</a> [Majlis report] to the cross-sectarian Iraqiya headed by former-prime minister <a href="http://www.ayadallawi.com/">Iyad Allawi</a> [official website, in Arabic; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/2010329495420860.html">profile</a>].<br /><br />Maliki <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-pm-creates-prison-abuse.php">created a special committee</a> [JURIST report] in June to investigate alleged abuse and torture in the country&#39;s prisons. Comprised of eight members, the committee includes representatives from human rights and judicial government agencies and security ministries. The decision to create the panel came shortly after <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-authorities-charging-police.php">charges were brought</a> [JURIST report] against 43 Iraqi police officers for human rights abuses, warrantless arrests, and bribery allegations. The violations were discovered by an investigatory committee formed by Iraqi <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bolani">Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani</a> [JURIST news archive]. Loyalists to Shiite cleric <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/7637/">Muqtada al-Sadr</a> [CFR profile] have pressured the Iraqi government over prison conditions that they claim include confessions elicited from torture and politically motivated false accusations. In August 2008, officials for Iraq&#39;s Human Rights Ministry said that they plan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iraq-planning-to-prosecute-prison.php">prosecute those suspected of torturing inmates</a> [JURIST report] of the country&#39;s prison system. In November 2005, US troops <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/iraqi-officials-to-investigate.php">found 173 prisoners</a> [JURIST report], many abused, in a secret bunker run by the Interior Ministry. Earlier that year, then-UN secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Kofi Annan</a> [official profile] said that Iraq&#39;s detention practices may violate international law and <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/annan-iraq-detention-practices-may.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the failure of Coalition forces to publish the results of their investigation into the torture allegations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] on Thursday ordered <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/ahmad_wais_afzali/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Imam Ahmad Afzali</a> [NYT profile] to leave the country within 90 days. Afzali <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-cleric-pleads-guilty-to-lying-to-fbi.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to lying to FBI agents in connection with the investigation of a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system. Judge Frederic Block ordered electronic surveillance of Afzali until he leaves the country. Afzali will serve no prison sentence for the crime, but will be deported to Afghanistan if he does not comply with the order to leave the country voluntarily.<br /><br />Afzali&#39;s case stems from his role as a police informant in an investigation of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=" edu="" q="zazi"">Najibullah Zazi</a> [JURIST news archive], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-terrorism-suspect-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in February to terrorism charges for planning the subway attacks. Afzali has admitted to telling Zazi that the FBI was investigating him, but later denying the fact to the FBI. Also in February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-announces-indictment-of-suspected.php">announced superseding indictments</a> [JURIST report] against Adis Mendunjanin and Zaerein Ahmedzay, two other men accused of planning to bomb subways in New York City. Mendunjanin previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-terrorism-suspect-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to similar charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kyrgyzstan interim government announced Sunday that it will place ousted president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile] on trial for killings that took place during the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">recent uprising</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month and for abuse of power while in office. The interim government is also <a href="http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/asia/Kyrgyzstans-Interim-Government-Plans-to-Put-on-Trial-Deposed-President-91236624.html">planning to try</a> [VOA report] members of Bakiyev&#39;s family and administration on charges that include corruption and human rights violations. Despite the pledge to bring Bakiyev and his allies to justice, so far only Baktybek Kaliyev, Bakiyev&#39;s defense minister, has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl9bo4DfKFLUi5Ciy_d6bAOU8Vdg">arrested</a> [AFP report]. It is believed that Bakiyev is currently in Kazakhstan, and interim officials have said they will seek extradition to bring him before their courts. <br /><br />Last week, Kyrgyzstan interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] said that Bakiyev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">should stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for the recent violence. The protests, prompted in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, led to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D0YG20100414">at least 84 deaths</a> [Reuters report] and many more injuries. Earlier this month, Otunbayeva launched the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">interim government</a> [JURIST report] after the violence forced Bakiyev to flee the capital. The protests came just one week after UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] urged Kyrgyzstan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">protect all forms of human rights</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;free speech and freedom of the media.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] voted 437-0 Friday to approve a bill giving amnesty to veterans as well as concentration camp and Leningrad siege survivors for most crimes committed during World War II by. If approved in the upper house, the <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/International/2010/04/16/Russia-grants-WW-II-vets-housing-amnesty/UPI-73871271468434/">bill would apply</a> [UPI report] to an estimated 100-200 persons, but the amnesty would not apply to crimes of murder or sexual crimes against minors. The legislative action <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15033499&PageNum=0"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">commemorates</font></a> [ITAR-TASS report] the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Great Patriotic War, as the period of the war along the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1945 is known in Russia.<br /><br />The legislative measure may be part of Russian efforts to rehabilitate the image of the Soviet Union. In October, a Russian historian who was researching Soviet treatment of German prisoners of war during World War II was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/russia-charges-wwii-historian-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with violating privacy laws. Also in October, a Russian court <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8305759.stm">rejected a libel suit</a> [BBC report] brought by Stalin&#39;s grandson Yevgeny Dzhugashvili against the Russian newspaper <font style="font-style: italic;">Novaya  Gazeta</font> for a report that Stalin ordered the death of Soviet citizens. In September, critics of this rehabilitation expressed outrage when a renovated Moscow train station was unveiled with <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/24/russia.stalin.controversy/index.html">inscriptions praising Stalin</a> [CNN report]. A controversial December 2008 poll found that Russians considered Stalin the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7802485.stm">third most popular Russian</a> [BBC report] in history, a result criticized by many.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered <a href="www.hhs.gov">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/">Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official profile] to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-memorandum-hospital-visitation">expand the rights</a> [memo] of patients and non-related visitors in hospitals that receive funding from <a href="http://www.cms.gov/home/medicaid.asp">Medicaid</a> and <a href="www.medicare.gov">Medicare</a> [official websites]. The rules that Obama asked HHS to establish are designed to ensure that hospitals respect the rights of patients&#39; advance directives, such as designating visitors and powers of attorney, and that visitors may not be denied rights for discriminatory purposes. Obama requested that HHS:<br /><blockquote><br />ensure that hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid respect the rights of patients to designate visitors. It should be made clear that designated visitors, including individuals designated by legally valid advance directives (such as durable powers of attorney and health care proxies), should enjoy visitation privileges that are no more restrictive than those that immediate family members enjoy. You should also provide that participating hospitals may not deny visitation privileges on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.<br /></blockquote><br />Gay rights group the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/index.htm">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrc.org/14307.htm">welcomed the order</a> [press release] as an &quot;important step[] to protect the visitation and healthcare decision-making rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people.&quot;<br /><br />Obama pledged during his presidential campaign to make expanding gay rights a priority of his administration. Last month, US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Defense Secretary Robert Gates</a> [official profile] announced <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-defense-secretary-announces-stricter.php">changes to the enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the controversial <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell</a> [10 USC &sect; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Don%27t+ask%2Cdon%27t+tell">news archive</a>] policy to make it more difficult to expel openly gay service members from the military. Obama has made clear that repealing the policy is a top priority for his administration, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/gay-rights-activists-march-in-dc-as.php">pledging to end it</a> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">reiterating his commitment</a> [JURIST reports] in the State of the Union address. In August, a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1584:">bill</a> [S 1584 materials] aimed at banning workplace discrimination motivated by an employee&#39;s sexual orientation or gender identification was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/sexual-orientation-anti-discrimination.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website]. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), if passed, would protect employees from discriminatory hiring and firing practices, and from segregation or classification on the basis of sexual preference or gender identity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former commander of the Bosnian army during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">1992-1994 Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/delic/cis/en/cis_delic_en.pdf">Rasim Delic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF; Trial Watch <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/rasim_delic_273.html">profile</a>] died Friday of cancer in his home. Delic was awaiting a decision from the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] on his appeal from his 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-sentences-bosnian-commander-delic.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Delic was found guilty of cruel treatment for failing to prevent abuses committed by his army detachment to detained Bosnian Serb Army soldiers, although he did not order them. He was <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/9968">sentenced</a> [press release] to three years in prison after a majority of the trial chamber judges found Delic &quot;to have had imputed knowledge of these crimes, as opposed to actual knowledge.&quot;<br /><br />Delic is one of the highest-ranking Bosnian military leaders to stand trial before the tribunal. The ICTY trial of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case  materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news  archive</a>] resumed earlier this week after multiple delays. In March, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/offthecuff.asp?nid=1391">said</a> [transcript] that the ICTY will <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icty-to-remain-in-operation-beyond-2010.php">continue to operate</a> [JURIST report] beyond its originally planned end of 2010 until 2013 because two high-ranking subjects remain at large. The ICTY has indicted 161 political and military officials since its creation in 1993.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041910zor.pdf">granted <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [order list, PDF] in four cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08-1423.htm">Costco v. Omega</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/08-1423_pet1.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000109----000-.html">first-sale doctrine</a> [17 USC &sect; 109(a)], which provides that the owner of any particular copy &quot;lawfully made under this title&quot; may resell that good without the authority of the copyright holder, applies to imported goods manufactured abroad. Swiss watchmaker <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/">Omega</a> [corporate website] manufactures watches in Switzerland and then sells them to authorized distributors overseas. Watches were purchased by third parties and eventually sold to <a href="http://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> [corporate website], which sold them to US consumers without authorization from Omega. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/09/03/0755368.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to imported goods.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-400.htm">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/09-400_pet1.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider in what circumstances an employer may be held liable based on the unlawful intent of officials who caused or influenced but did not make the ultimate employment decision. Vincent Staub sued his former employer under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/vets/usc/vpl/usc38.htm">Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act</a> (USERRA) [text] for wrongful termination. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=08-1316_017.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the unlawful intent of the officials who allegedly brought about Staub&#39;s dismissal could not be attributed to the employer.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-846.htm">United States v. Tohono O&#39;odham Nation</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/09-846_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1500.html">28 USC &sect; 1500</a> [text] deprives the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Federal Claims</a> (CFC) [official website] of jurisdiction over a claim seeking monetary relief for the government&#39;s alleged violation of fiduciary obligations if the plaintiff has another suit pending in federal district court based on substantially the same operative facts, especially when the plaintiff seeks monetary relief or other overlapping relief in the two suits. 28 USC &sect; 1500 provides that the CFC lacks jurisdiction over &quot;any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff has any suit or process against the United States&quot; or its agents &quot;pending in any other court.&quot; The Tohono O&#39;odham Nation filed a complaint against the US in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, and, one day later, it filed a similar complaint against the US in the CFC. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-5043.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the CFC&#39;s dismissal of the case, concluding &quot;that the Nation&#39;s complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeks relief that is different from the relief sought in its earlier-filed district court action.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-907.htm">Ransom v. MBNA</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/09-907_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether, in calculating the debtor&#39;s &quot;projected disposable income&quot; during the plan period, the bankruptcy court may allow an ownership cost deduction for vehicles only if the debtor is actually making payments on the vehicles. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/08/14/08-15066.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the bankruptcy court may not allow such deductions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The German government said Saturday that it is considering taking legal action against <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman, Sachs &amp;  Co.</a> [corporate website] for defrauding investors, according to a <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl=de&tl=en&u=http://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article7225859/US-Bankenskandal-schuert-Angst-vor-neuer-Krise.html&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&anno=2&usg=ALkJrhhTdALMoWU5_I5a-GAEjwV9aIc-rA">report</a> [text, in German] by the German newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Welt am Sonntag</span>. The announcement comes just a day after the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp-pr2010-59.pdf">civil suit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sec-charges-goldman-sachs-with.php">report</a>] on alleging securities fraud against the bank. German government spokesperson Ulrich Wilheim said that the <a href="http://www.bafin.de/cln_171/EN/Home/homepage__node.html?__nnn=true">German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority</a> (BaFin) [official website] will request information from the SEC to decide whether to file a suit.

Goldman&#39;s alleged conduct in marketing <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp">collateralized debt obligations</a> (CDOs) [Investopedia backgrounder] to investors lies at the core of the controversy. Goldman <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/press/press-releases/current/response.html">responded</a> [press release] to the allegations by denying all wrongdoing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/assets/pdf/FFRF_v_Obama_Order.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that the <a href="http://www.ndptf.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> [official website] is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. Judge Barbara Crabb issued summary judgment in favor of the <a href="http://www.ffrf.org/">Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> [advocacy website], which challenged <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/36/usc_sec_36_00000119----000-.html">36  USC &sect; 119</a> [text], establishing a day of prayer. The statute, passed in 1952 and amended in 1988 to make it the first Thursday in May, says the president will declare the day so people &quot;may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals.&quot; In her ruling, Crabb said the National Day of Prayer violates the First Amendment&#39;s <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]:<br /><blockquote><br />It goes beyond mere &quot;acknowledgment&quot; of religion because its sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer, an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function in this context. In this instance, the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience. &quot;When the government associates one set of religious beliefs with the state and identifies nonadherents as outsiders, it encroaches upon the individual&#39;s decision about whether and how to worship.&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />The White House said that President Barack Obama still <a href="http://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/12239071343">intends to recognize</a> [official update] the day of prayer as he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamation-national-day-prayer">did last year</a> [proclamation text].<br /><br />Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a teacher-led <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ninth-circuit-upholds-pledge-of.php">recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance</a> [JURIST report] in public schools does not violate the Constitution&#39;s Establishment Clause. The court also upheld the use of the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on currency. In November, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a school district&#39;s policy prohibiting the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-upholds-school-ban-on.php">performance of religious holiday songs</a> [JURIST report] does not violate the Establishment Clause. Also that month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">license plates</a> [JURIST report] produced by the state bearing a picture of a cross in front of a stained glass window and the words &quot;I Believe&quot; violate the Constitution.

The SEC is seeking &quot;injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and other appropriate and necessary equitable relief from both defendants,&quot; remedies considered appropriate in securities fraud cases.<br /><br />The SEC action continues a trend in bringing action against financial corporations and their agents that engaged in allegedly illegal conduct at the start of the subprime mortgage downturn in 2007. Last year, two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-bear-stearns-fund-managers.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of securities-related charges. The June 2008 SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20625.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleged that the managers had taken leveraged positions in financial derivatives based on subprime mortgage-based assets and then taken steps to conceal ensuing losses from investors.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/04/19/harsh-war-harsh-peace">criticized</a> [report text] the violent and repressive conditions in southern Somalia that have been implemented by the Islamist group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18650/">al-Shabaab</a> [CFR backgrounder]. HRW interviewed more than 70 victims and witnesses, concluding that while some areas of the country under al-Shabaab rule are more stable when compared to areas under control of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12475/">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) [official website], that stability comes at a steep price. The report details the use of harsh punishments including beatings, amputations, and executions without due process for the victims. Women have been particularly affected by al-Shabaab rule and the implementation of harsh measures in the name of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia+law">news archive</a>]. According to the report:<br /><blockquote><br />Freedoms women took for granted in traditional Somali culture have been dramatically rolled back. In many areas, women have been barred from engaging in any activity that leads them to mix with men&#8212;even small-scale commercial enterprises that many of them depend on for a living. Al-Shabaab authorities have arrested, threatened, or whipped countless women for trying to support their families by selling cups of tea. [sic] In many areas, al-Shabaab officials require women to wear a particularly heavy type of abaya, a traditional form of Islamic dress that covers everything but the face, hands, and feet. Women who fail to do so are often arrested, publicly flogged, or both.<br /></blockquote><br />HRW also criticized the TFG and <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/AUC/Departments/PSC/AMISOM/amisom.htm">African Union Mission in Somalia</a> (AMISOM) [official website] for their roles in the continuing violence in Mogadishu, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/89690">stating</a> [press release], &quot;[a]ll sides are responsible for laws-of-war violations that continue unabated in Mogadishu. Many Somalis confront indiscriminate warfare, terrifying patterns of repression, and brutal acts of targeted violence on a daily basis.&quot;<br /><br />Somalia has endured a lengthy civil war and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6159735.stm">several rounds of failed peace talks</a> [BBC timeline] since the collapse of its last civil government in 1991. Last July, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights indicated that human rights violations committed during recent Somalian conflicts <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/somalia-violence-may-constitute-war.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In an attempt to avoid violence in Mogadishu, the Somali parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/somalia-parliament-votes-to-adopt.php">voted last April</a> [JURIST report] to adopt Islamic Sharia law as part of a cease-fire agreement with the country&#39;s Hizb al-Islamiya and al-Shabaab rebels. Somali <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7865808.stm">President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed</a> [BBC profile] had previously expressed his <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/somalia-president-announces-support-for.php">support</a> [JURIST report] for the adoption of a moderate form of Sharia as part of peace talks with the rebels.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Arkansas judge <a href="http://showtime.arkansasonline.com/e2/news/documents/2010/04/16/DOC041610.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that a state law prohibiting all unmarried couples from adopting or fostering children violates the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/Summary/ArkansasConstitution1874.pdf">Arkansas Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Critics claimed that the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/cole-v-arkansas-case-profile">Arkansas Adoption and Foster Care Act of 2008</a> [ACLU backgrounder], or Initiated Act I, was discriminatory because it prohibited all gay couples from adopting or fostering children as Arkansas does not recognize gay marriage. Judge Christopher Piazza of the <a href="http://www.co.pulaski.ar.us/districtcourt.shtml">Pulaski County Circuit Court</a> [official website] agreed and said that while the the law, passed via ballot initiative, was valid under the federal Constitution, it violates the Arkansas state constitution:<br /><blockquote><br />Initiated Act 1 prohibits cohabiting same-sex couples and heterosexual couples from becoming foster or adoptive parents. It does not prohibit them from becoming foster or adoptive parents if they do not cohabitate. However, the act significantly  burdens non-marital relationships and acts of sexual intimacy between adults  and forces them to choose between becoming a parent and having any type of meaningful intimate relationship outside of the marriage. This infringes upon the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed to all citizens of Arkansas.<br /></blockquote><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which brought the challenge against Initiated Act I, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/arkansas-court-strikes-down-parenting-ban">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release], saying it would allow more children in Arkansas to be adopted or fostered.<br /><br />The ballot measure was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> in November 2008 after being <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/arkansas-ballot-to-contain-proposed-ban.php">certified</a> [JURIST reports] the previous August. The measure followed a 2006 Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="http://courts.state.ar.us/opinions/2006a/20060629/05-814.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down an administrative regulation</a> [JURIST report] specifically prohibiting homosexuals from rearing foster children. Reacting to that decision, then-governor Mike Huckabee suggested that such a ban be <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-governor-wants-legislation.php">implemented through legislation</a> [JURIST report]. Arkansas, like many states, has amended its constitution to prohibit the recognition of <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kyrgyzstan Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office announced Friday that the son of deposed president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile], Maksim Bakiyev, faces charges of abuse of power and misuse of state credit. Maksim Bakiyev ran Kyrgyzstan&#39;s Central Agency for Development, Investment and Innovation and is <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Criminal_Case_Opened_Against_Ousted_Kyrgyz_Presidents_Son/2015572.html">accused of transferring</a> [RFE/RL report] USD $35 million of a $300 million loan from Russia into private bank accounts. In separate criminal cases, Maksim Bakiyev, along with his brother Marat and paternal uncle Janysh are also facing three charges of <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Criminal_Cases_Begun_Against_Kyrgyz_Presidents_Sons_Brother/2007985.html">premeditated murder and attempted murder</a> [RFE/RL report].<br /><br />Also Friday, Kyrgyzstan interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] announced that the government is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602751.html">working on a new constitution</a> [Reuters report] that will provide for a parliamentary democracy for the country. Kurmanbek Bakiyev officially <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/0416/Kyrgyzstan-president-resigns-leaving-new-leaders-in-full-control">resigned</a> [CSM report] from the presidency on Thursday after a week of political chaos following <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">violent political protests</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />Earlier this week, Otunbayeva said that Kurmanbek Bakiyev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">should stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for the recent violence. The protests, prompted in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, led to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D0YG20100414">at least 84 deaths</a> [Reuters report] and many more injuries. On Tuesday, Kyrgyzstan&#39;s interim government announced that the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-suspends.php">highest court will be suspended</a> [JURIST report] until a permanent government is established. Roza Otunbayeva launched the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">interim government</a> [JURIST report] last week after violence forced Bakiyev to flee the capital. The protests came just one week after UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] urged Kyrgyzstan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">protect all forms of human rights</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;free speech and freedom of the media.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal grand jury on Friday <a href="http://charlotte.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ce041610.htm">indicted</a> [press release] five former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater+">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] executives on charges of weapons violations and lying to criminal investigators. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-blackwater17-2010apr17,0,4058816.story">15-count indictment</a> [LAT report] charges five former executives, including former president Gary Jackson, with giving away certain weapons to the King of Jordan to curry favor and then lying on federal forms about where the weapons went. The indictment also charges the executives with trying to hide weapons purchases by acting through an intermediary, avoiding regulations on the export of short-barreled rifles, and making false statements to investigators. Jackson and other Blackwater officials have said that federal officials <a href="http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/usa/Former-Blackwater-President-Indicted-on-Weapons-Charges-91113024.html">knew of the weapons purchases</a> [VOA report] for years but did nothing. <br /><br />In February, the Iraqi government ordered approximately 250 former Blackwater employees to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report]. The government was reacting to a US federal court&#39;s December decision to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismiss charges</a> against five former Blackwater employees accused of <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">killing 17 innocent Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST reports] in 2007 because information against the defendants was obtained unconstitutionally. Earlier that month, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Blackwater, now known as Xe, to determine whether the company bribed the Iraqi government to allow Blackwater to continue operating in Iraq following the 2007 shootings. In January, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced that Iraq will <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iraq-to-file-suits-against-blackwater.php">file lawsuits against Blackwater</a> [JURIST reports] for the 2007 killings in both US and Iraqi courts. US Vice-President Joe Biden has said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-to-appeal-dismissal-of-charges.php">DOJ will appeal the dismissal</a> [JURIST report]. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts for the protection of US diplomats expired.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA39/003/2010/en/58d0de1d-719c-4c1f-9fcf-d6357caf619c/asa390032010en.pdf">called for an investigation</a> [public statement, PDF] into the deaths of 25 people during recent anti-government protests. The group stated that it would welcome a pledge by the Thai government to &quot;investigate promptly, effectively, and impartially the recent violence,&quot; and urges it to &quot;provide accountability for any violations by security forces as well as abuses by violent protesters.&quot; The protesters, known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8615712.stm">claim</a> [BBC report] that <a href="http://media.thaigov.go.th/pageconfig/viewcontent/viewcontent1e.asp?pageid=472&directory=1944&contents=26250">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abhisit+Vejjajiva">news archive</a>] came to power illegitimately and that he should resign and call for elections. After the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8612783.stm">death toll rose to 21</a>, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8628864.stm">Thai army was called in</a> [BBC reports] on Monday to prevent the protests from spreading into Bangkok&#39;s financial district. While AI&#39;s statement recognized that the military&#39;s use of force may have been justified by the fact that some of the protesters were armed with guns and grenades, the group also urged the Thai government to adhere to international principles on crowd dispersal and the use of force. Such principles dictate that law enforcement officials may use firearms only when less dangerous means are not practicable and only to the minimum extent necessary<br /><br />The protests are currently in their sixth week and have led to an increasingly hostile political climate in Thailand. Earlier this month, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-issues-arrest-warrants.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for at least 17 high-profile protesters, including top red shirt officials. Abhisit hopes that the arrest warrants will encourage the protesters to disperse. Abhisit was forced to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> earlier this month after a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-denies-injunction.php">refused to issue an injunction</a> [JURIST reports] against the protesters. The protesters are supporters of former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+Shinawatra">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from power</a> [JURIST report] during a 2006 military coup. Thaksin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <span style="font-style: italic;">in absentia</span> on corruption charges in October 2008. Despite the conviction, the Cambodian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cambodia-refuses-to-extradite-former.php">refused to extradite</a> [JURIST report] the ousted prime minister to face a two-year prison sentence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi <a href="http://www.ihec.iq/english/index.htm">Independent High Election Commission</a> (IHEC) [official website] on Monday ordered a manual recount of Baghdad province ballots cast in the March 7 <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST news archive], following fraud allegations. The election commissioner for the IHEC informed the public that the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/2010419105643872399.html">Baghdad recount would begin immediately</a> [Al Jazeera report], citing manipulation in voting stations. The ruling <a href="http://qanoon337.org/en/">State of Law</a> [official website] coalition of <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">profile</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-ruling-coalition-alleges-fraud-in.php">alleged fraud</a> [JURIST report] after a preliminary count showed the Iraqiya coalition of former prime minister <a href="http://www.ayadallawi.com/">Iyad Allawi</a> [official website, in Arabic; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/2010329495420860.html">profile</a>] held a slight lead. The results of the election are expected to have a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gK93GrzFIRSaZgVzTB8hwO0fxArw">significant role</a> [AFP report] in the direction of the Iraqi government, as the two main factions strive for control.<br /><br />Soon after the fraud allegations were first made last month, Iraqi election officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-election-officials-reject-calls.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the allegations and calls for a recount. Previously, the commission <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-election-commission-rejects.php">dismissed allegations of election fraud</a> [JURIST report] from a member of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=146">European Parliament</a> [official website]. The fraud allegations are the latest in a series of problems plaguing the elections. In February, an Iraqi appeals panel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-allows-28-banned.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 28 of the 500 candidates previously banned due to allegations of ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder] could stand in the election. The initial ban was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Arizona Senate approved a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">bill</a> [SB 1070 materials] on Monday that would establish one of the strictest <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] policies in the nation, requiring individuals suspected of being illegal immigrants to provide proof of their legal status. The bill proposes giving the police permission to determine the immigration status of any individual who arouses reasonable suspicion, criminalizing the hiring of illegal immigrants for day labor, and allowing citizens to sue the local government if they believe the policy is not being used properly. Proponents of the bill argue that the new law would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63I6TU20100419">decrease illegal immigration</a> [Reuters report] in the state, which borders Mexico. However, the bill has also been <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/press/Senate/49leg/2R/DEMOCRATIC+STATEMENT+IMMIGRATION+201004.DOC.htm">heavily criticized</a> [press release] by Arizona Democrats, as well as immigrant rights groups who say the proposed measures could <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0420-mahony-immigration-20100420,0,6923812.story">lead to racial profiling</a> [LAT report]. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/About_Gov.asp">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official profile] has five days to decide whether to veto or sign the bill into law.<br /><br />A week after the Arizona House <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-house-approves-tough-new.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill, US Senators <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorMcCain.Biography">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and <a href="http://kyl.senate.gov/constit_center/about.cfm">Jon Kyl</a> (R-AZ) [official profiles] supported the bill and announced on Monday their proposal for <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=18572270-e566-c8a0-a4a0-9e34320ee6e6">additional federal controls on illegal immigration</a> [press release], such as an increased National Guard presence and a 700-mile-long fence along the Arizona-Mexico border. In 2008, Arizona voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/immigration-ballot-measures-defeated-in.php">defeated a ballot measure</a> [JURIST report] dealing with illegal immigrants. The initiative would have revoked the business licenses of employers that knowingly hire illegal immigrants and would have strengthened penalties for identity theft.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] in The Hague <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/135/15877.pdf?PHPSESSID=02524950f0b771d99c82930776306510">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=au&case=135&k=88">case materials</a>] Tuesday that Uruguay may continue operating a pulp mill on the River Uruguay despite breaching its treaty obligations to Argentina. The ICJ found that Uruguay did <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/135/15895.pdf?PHPSESSID=02524950f0b771d99c82930776306510">not breach its substantive obligation</a> [press release, PDF] to Argentina to protect the environment under the 1975 <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/10/4/00018191.pdf">Statute of the River Uruguay</a> [text, PDF] by planning to construct two pulp mills. The court did find that Uruguay had breached its procedural duties laid out in the statute by not cooperating with Argentina and the Administrative Commission of the River Uruguay (CARU) during the development phase and prior to the construction of the Orion (Botnia) pulp mill, but concluded that shutting down the plant or ordering damages would not be an appropriate remedy. The ruling was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE63J28A20100420?type=marketsNews">criticized by environmental activists</a> [Reuters report] but welcomed by diplomats from both Argentina and Uruguay who hoped it would help repair relations between the two countries.<br /><br />The hearings for the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icj-begins-hearings-in-argentina.php">treaty dispute began</a> [JURIST report] in September. Argentina claimed that pollutants from the plant were <a href="http://www.elpais.com.uy/090914/ultmo-441923/ultimomomento/argentina-afirma-que-botnia-causa-dano-irreparable">causing extreme harm</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] to the river and surrounding environment and that Uruguay failed to obtain Argentina&#39;s approval before starting the project. In 2007, the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/icj-rejects-uruguay-bid-to-end-paper.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to order Argentina to prevent demonstrators protesting the plant from blocking traffic on roads and bridges into the country from Uruguay. In 2006, the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/icj-rejects-argentina-request-to-halt.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Argentina&#39;s request that Uruguay be ordered to stop construction on the plants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Indonesian <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Bahasa] voted 8-1 Monday to <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/putusan/putusan_sidang_Putusan%20PUU%20140_Senin%2019%20April%202010.pdf">uphold</a> [judgment, PDF, in Bahasa; <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/index.php?page=website.BeritaInternalLengkap&id=3941">press release</a>, in Bahasa] a controversial anti-blasphemy law enacted in 1965 by the first Indonesian president. The court rejected the legal challenge raised by a coalition of human rights groups and social activists <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/world/asia/20indo.html">supporting</a> [NYT report] the Wahid Organization, a civil organization that advocates for religious pluralism in Indonesia. Critics of the law, titled Presidential Decree for the Prevention of Blasphemy and the Desecration of Religions, argued that it is used to discriminate against minorities and violates freedom of religion. Eight of the judges found that the law is necessary to maintain public order and is respectful of the principle of religious freedom, called Pancasila in Indonesia. Dissenting judge Maria Farida, the first ever female member of the court, reasoned that the law should be revoked because it is at odds with the constitution since it only recognizes six religions and is used arbitrarily to suppress all other religions.<br /><br /><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] have been a controversial issue in several countries. Last month, the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ireland-justice-minister-proposes.php">proposed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] to remove the criminal offense of blasphemy from the <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/Pdf%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland.pdf">Irish Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Blasphemy is a punishable offense under section 40 of the constitution, but the language of the text had been deemed too vague to hold any prosecutions. In February, a Pakistani government official said that the country would begin to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/pakistan-to-revise-blasphemy-laws.php">revise its blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST report] later this year. Pakistan currently punishes blasphemy against Islam by death, but no one has yet been executed for the offense. Last year, the death sentence of Afghan journalism student <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kambaksh">Sayad Parwaz Kambaksh</a> [JURIST news archive] for blasphemy was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/afghan-journalism-student-death.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years&#39; imprisonment by an Afghan appeals court. Kambaksh was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/afghan-journalism-student-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] for distributing papers questioning gender roles under Islam. In 2008, the UK House of Lords <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-abolish.php">voted to abolish</a> [JURIST report] the criminal offenses of blasphemy and blasphemous libel from the UK common law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two political parties in eastern Sudan on Tuesday accused the ruling <a href="http://www.ncpsudan.net/">National Congress Party</a> (NCP) [party website] of using voter fraud and intimidation in gaining electoral victories in their region of the country during last week&#39;s national elections. Representatives of the Beja Congress party and the Democratic Congress for East Sudan have separately <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63J1GA20100420">accused members of the NCP</a> [Reuters report] of emptying of ballot boxes and compromising ballots in an effort to secure victory for their party. The Beja Congress also contend that fraud is indicated by the fact their party won only one seat on a state assembly and no seats at the national level. Reports from one electoral area have the NCP candidate winning with close to 18,000 votes compared to 839 for the eastern party candidate. Official results of the election have not yet been released by the <a href="http://www.nec.org.sd/new/english/index.php">National Election Commission</a> [official website], but indicators point to a strong national win by the NCP. Also on Tuesday, a representative of the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2010/4/140466.htm">commented</a> [transcript] on the elections, stating that they were not &quot;free and fair&quot; and that they did not meet international standards. It is expected that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] will win re-election when the results are announced.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] currently has an arrest warrant against al-Bashir charging him with seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-orders-trial-chamber-to-reconsider.php">considering</a> whether to add an additional charge of genocide to the warrant after overturning a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">March 2009 decision</a> [JURIST reports] by the Pre-Trial Chamber not to prosecute on the charge. The warrant has been <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant">controversial</a> [JURIST news archive], with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-joins-calls-for-icc-to-delay.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sudan-official-again-calls-for-un-to.php">Sudan</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/african-union-to-seek-delay-of-bashir.php">African Union</a> [JURIST reports] and others calling for the proceedings against al-Bashir to be delayed, and African Union leaders <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/au-leaders-agree-not-to-cooperate-with.php">agreeing</a> [JURIST report] not to cooperate with the ruling. Al-Bashir is accused of systematically targeting and purging the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa, three Arabic-speaking ethnic groups, under the pretext of counterinsurgency since 2003.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater+">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] contractors working for the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] will not face the death penalty for the alleged May 2009 shooting of two Afghans at an intersection in Kabul. Justin Cannon of Corpus Christi and Christopher Drotleff of Virginia Beach, were arrested in January and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/two-blackwater-employees-charged-in.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with 13 counts related to the shooting, including second-degree murder, attempted murder, and weapons charges. Federal prosecutors told a district court judge in a hearing on Monday that they will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63I6U220100419">not seek the death penalty</a> [Reuters report]. However, if convicted, the men could still face life in prison. The men have pleaded not guilty, and maintain that they fired at the vehicle in self defense, as it sped toward them. The trial is set for September 14. <br /><br />Last week, a federal grand jury <a href="http://charlotte.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/ce041610.htm">indicted</a> [press release] five former Blackwater executives on <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] of weapons violations and lying to criminal investigators. In February, the Iraqi government ordered approximately 250 former Blackwater employees to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report]. The government was reacting to a US federal court&#39;s December decision to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismiss charges</a> against five former Blackwater employees accused of <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">killing 17 innocent Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST reports] in 2007 because information against the defendants was obtained unconstitutionally. Earlier that month, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] is <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Blackwater, now known as Xe, to determine whether the company bribed the Iraqi government to allow Blackwater to continue operating in Iraq following the 2007 shootings. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts for the protection of US diplomats expired.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/index.htm">Oklahoma State Senate</a> [official website] voted to approve five anti-abortion bills on Monday, sending three to <a href="http://www.gov.ok.gov/index.php">Governor Brad Henry</a> [official website] for his approval and returning two to the <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma State House of Representatives</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/HB2656_ENR.RTF">first bill</a> [HB 2526 text, RTF] would prevent &quot;wrongful life&quot; lawsuits in which parents seek damages for a child born with a birth defect because the mother was unable to obtain an abortion. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/HB2780_ENR.RTF">second bill</a> [HB 2780 text, RTF] would require doctors to conduct a vaginal ultrasound at least one hour prior to an abortion while displaying and explaining the images. The <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/HB3075_ENR.RTF">third bill</a> [HB 3075 text, RTF] would require any facility conducting abortions to post a sign stating that it is against the law to be forced to have an abortion. Pending House approval, two additional bills would <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/HB3284_ENGR.RTF">require a woman to answer 38 questions</a> [HB 3284 text, RTF], including why she is seeking an abortion, and prohibit state health plans from <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/hb3290_engr.rtf">covering elective abortions</a> [HB 3290 text, RTF]. Senate Republican Pro Tempore <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/Senators/biographies/coffee_bio.html">Glenn Coffee</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_2010/pr20100420a.html">praised the bills</a> [press release] saying, &quot;Oklahomans have consistently voted and called for measures like these, and today we have held true to Oklahoma values.&quot; If approved by Henry, the bills would give Oklahoma the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. <br /><br />Earlier this month, Henry <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">signed three anti-abortion bills into law</a> [JURIST report], prohibiting abortions performed because of the gender of the fetus, protecting medical employees who refuse to participate in procedures such as abortion based on religious beliefs, and regulating a chemical used in abortion procedures. The measures signed by the governor and the provisions of the bills passed Monday were previously included in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/oklahoma-judge-strikes-down-multi-part.php">larger state law struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] last month for violating the <a href="http://oklegal.onenet.net/okcon/">Oklahoma Constitution</a> [text], which requires legislation to be limited to one subject. In February, an Oklahoma state court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/oklahoma-judge-strikes-down-multi-part.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a different <a href="http://www.sos.state.ok.us/documents/Legislation/52nd/2009/1R/HB/1595.pdf">state law</a> [HB 1595, PDF], making it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion based on the gender of a fetus and requiring numerous reporting requirements, also violated the state constitution&#39;s single subject requirement. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website], which initially filed lawsuits against the bills, has indicated that it will challenge the constitutionality of the separated bills. Staff Attorney Stephanie Toti <a href="/hotline/#5939865606985017885">criticized the laws</a> [JURIST comment], arguing that &quot;they violate a myriad of constitutional principles, from freedom of speech to due process to equal protection of the law.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/index.html">Toyota Motor Corporation</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=toyota">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">accepted a record civil penalty of $16.375 million</a> [press release] imposed by the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website] for a four-month delay in notifying the agency about a problem with &quot;sticky&quot; and &quot;slow to return pedal&quot; gas pedals in various car models. US Department of Transportation <a href="http://www.dot.gov/bios/lahood.htm">Secretary Ray LaHood</a> [official profile] announced that Toyota has acknowledged responsibility for violating its legal obligations to report any defects promptly. The fine, the largest ever assessed against a car maker, is based on a preliminary review of extensive corporate documents attained through an <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot2910.htm">investigation</a> [press release] launched by the NHTSA in February. Toyota declined to appeal the fine, and, if further defect-related violations are discovered, the NHTSA may increase the penalty. NHTSA <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/Cfc_title49/MVS01092008.pdf">statutes</a> [text, PDF] require that a vehicle manufacturer notify the NHTSA within five days of discovering a safety defect and launch a recall. The NHTSA has evidence that Toyota knew of the defect in late September, but notification and a recall were not launched until January.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/">US Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation</a> (MDL) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-federal-panel-consolidates-lawsuits.php">consolidated more than 150 pending lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] against Toyota and transferred them to the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] where Judge James Selna <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-sets-date-for-toyota.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a May 13 pre-trial conference. In March, the NHTSA enlisted the help of the <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> [official websites] to conduct a 15-month investigation into the sources of recent safety defects. The agency has faced a <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20100223/Transcript.OI.02232010.pdf">hearing</a> [transcript, PDF] before the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/">House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/m/29240798/nhtsa-s-failure.htm">strong criticism</a> [FOXNews video] regarding the effectiveness of its recent investigations into car safety defects. Previously, the largest fine assessed by the NHTSA was of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/13/pf/autos/gm_nhtsa_fine/index.htm">$1 million</a> [CNN report] against General Motors for failing to conduct a timely recall in 2004. At the time, the NHTSA was also <a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/nhtsa011405.htm">criticized</a> [CCR report] for appearing to be lenient on the American vehicle manufacturer. Toyota has been under <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX&javax.portlet.prp_4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_viewID=detail_view&itemID=525a58d643767210VgnVCM1000002fd17898RCRD&viewType=standard&detailViewURL=/portal/site/nhtsa/template.MAXIMIZE/menuitem.416f74e8613992381601031046108a0c/?javax.portlet.tpst=4427b997caacf504a8bdba101891ef9a_ws_MX">federal scrutiny</a> [NHTSA materials] since December 2009, and has conducted three recalls.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kyrgyzstan&#39;s provisional government on Monday announced a plan to institute democratic reforms, including a referendum on a new constitution. The plan seeks to move Kyrgyzstan <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LDE63I0EG.htm">toward a parliamentary republic</a> [Reuters report] with increased checks and balances and a reduction in the constitutional scope of presidential power. In order to increase the perceived legitimacy of the process, the government has stated it will invite UN officials to join Kyrgyzstan&#39;s Central Election Committee. The pledge for reform follows an <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">anti-government uprising</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that forced president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile] from office and led to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">formation of an interim government</a> [JURIST report] headed by former foreign minister <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile]. The interim government has taken a number of steps, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-suspends.php">suspending the constitutional court</a> [JURIST report] because of the court&#39;s perceived support for Bakiyev. It was also reported on Monday that Bakivey had <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/19/ap/asia/main6410434.shtml?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CBSNewsHannahsBlog+(Hannah's+Blog%3A+CBSNews.com)">fled Kazakhstan</a> [AP report], where he had been hiding since his ouster.<br /><br />On Sunday, the interim Kyrgyz government announced that Bakiyev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-to-try.php">will be tried</a> [JURIST report] for killings that took place during the uprising. Last week, the Kyrgyzstan Prosecutor General&#39;s Office announced that Bakiyev&#39;s son <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/son-of-deposed-kyrgyzstan-president.php">faces charges</a> [JURIST report] of abuse of power and misuse of state credit. UN <a href="http://www.unece.org/Welcome.htm">Economic Commission for Europe</a> (UNECE) [official website] Executive Director <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=140">Jan Kubis</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34394&Cr=peacebuilding&Cr1=">stated</a> [press release] Friday that Kyrgyzstan needs international support in order to continue democratic reforms. UN officials have also pointed to concerns over human rights in Kyrgyzstan. Earlier this month, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">called on Kyrgyzstan</a> [JURIST report] to show &quot;tolerance for diversity and media freedom.&quot; Kyrgyzstan&#39;s recent problems mirror many of those addressed in 2005 when Bakiyev assumed power in the Tulip Revolution.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1371.pdf">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-takes-student-religious.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a state law school may deny recognition to a religious student organization where the group requires its officers and voting members to agree with its core religious beliefs, thereby excluding gay students. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08-1371_ca9.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the law school. Counsel for the petitioner argued that, &quot;[a] public forum for speech must be open and inclusive, but participants in the forum are entitled to their own voice.&quot; Counsel for the respondents argued that all organizations must abide by the school&#39;s open membership policy. The justices appeared split along ideological lines, but much of their questioning focused on the facts of the case rather than the broader constitutional question.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1332.pdf">City of Ontario v. Quon</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-to-hear-fourth-amendment.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether a special weapons and tactics (SWAT) team member has a reasonable expectation of privacy in text messages sent to and from his SWAT pager, where the police department has an official no-privacy policy, but a non-policymaking lieutenant announced an informal policy of allowing some personal use of the pagers. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/06/18/0755282.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the SWAT team member had a reasonable expectation of privacy and that a search of his text messages violated his <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. Counsel for the petitioners argued that, &quot;[u]nder the less restrictive constitutional standards applied when government acts as employer, as opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment violation here.&quot; Counsel for the US argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the city. Counsel for the respondents argued that, &quot;[t]he scope of the search was unreasonable.&quot; Several of the justices appeared to side with the government employer, with Justice Steven Breyer saying, &quot;I don&#39;t see anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about [the search].&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/Default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.president.gov.pk/Pages/PressRoomInformationDetail.aspx?ID=737">signed into law</a> [press release] the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/govt_bills/govt_bill2010/constitution_eighteenth_amendment_act2010_060410.pdf">18th Amendment bill</a> [text, PDF], limiting presidential powers expanded under former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>]. Under the amendment, which effectively reduces the role of the president to a figurehead, the vast majority of the president&#39;s powers will be <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/pakistan/Key-points-of-Pakistani-constitutional-reform/533274/H1-Article1-533209.aspx">transferred</a> [AFP report] to the <a href="http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/Cabinet/%21ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwML82BTAyNXTz9jE0NfQwNDE_1wkA6zeAMcwNFA388jPzdVvyA7rxwAicV1Mg%21%21/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwODdTNTAyRUlOMzQxTTEwOTQ%21/?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/wps/wcm/connect/CabDivCL/division/secretary/prime+minister">office of the prime minister</a> [official website]. The president will no longer have the power to appoint heads of the armed forces, dissolve the parliament or dismiss the prime minister.

Earlier this month, Pakistan&#39;s attorney general Anwar Mansoor <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-ag-resigns-amid-corruption.php">announced his resignation</a> over controversy surrounding a Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">order to investigate corruption allegations</a> [JURIST reports] against Zardari. Last month, Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zardari. Aides to Zardari believe that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf. The amnesty was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by Musharraf as part of a power-sharing accord allowing former Pakistani prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC profile] to return to the country despite <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/former-pakistan-pm-bhutto-facing.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] she had faced.

		<title>Russia Constitutional Court upholds ban on jury trials for terrorism suspects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia&#39;s <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/Pages/Default.aspx">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on Monday <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/News/Pages/ViewItem.aspx?ParamId=773">upheld</a> [judgment text, in Russian] the practice of trying terrorism cases in the absence of juries. Several Russian citizens had challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the country&#39;s Criminal Procedure Code, which provided that criminal cases involving crimes under articles 205 (terrorist act), 278 (violent seizure of power or forcible retention of power) and 279 (armed rebellion) are not considered with the participation of a jury, but rather by three judges. The petitioners argued that this practice violates the right to trial by jury, which is envisaged in Russia&#39;s <a href="http://www.gov.ru/main/konst/konst0.html">Constitution</a> [text, in Russian]. They also cited Article 55 of the Constitution, under which the country is barred from passing laws that abrogate or derogate from human rights. The Constitutional Court disagreed, finding that the constitution only guarantees jury trials in cases where the defendants could be sentenced to death. In other situations, the court said the right to trial by jury is defined by federal legislation. The court emphasized the impartiality and professionalism of the judges in Russia tasked with trying terrorism cases, noting that this would ensure fair trials for terrorism suspects. <br /><br />Russia has been tightening its anti-terrorism and other national security legislation recent years, leading to concerns that some of the reforms infringe on human rights. The provision banning jury trials for terrorism suspects was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-president-approves-law-ending.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">Dmitry President Medvedev</a> [official website] at the beginning of 2009. Also last year, a spokesperson for Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-president-to-order-review-of-new.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his administration would modify a legislative proposal that would change the definition of treason, state secrets, and espionage. Last month, Medvedev proposed amending the country&#39;s terrorism legislation in the wake of twin <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/twin-moscow-metro-bombings-kill-39/402801.html">suicide bombing attacks</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report] on Moscow subway stations. Literature including <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/russia-prosecutors-ban-mein-kampf-for.php">Mein Kampf</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-supreme-court-bans-jehovahs.php">34 religious books</a> [JURIST reprots] related to the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses have been banned recently under the country&#39;s extremism laws.

The petitioner, Brian Dolan, attacked a hitchhiker and was ordered to pay restitution to his victim. He argued that the court&#39;s restitution order came after the deadline imposed by the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/08/08-2104.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that &quot;a tardy restitution order is not an invalid one.&quot; Counsel for Dolan argued Tuesday that, &quot;[o]nce that 90-day period has run ... the district court loses the authority to impose restitution.&quot; Counsel for the United States argued that the court may impose restitution after the 90-day period in certain circumstances.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ola/div_olc.aspx?section=olc">Chief Legal Counsel</a> [official website] to the UN, Under-Secretary-General <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ola/media/info_from_lc/CV.pdf">Patricia O&#39;Brien</a> [official profile, PDF], and Cambodia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister Sok An said Monday that the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] needs financial support from the international community. In a <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/jointst19Apr2010.htm">joint statement</a> [text; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34417&Cr=&Cr1">report</a>], O&#39;Brien and Sok expressed concern about the financial situation of the UN-backed tribunal charged with trying alleged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khmer+Rouge">news archive</a>] war criminals, but also emphasized the great success that the tribunal has had:<br /><blockquote><br />The ECCC has confirmed its ability to conduct complex international criminal trials to international standards, and is living up to the hope for it to be a model court. The proceedings have attracted unprecedented interest and support, as witnessed by the fact that over 30,000 Cambodians have attended the court proceedings since its inception.<br /></blockquote><br />As of December, UN member countries had <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/09_Finances.htm">contributed</a> [financial report] nearly $77 million in support of the Khmer Rouge trials. The ECCC&#39;s <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/annual_reports.aspx">approved budget</a> [ECCC materials] for 2010-2011 amounts to $87.1 million, of which $42.9 million is for 2010 and $44.2 million is for 2011. The international component of the ECCC budget is $65.4 million, of which $32.2 million is for 2010 and $33.2 million is for 2011.<br /><br />In December, the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/cambodia-war-crimes-court-charges_21.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former Khmer Rouge leader <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/thirith_ieng_702.html">Ieng Thirith</a> [Trial Watch profile; <a href="http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/trial-proceedings/ieng-thirith.html">case materials</a>] with genocide, torture, and persecution, adding to previous charges that include war crimes and murder. Ieng Thirith, the wife of ECCC defendant <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ieng_sary_660.html">Ieng Sary</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ieng+sary">news archive</a>], served as social affairs minister for the regime. Ieng Thirith is the fourth former official to be charged with genocide. Also in December, the ECCC brought genocide charges against former head of state <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/cambodia-war-crimes-court-charges.php">Khieu Samphan</a>, former deputy leader and chief ideologist <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/cambodia-war-crimes-court-issues-first.php">Nuon Chea, and former foreign minister Ieng Sary</a> [JURIST reports] in connection with the same events. In November, the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">heard final arguments</a> [JURIST report] in its first trial, that of <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=duch">news archive</a>], also known as &quot;Duch.&quot; Kaing was the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">first of eight</a> [JURIST report] ex-Khmer Rouge officials to be tried before the ECCC. Members of the Khmer Rouge allegedly killed 1.7 million people between 1975 and 1979.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] British human rights lawyers on Monday submitted documents to a UK High Court that allege <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/general/news.php?id=132">Britain allowed Afghan detainees to be tortured</a> [press release] following their transfer to Afghanistan authorities. The documents were submitted by <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/index.php">Public Interest Lawyers</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of human rights and anti-war activist Maya Evans, who is seeking a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/04/20/britain-detainees.html">judicial inquiry</a> [CBC report] into Britain&#39;s policy for transferring detainees in Afghanistan. Evans alleges that British officials turned over al Qaeda and Taliban suspects to Afghanistan&#39;s National Directorate of Security (NDS), which is believed to have <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/detainee-torture-allegations-spread-to-britain/article1539932/">used torture</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report] as a means of interrogating prisoners. The documents detail nine cases of detainee abuse, including the use of physical beatings, electrocution, and sleep deprivation. The application for review has been opposed by <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/People/Ministers/SecretaryOfStateForDefence.htm">Secretary of State for Defence Bob Ainsworth</a> [official profile], who has said that safeguards were put in place to prevent abuse.<br /><br />Concerns over detainee abuse were first brought to light in a 2007 <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA110112007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/nato-forces-exposing-detainees-to.php">report</a>] by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], which said that the <a href="http://www.nato.int/isaf/index.html">International Security Assistance Force</a> (ISAF) [official website], led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), was exposing terrorism detainees to risks of torture by transferring NATO-held detainees into custody of Afghanistan authorities. Amnesty&#39;s report focused on actions by Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK, saying that the forces from those countries have been transferring terror detainees to the NDS, despite numerous reports of torture. The report prompted Evans to bring her suit seeking judicial review in 2008. The case mirrors similar allegations that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=canada%2C+afghan%2C+detainee">Canadian military officials were complicit</a> [JURIST news archive] in the torture of detainees that were transferred to Afghanistan officials.

Stevens</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-animal.php">report</a>] that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=48&url=/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &sect; 48 text] banning depictions of animal cruelty violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/052497p.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the law illegally restricts speech, overturning the conviction of Robert Stevens, who was prosecuted for selling videos depicting dog fights. In upholding the opinion below, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court that the statute is, &quot;substantially overbroad, and therefore invalid under the First Amendment.&quot; Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissenting opinion. Instead of applying the doctrine of overbreadth, Alito, &quot;would vacate the decision below and instruct the Court of Appeals on remand to decide whether the videos that respondent sold are constitutionally protected.&quot;<br /><br />The statute establishes a criminal penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone who knowingly &quot;creates, sells, or possesses a depiction of animal cruelty,&quot; if done &quot;for commercial gain&quot; in interstate or foreign commerce. It was originally intended to ban &quot;crush videos,&quot; which feature small animals being tortured and killed. Stevens was charged under the statute for selling videos of dog fights. Dogfighting is illegal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Milan judges presiding over the tax fraud trial of Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] suspended the trial Monday while <a href="http://www.asca.it/focus-SI_FERMA_IL_PROCESSO_MEDIASET__PAROLA_ALLA_CONSULTA_SULLEGITTIMO_IMPEDIMENTO-3121.html">consulting</a> [ASCA report, in Italian] with a <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/index.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on the legitimacy of a new law that Berlusconi has invoked to postpone criminal proceedings against him for 18 months. The case is the second to be suspended this month, with the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iLhvfVgbZ8aA5rEk-m6UALXKc3iA">corruption trial postponed</a> [AFP report] last Friday. The law in question was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March and allows cabinet officials to postpone criminal proceedings against them for up to 18 months if the charges constitute a &quot;legitimate impediment&quot; to performing public duties. The judges are <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/collection/rubriche/politica/2010/04/16/visualizza_new.html_1763383229.html">questioning</a> [ANSA report, in Italian] whether the new law violates the Italian <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html">Constitution</a> [text] because it improperly creates a new faculty for cabinet members through a law rather than by constitutional amendment, and because it alters the equality of citizens under the law. Berlusconi maintains that the proceedings are politically motivated.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Italian prosecutors sought to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/dnp.php">indict</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi on additional <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-pm-berlusconi-may-face-third.php">fraud and embezzlement charges</a> [JURIST report] involving his media company Mediatrade, despite a new law granting the executive temporary immunity. In January, hundreds of Italy&#39;s judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-judges-walk-out-over-proposed.php">walked out</a> of their courtrooms to protest the passage of a law that placed <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-senate-approves-trial-time-limit.php">strict time limits</a> [JURIST reports] on the trial and appeals process. The law was criticized for being tailored for Berlusconi&#39;s benefit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Monday encouraged the six <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website, in Arabic; GlobalSecurity <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/gulf/gcc.htm">backgrounder</a>] states to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9972&LangID=E">address continuing rights issues</a> [press release], including women&#39;s rights, treatment of migrant workers, statelessness, and freedoms of expression, association, and assembly. In a speech at a university in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the first stop on a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9961&LangID=E">10-day tour</a> [press release] of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman, Pillay also noted &quot;encouraging&quot; progress in economic and social rights, children&#39;s rights, and human trafficking. Pillay was pleased with the cooperation of GCC states thus far with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/MeetingsHighlightsSession7.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [materials] process, reviewing the human rights records of all UN Member States every four years. Pillay additionally applauded the establishment of <a href="http://www.nhri.net/">national human rights institutions</a> (NHRIs) [official website] in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and recently in Bahrain and Oman, noting their &quot;growing effectiveness&quot; in promoting human rights. <br /><br />According to a <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/womens-rights-improving-in-middle-east.php">report</a> [JURIST report] released last month, women&#39;s rights and opportunities have increased the most in Persian Gulf countries, which were ranked as the worst violators of women&#39;s rights five years ago. Despite the progress, the report found that women still face many obstacles in achieving recourse for domestic violence and equality in employment, education, and politics. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">annual rights report</a> [JURIST report] released by the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] last month, criticized Saudi Arabia for violence against women. In February, Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/saudi-arabia-minister-to-propose-bill.php">proposed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow female lawyers to practice in some areas. In October, Kuwait&#39;s Constitutional Court ruled that female lawmakers are <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/kuwait-constitutional-court-rules-women_28.php">not required</a> [JURIST report] to wear the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hijab">hijab</a> [JURIST news archive], the traditional Islamic headscarf, and that women <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/kuwait-constitutional-court-rules-women.php">do not need permission</a> [JURIST report] to get a passport. A 2008 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] report found that female domestic and migrant workers <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/domestic-workers-facing-abusive.php">faced frequent abuse</a> [JURIST report] throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German federal prosecutors said Wednesday that they have charged former <a href="http://www.baader-meinhof.com/">Red Army Faction</a> (RAF) [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=red+army+faction">news archive</a>] member Verena Beckman for the 1977 murders of federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback and two other men. Beckman was originally arrested two months after Buback&#39;s assassination and served 12 years of a life sentence for her role in other killings before she was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8611020.stm">pardoned and freed</a> [BBC report] in 1989 by former president <a href="http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/germ_1949a/weizsaecker.php">Richard von Weizsaecker</a> [profile].  Prosecutors reopened the case in light of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j55wLA9gXKuXLXcTHmObGiorFv0QD9EV0EKG0">new DNA evidence</a> [AP report] linking Beckman to the high-profile murder. The RAF, commonly known as the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6314559.stm">Baader-Meinhof Gang</a>  [BBC backgrounder], was a leftist group that targeted political and financial institutions and personnel, killing 34 people between 1968 and 1998.<br /><br />Some reports allege that, in the aftermath of the RAF&#39;s terrorist attacks, German officials <a href="/hotline/2008/11/red-army-faction-leaders-release-shows.php">tortured RAF prisoners</a> [JURIST comment] and compromised their trials. In 2008, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/germany-court-grants-parole-to-former.php">granted parole</a> [JURIST report] for RAF leader Christian Klar after he served 26 years in prison on nine counts of murder and 11 counts of attempted murder. The court <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7745705.stm">found no grounds</a> [BBC report] on which continue to detain him, and he was released last year. Before being granted parole, Klar had called for the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,468956,00.html">defeat of capitalism</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Der Spiegel</span> report] and <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/germany-president-denies-clemency-for.php">lost an appeal for clemency</a> [JURIST report]. Other prominent RAF members, including <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/german-court-to-free-baader-meinhof.php">Brigitte Mohnhaupt</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/germany-paroles-former-red-army-faction.php">Eve Haule</a> [JURIST reports], have also been paroled in recent years.

Bignone served as de facto president from 1982 to 1983 and represents the last dictator to hold power during the military regime that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. The court <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8633823.stm">found Bignone guilty</a> [BBC report] of involvement in 56 cases of murder, torture, and kidnappings in one of Argentina&#39;s largest torture centers, the Campo de Mayo military base. The court also <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100420/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_argentina_last_dictator">sentenced</a> [AP report] five other retired military officers to prison terms ranging from 17 to 25 years in connection with abuses during the military regime. <br /><br />Bignone <a href="http://www.cij.gov.ar/nota-2811-Comenzo-el-juicio-oral-contra-Bignone-y-otros-seis-imputados.html">went on trial</a> [press release, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-argentina-president-goes-on.php">report</a>] in November on charges stemming from two separate federal court determinations that he should stand trial. In April 2007, Bignone was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/argentina-ex-president-to-face-trial-on.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for the kidnapping of children of dissidents killed during the &quot;Dirty War.&quot; Bignone had already been ordered in March 2007 to <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/argentina-ex-president-to-face-trial.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on separate charges connected to the illegal arrest, torture, and killing of dissidents at secret detention centers in Buenos Aires.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/index.html">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/UKSC_2009_0144_Judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Wednesday that the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/jan/18/childrensservices.politics1">sex offender registry</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> backgrounder] requirement violates the right to privacy. The case involved an appeal filed by two convicted sex offenders who challenged the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_6">notification requirement</a> [legislative materials] of Section 82 of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act, which mandates indefinite notification for any individual sentenced to 30 or more months in prison for a sex offense. The trial court ruled that Section 82 of the Act was incompatible with privacy rights guaranteed by Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials]. The Supreme Court considered several issues before affirming that dismissal, including how valuable the notification requirements are for achieving the goal of lower crime, and the extent of harm to that goal if the notification requirements were subject to review. The court considered empirical evidence that, over a 21-year period, 75 percent of sex offenders in the UK were not re-convicted, and that, despite the possibility that a convicted offender may be able to prove he will not re-offend, he or she has no recourse. Lord Phillips, writing for the court, concluded:<br /><blockquote><br />I think that it is obvious that there must be some circumstances in which an appropriate tribunal could reliably conclude that the risk of an individual carrying out a further sexual offence can be discounted to the extent that continuance of notification requirements is unjustified. As the courts below have observed, it is open to the legislature to impose an appropriately high threshold for review.<br /></blockquote><br />As the Court suggested, the UK legislature will have to craft a review process for the notification requirement. It is not clear what will happen to individuals already on the notification register, and any change will be delayed until the upcoming <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/">general election</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> backgrounder] has passed.<br /><br />Wednesday&#39;s ruling is the second high-profile result regarding individual rights and sex offenders in the UK in the past week. On Monday, a Pakistani man, currently serving a jail term for a sex offense, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7102298.ece">won an appeal against deportation</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times Online</span> report] because he has a wife and child in the UK and has lived there legally for 20 years. That ruling resulted in <a href="http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/burnley/8106006.Fury_as_jailed_East_Lancashire_sex_attacker_wins_deportation_fight/">significant public outrage</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Lancashire Telegraph</span> report], and the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office</a> [official website] has indicated it will appeal the ruling. There are currently more than 24,000 individuals in the UK subject to the registry requirement, and, in the past, the government has had to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3467879/Hundreds-of-sex-offenders-to-have-sentences-reduced-due-to-overcrowding.html">reduce the sentence</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> report] of some sex offenders because of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+prison+overcrowding">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive].

Carlisle</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-nfl.php">report</a>] that a debt collector&#39;s legal error does not qualify for the <span style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span> error defense under the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [15 USC &sect; 1692 text, PDF]. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0299p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that although the defendants violated the FDCPA by giving erroneous legal advice, they qualified for the FDCPA <span style="font-style:italic;">bona fide<span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span> error defense. In reversing the decision below, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court:<br /><blockquote><br />The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA or Act) imposes civil liability on &quot;debt collector[s]&quot; for certain prohibited debt collection practices. Section 813(c) of the Act provides that a debt collector is not liable in an action brought under the Act if she can show &quot;the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.&quot; This case presents the question whether the &quot;bona fide error&quot; defense in &amp;setc; 1692k(c) applies to a violation resulting from a debt collector&#39;s mistaken interpretation of the legal requirements of the FDCPA. We conclude it does not.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Antonin Scalia filed a concurring opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito.<br /><br />Petitioner Karen Jerman filed an action challenging the debt collection practices of the Carlisle law firm, claiming that they violated the FDCPA when they used allegedly deceptive forms to notify her of a foreclosure on her home. Specifically, Jerman claims that defendants violated the FDCPA by representing to Jerman that her debt would be assumed valid unless she disputed the debt &quot;in writing&quot; even though the FDCPA does not require a written dispute.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Netherlands Utrecht District Court on Thursday <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=BM1984&u_ljn=BM1984">acquitted</a> [decision, in Dutch; <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Actualiteiten/AEL+vrijgesproken+van+belediging+van+Joden.htm">press release</a>, in Dutch ] members of the Arab European League (AEL) of hate speech charges resulting from the posting a cartoon on their website that insinuated that the Holocaust was fabricated.  The criminal complaint against the group alleged that the cartoon violated Article 137c of the Dutch Penal Code, which punishes individuals for making discriminatory and defamatory statements against certain groups. The AEL argued that they do not actually deny the historical facts of the Holocaust, but that the cartoon was posted to call attention to what they saw as a double standard in the distribution of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoons">Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive].  The court held that the cartoon was offensive, but that, in light an accompanying disclaimer and subsequent statements regarding its purpose, it was nevertheless protected under Article 10 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]:<br /><blockquote> Although the cartoon, in the opinion of the court, is in very bad taste and very hurtful for Jews and others, the right to make this statement is ensured given its specific context and purpose.  In light of the case as a whole, an infringement on that right in the form of a criminal conviction is not proportional to the objective to which it serves. </blockquote>Prosecutors had sought for the court to consider the fact that Jewish groups were not involved in the creation or distribution of the Danish Mohammed cartoons, but the court refused.<br /><br />The Danish cartoons depicting Mohammed were originally  published in a Danish newspaper in 2005, leading to worldwide protests and lawsuits for those who reprinted the cartoons including suits in <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/yemen-editor-convicted-for-printing.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/france-newspaper-cleared-of-defamation.php">France</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/jordan-court-convicts-editors-for.php">Jordan</a> [JURIST reports].  The Danish government <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/denmark-prosecutor-rejects-charging.php">did not press criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against the Danish newspaper that originally printed the articles.  Last month, US citizen David Headley <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/mumbai-terror-suspect-pleads-guilty-in.php">plead not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 12 counts of federal terrorism, including charges related to an alleged plot against the Danish creator and publishers of the controversial cartoons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military panel in Iraq on Thursday acquitted <a href="http://www.sealchallenge.navy.mil/">Navy SEAL</a> [official website] Julio Huertas of any wrongdoing in connection with the alleged assault of a high-profile Iraqi detainee. A six-person jury <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/04/22/world/AP-ML-Iraq-SEAL-Trial.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=julio%20huertas&st=cse">found Huertas not guilty</a> [AP report] on charges of dereliction of duty and impeding an investigation for taking no action while a fellow SEAL allegedly punched and kicked Iraqi prisoner Ahmed Hashim Abed. US authorities believe Abed to be the mastermind behind the 2004 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive] contractor killings in Falluja. A US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/navy-seals-accused-of-assaulting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that Huertas&#39;s court-martial would be held at <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/abu_ghurayb-cc.htm">Camp Victory</a> [GlobalSecurity Backgrounder] in Baghdad, Iraq, so that Abed could testify against him. Two other Navy SEALs, Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe and Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, have also been charged in connection with the incident, and their trial is scheduled to begin Friday. <br /><br />Detainee abuse has been a major issue during the Iraq war. In September 2008, the <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/home">UK Defense Ministry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/uk-defence-ministry-admits-liability.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] the unlawful abuse of nine detainees and announced monetary compensation. Three British soldiers were ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-uk-soldiers-sentenced-in.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report], and dishonorably discharged. In 2005, another Navy SEAL was <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/seal-iraqi-prisoner-abuse-court.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with assault, dereliction of duty, and conduct unbecoming of an officer stemming from the treatment of an Iraqi prisoner. Abuse of detainees during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Iraq+War">Iraq War</a> [JURIST news archive] first garnered international attention after the 2004 release of pictures depicting prisoner abuse at <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/badapples/history.html">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [CBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">news archive</a>] in Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/20/kyrgyzstan-investigate-april-violence">urged</a> [press release] Kyrgyzstan&#39;s interim government to begin a comprehensive investigation into the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">violence</a> [JURIST report] between April 6 and 8 that resulted in the overthrow of president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile]. After conducting witness interviews and examining photo and video evidence, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/89836">concluded</a> [report text] that the violence was fueled by the actions of both security forces and demonstrators and called on the government to officially request assistance from the international community to &quot;help to safeguard against accusations of bias&quot; in the probe. HRW claims that authorities committed several violations of international law, which stipulates that lethal force may only be used as a last resort, citing in particular the alleged shooting of an unarmed man seeking to negotiate. The interim government is currently <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-government-to-try.php">planning to try</a> [JURIST report] members of Bakiyev&#39;s family and administration on charges that include corruption and human rights violations.<br /><br />Kyrgyz interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] said last week that Bakiyev should <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for the recent violence. Despite the pledge to bring Bakiyev and his allies to justice, so far only former defense minister Baktybek Kaliyev has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl9bo4DfKFLUi5Ciy_d6bAOU8Vdg">arrested</a> [AFP report]. It is believed that Bakiyev is currently in Belarus, and interim officials have said they will seek extradition to bring him before their courts. The protests, prompted in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, led to at <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D0YG20100414">least 84 deaths</a> [Reuters report] and many more injuries. Earlier this month, Otunbayeva <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">launched the interim government</a> [JURIST report] after the violence forced Bakiyev to flee the capital. The protests came just one week after UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] urged Kyrgyzstan to protect all forms of <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-protect-human.php">human rights</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;free speech and freedom of the media.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Five international <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/articles.php?pid=10005">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>] members <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=24392">will be tried</a> [MB press release] in an Egyptian criminal court on charges of money laundering, Attorney General Abdul Magid Mahmoud announced Wednesday. The members, including Muslim Brotherhood International Secretary General Ibrahim Munir, were referred to the Supreme State Security Emergency Court for trial. The five members have been accused of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ith1h5QhwH_K7mt2iZkFXvq22FgA">laundering money</a> [AFP report] through a British-based Islamic charity in order to fund the MB movement, which has been banned in <a href="/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a statement, MB media spokesman Mohamed Morsy said the charges are a move by the Egyptian government to escalate the tense relationship between the two: <blockquote>At a time when all opposition factors in Egypt including the MB are uniting in the call for the elimination of the oppressive &#39;Emergency Law&#39;, the ruling regime has once again demonstrated its inability to interact with its people and practice democracy. We, the MB, will continue the path of promoting peace and will continue calling for reform through the regulatory and legitimate constitutional channels in which we have always adhered to. None of the ruling regime&#39;s measures will deter us.</blockquote> The Egyptian government has often used the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.fidh.org/THE-EMERGENCY-LAW-IN-EGYPT">emergency laws</a> [FIDH backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Egypt+emergency+laws">news archive</a>] to arrest and indefinitely detain individuals it considered a threat to state security.<br /><br />Earlier this month, an Egyptian criminal court ordered 16 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, who were arrested in February and charged with plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/egypt-court-orders-release-of-16-muslim.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report]. In the past, Egypt has also used the emergency laws extensively against other opposition parties. In July, the trial of 26 individuals with alleged ties to Hezbollah was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/egypt-to-try-26-hezbollah-linked-terror.php">transferred to a court</a> [JURIST report] established under the emergency laws. In February 2009, a military court utilized the laws during a trial in which it <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/egypt-court-imprisons-opposition-leader.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] opposition leader Magdy Ahmed Hussein to two years in prison. The emergency laws have been in effect continuously since the 1981 assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/egypt-extends-emergency-laws-despite.php">were renewed</a> [JURIST report; JURIST op-ed] most recently in May 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thai <a href="http://media.thaigov.go.th/pageconfig/viewcontent/viewcontent1e.asp?pageid=472&directory=1944&contents=26250">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abhisit+Vejjajiva">news archive</a>] announced Wednesday that he is prepared to negotiate with protesters once they cease their illegal conduct. Government spokesperson Panitan Wattanyagorn stated that the prime minister is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8633893.stm">willing to speak with protesters</a> [BBC report] regarding an election and amending the constitution once protesters abide by the law. Anti-government protesters, known as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">red shirts</a> [BBC backgrounder], have been associated with a series on <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g3j-vAVG1fg3kEfnogTiH8_4EXvwD9F7FCMG0">unlawful acts</a> [AP report], including blocking a train carrying military vehicles and fortifying their base area with tire barriers and homemade weapons. Their camp, which occupies Bangkok&#39;s business district, has forced businesses to close and suffer financial losses. Unidentified attackers have also caused fire damage after launching rocket-propelled grenades at a fuel depot near an airport. The red shirts <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8615712.stm">claim</a> [BBC report] that Abhisit came to power illegitimately and that he should resign and call for elections.<br /><br />The protests are currently in their sixth week and have led to an increasingly hostile political climate in Thailand. On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-group-urges-thailand-to.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the deaths of 25 people during recent anti-government protests. Earlier this month, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-issues-arrest-warrants.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for at least 17 high-profile protesters, including top red shirt officials. Abhisit hopes that the arrest warrants will encourage the protesters to disperse. Abhisit was forced to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> earlier this month after a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-denies-injunction.php">refused to issue an injunction</a> [JURIST reports] against the protesters. The protesters are supporters of former Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+Shinawatra">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from power</a> [JURIST report] during a 2006 military coup. Thaksin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <span style="font-style: italic;">in absentia</span> on corruption charges in October 2008. Despite the conviction, the Cambodian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/cambodia-refuses-to-extradite-former.php">refused to extradite</a> [JURIST report] the ousted prime minister to face a two-year prison sentence.

The rule permits an amended complaint to &quot;relate back&quot; for statute of limitation purposes when the amendment corrects a mistake concerning the proper party&#39;s identity. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/200816569.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the rule does not apply to substitution of the correct defendant for a related corporation with a similar name where the plaintiff has imputed knowledge of the identity of the added defendant prior to filing suit. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the rule should apply when substituting the correct defendant. Counsel for the respondent argued that there can be no mistake where the plaintiff knows all the facts. There is a circuit split on the issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of more than 30 privacy and civil liberty groups on Wednesday <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/petition_042110.pdf">asked</a> [petition, PDF; <a href="http://epic.org/2010/04/coalition-petition-homeland-se.html">press release</a>] the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] to suspend the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/imaging_technology.shtm">full body scanner</a> [TSA backgrounder] program being implemented by the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website]. The petition states that use of the full body scanner program is an invasion of <a href="/currentawareness/privacy.php">privacy</a> [JURIST news archive] and that:<br /><blockquote><br />deployment of Full Body Scanners in US airports, as currently proposed, violates the U.S. Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (&quot;RFRA&quot;), the Privacy Act of 1974 (&quot;Privacy Act&quot;), and the Administrative Procedures Act (&quot;APA&quot;). As described below, the FBS program effectively subjects all air travelers to unconstitutionally intrusive searches that are disproportionate and for which the TSA lacks any suspicion of wrongdoing.<br /></blockquote><br />According to the petitioners, the scanners are a step toward doing away with individualized suspicion and are particularly offensive to devout individuals. As such, the scans are <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/index.php?/rnstext/jews_muslims_say_body_scanners_violate_religious_laws/">opposed by religious groups</a> [RNS report]. The petition also alleges that the scanners themselves have two major flaws: they <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/are-planned-airport-scanners-just-a-scam-1856175.html">cannot detect powdered explosives</a> [<em>Independent</em> report], and the operating systems are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/29/AR2005122901456.html">vulnerable to attack</a> [WP report].<br /><br />In February, the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (EHRC) [official website] announced that full body scanners in use at two UK airports <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-rights-commission-says-airport-body.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report]. The body scanners were introduced in part as a response to the failed US bombing attempt by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6896128/Detroit-terror-attack-profile-of-Umar-Farouk-Abdul-Mutallab.html">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>] on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. The attempted attack prompted Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">announce tighter security measures</a>, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">civil rights groups opposed</a> [JURIST reports] as a pretext to racial profiling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] said Wednesday that he will take into account a potential nominee&#39;s position on individual liberty, including women&#39;s rights, when nominating a Supreme Court justice. Speaking at a meeting with Senate leaders, Obama acknowledged that <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] has been &quot;a hugely contentious issue in our country for a very long time&quot; and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-meeting-with-bipartisan-leaders-senate-and-senate-judiciary-commi">explained</a> [text] how his approach to choosing a nominee will take reproductive rights into account:<br /><blockquote><br />I am somebody who believes that women should have the ability to make often very difficult decisions about their own bodies and issues of reproduction. ... I will say that I want somebody who is going to be interpreting our Constitution in a way that takes into account individual rights, and that includes women&#39;s rights. And that&#39;s going to be something that&#39;s very important to me, because I think part of what our core ... constitutional values promote is the notion that individuals are protected in their privacy and their bodily integrity, and women are not exempt from that.<br /></blockquote><br />Obama met with Senate leaders from both parties in an effort to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iVIF9OnrgW2kTS53D8szV4l9GLewD9F7HJIG0">pave the way for a smooth confirmation</a> [AP report] for his eventual nominee. The meeting on Wednesday included Majority Leader <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (D-NV), Minority Leader <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY), Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT), and ranking committee Republican <a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/public/">Jeff Sessions</a> (R-AL) [official websites]. Obama said that he plans to announce his nomination by the end of May, and hopes to replicate last year&#39;s &quot;smooth, civil [and] thoughtful&quot; confirmation of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sotomayor">Justice Sonia Sotomayor</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/senate-judiciary-chair-predicts-speedy.php">Leahy predicted</a> that President Obama will nominate a replacement for <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/justice-stevens-to-retire-from-us.php">retiring</a> [JURIST reports] Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Justice John Paul Stevens</a> [official profile; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/author.php?stevens">materials</a>] in time for hearings to be concluded over the summer. In a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WSJ-20100409-StevensLetter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Obama explaining is retirement, Stevens said that &quot;it would be in the best interests of the Court to have my successor appointed and confirmed well in advance of the commencement of the Court&#39;s next Term.&quot; There had been much speculation about Stevens&#39;s possible retirement, and leading candidates for his replacement reportedly include <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/">Solicitor General Elena Kagan</a> [official profile] and federal appellate judges Merrick Garland and Diane Wood. Stevens, 89, was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Gerald Ford and was seated in December 1975. Stevens is the court&#39;s oldest and most senior member and has served as the leader of the court&#39;s liberal bloc. His retirement gives Obama his second opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice, following last year&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/justice-souter-to-retire-from-us.php">retirement of Justice David Souter</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/senate-confirms-sotomayor-for-supreme.php">confirmation of Sotomayor</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Rwandan authorities arrested opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://www.victoire2010.com/english/index.html">Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza</a> [campaign website] Wednesday, accusing her of denying the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>] and collaborating with terrorists. Authorities cited Ingabire&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iVrNFl32gefPf6AUc3CkpUb7Y9sA">call for the prosecution</a> [AFP report] of those who killed Hutus during the genocide, in which over 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slain, as evidence of her denial of the genocide. Prosecutors also alleged that Ingabire has collaborated with Hutu rebels in the Democratic Republic of Rwanda, which borders Rwanda. The arrest comes at a time when current Tutsi <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website] has received <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/02/10/rwanda-end-attacks-opposition-parties">criticism</a> [press release] from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] for his treatment of opposition parties. The <a href="http://www.fdu-rwanda.org/en/rwanda/index.html">United Democratic Forces</a> (FDU) [official website], the party chaired by Ingabire, released a statement Wednesday <a href="http://www.fdu-rwanda.org/en/rwanda/news-detail/article/mrs-victoire-ingabire-umuhoza-icon-of-the-struggle-for-freedom-democracy-and-justice-in-rwanda-ar/index.html">condemning the arrest</a> [press release]:<br /><blockquote><br />Such a barbaric and unlawful act against a peace loving mother who braved the system to show that there is another way to bring about lasting peace and development in Rwanda is not only a challenge to the conscience and dignity of the Rwandan people but also to the international community, in particular foreign governments who are sponsoring the government.<br /></blockquote><br />The UDF urged &quot;governments and peace loving people and organisations to support us in getting our chair immediately and unconditionally released.&quot;<br /><br />Rwanda continues to try those involved in the 1994 genocide. In March, an aid to Ingabire who had been convicted <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-opposition-politician-pleads.php">pleaded guilty to genocide charges</a> [JURIST report] in exchange for a reduced prison sentence of 17 years. The <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>] was established for the prosecution of high-level officials responsible for genocide and other serious violations of international humanitarian law during the Rwandan genocide. Last month, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-tribunal-affirms-genocide.php ">affirmed the genocide conviction</a> [JURIST report] of popular Rwandan singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/simon_bikindi_221.html">Simon Bikindi</a> [Trial Watch profile]. The court also reversed the conviction for counts of genocide, murder, and extermination against Rwandan district attorney Simeon Nchamihigo. Earlier in March, the widow of assassinated Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana, Agathe Habyarimana, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-ex-presidents-widow-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France on suspicions of complicity in genocide and was later released on bail. In January, the Rwandan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rwanda-report-finds-hutus-responsible.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] concluding that the assassination of then-president Juvenal Habyarimana, which sparked the genocide, was the work of Hutu extremists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-970.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-970">Perdue v. Kentucky</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on_14.php">report</a>] that calculation of an attorney&#39;s fee based on the lodestar may be increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary circumstances. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200615514.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the lower court&#39;s enhancement of attorney&#39;s fees in a class action suit, finding that even though factors such as quality of performance and results obtained are already included in the lodestar calculation, they may appropriately be considered to enhance the fees. In reversing the lower court decision, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />We have stated in previous cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary circumstances, and we reaffirm that rule. But as we have also said in prior cases, there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified. Because the District Court did not apply these standards, we reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Stephen Breyer filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Breyer would not have reached the question of whether the fees were appropriately calculated in this case. Had he reached that question, he would have upheld the lower court&#39;s decision.<br /><br />The lodestar calculation is used by courts in awarding attorney&#39;s fees and is the product of reasonable hours worked and a reasonable hourly rate. The class action suit was filed on behalf of 3,000 children in the Georgia foster care system. After reaching a settlement, plaintiffs requested more than $14 million in attorney&#39;s fees. Half that amount was based on the lodestar, and the other half was an enhancement for superior work and results.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">war crimes court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?id=1627&jezik=e">convicted</a> [press release] Radomir Vukovic and Zoran Tomic for their alleged roles in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> during the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. The accused were found guilty of genocide under Article 171 paragraph a) of the <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/criminal-code-of-bih.pdf">BiH criminal code</a> [text, PDF] and were each sentenced to 31 years imprisonment. As members of the 2nd Sekovici Special Police Detachment, the court found that Vukovic and Tomic participated in capturing Bosniak men from the UN safe area and in securing a road to allow the transfer of Bosniak women, children, and elderly. The court also held that the accused knowingly aided in the event in which 1,000 Bosniak men were imprisoned in a warehouse and then executed by Serb police firing automatic weapons and throwing hand grenades. Vukovic participated by throwing hand grenades and Tomic fired an automatic rifle at the captured men. The court extended custody of the accused for up to nine months or until the court issues a new decision.<br /><br />In March, the BiH <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">indicted Nedjo Ikonic</a> [JURIST report], a former Serb commander of a special police brigade, for his alleged role in the Srebrenica massacre. The BiH war crimes court was set up in 2005 to relieve the caseload of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], and is authorized to try lower-level war crime suspects. The court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bosnia-war-crimes-court-hands-down.php">delivered its first sentences</a> [JURIST report] against war crimes suspects from Yugoslavia&#39;s violent ethnic conflicts of the 1990s in July 2008, convicting seven of genocide for their involvement in killings committed at the Srebrenica prison camp. The ICTY retains jurisdiction over high-level war crimes allegations, such as those against Bosnian Serb wartime leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/703/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] and General <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials].

Frommert</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-racial.php">report</a>] that a district court has an obligation to defer to an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [text] plan administrator&#39;s reasonable interpretation of the terms of the plan if the plan administrator arrived at the interpretation outside the context of an administrative claim for benefits. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/10e20ac8-a1dd-4158-badc-be7d2091d922/1/doc/07-0418-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/10e20ac8-a1dd-4158-badc-be7d2091d922/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a district court is under no obligation to defer to an ERISA plan administrator&#39;s interpretation and that a district court has &quot;allowable discretion&quot; to adopt any &quot;reasonable&quot; interpretation of the terms of the plan. In reversing the opinion below, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />We held in Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch that an ERISA plan administrator with discretionary authority to interpret a plan is entitled to deference in exercising that discretion. The question here is whether a single honest mistake in plan interpretation justifies stripping the administrator of that deference for subsequent related interpretations of the plan. We hold that it does not.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the consideration of the case.<br /><br />The case was brought by former <a href="http://www.xerox.com/?CMP=KNC-CORPUS&HBX_PK=Xerox&HBX_OU=50">Xerox</a> [corporate website] employees who left the company in the 1980s and were later rehired. The employees challenged the method used to calculate their retirement benefits. The district court deferred to the method used by the plan administrator, but the Second Circuit reversed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Eleven Philippines policemen and militia members pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder charges for their involvement in the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">November 2009 massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] that left 57 dead. The <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/253955/we-re-not-guilty">arraignment</a> [<em>Manila Bulletin</em> report] was held in Camp Bagong Diwa, which is also the headquarters of the <a href="http://metromanilapolice.org/">National Capital Region Police Office</a> (NCRPO) [official website]. The arraignment of four additional suspects was delayed until April 30 after a last minute motion was filed by their counsel. The decision to defer was made despite objections from the prosecution that the motion was a deliberate attempt to delay the proceedings. Several family members of the victims attended the arraignment. The family members had filed a manifestation with the court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/21/AR2010042100507.html">asking that the proceedings be delayed</a> [Reuters report] until after upcoming elections, as they fear justice can not be served under current <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website]. The court acknowledged the manifestation but still proceeded. The timing of the arraignment, as well as the pending trials of several other key suspects, has increased the concern over potential violence surrounding the May elections. <br /><br />The arraignment comes just days after prosecutors <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/apr/21/philippines-drops-charges-vs-2-massacre-suspects/">dropped charges</a>[AP report] against two massacre suspects, causing accusations of political interference. Last month, a Quezon City <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-clan-leader-cleared-of.php">court dismissed</a> [JURIST report] rebellion charges against 24 people, including Andal Ampatuan Sr., the leader of a Muslim clan in the Philippines&#39; semi-autonomous southern province of Maguindanao, and four of his family members. The Ampatuans and several of their followers are alleged to have intercepted Esmael Mangudadatu&#39;s convoy en route to declare his candidacy for governor at a regional election office, ultimately forcing his convoy to a remote hilltop where the Ampatuans&#39; group killed and buried them. In order to prove their cases against the large number of accused, the prosecution will have to rely <a href="/hotline/2010/02/prosecutors-cant-depend-on-positive.php">heavily on oral testimonies</a> [JURIST op-ed] that can often prove to be problematic. Following the killings, Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended habeas corpus in Maguindanao. She later <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-lifts-martial-law.php">lifted the conditions</a>, following <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/rights-group-urges-philippines.php">international pressure</a> [JURIST reports] and domestic legal challenges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US government official said Wednesday that at least five accused <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia+pirate">Somali pirates</a> [JURIST news archive] will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ikox2w8uO1e80g1mndtiJU16gobQD9F7M1B00">face charges in the US</a> [AP report], according to the Associated Press. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity while the transfers are pending, said that the accused will arrive in Norfolk, Virginia, by the end of this week. Although Kenyan courts are <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer willing to prosecute</a> [JURIST report] piracy cases, the source claims that not all 21 of those recently arrested in piracy incidents will face charges in the US. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] spokesperson Philip Crowley <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2010/4/140649.htm">told reporters</a> [daily press briefing] Wednesday, &quot;I would not deny that we have plans to bring pirates who are responsible for attacks against our vessels back to the United States.&quot; Crowley added that, &quot;Kenya is reaching a capacity problem &#8211; challenge. So this is where all countries have to step up just as we are doing and take responsibility for pirates who have attacked their ships and prosecute them to the fullest extent of national law.&quot;<br /><br />In January, the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] reported that 2009 marked the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">worst year for maritime piracy</a> [JURIST report] in six years. The information indicated that the total reported incidents of piracy reached 406, surpassing 400 for the first time since 2003. Earlier that month, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-prosecutors-charge-suspected-somali.php">filed a superseding indictment</a> [JURIST report] against alleged Somali pirate Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse, claiming that he led the takeover of two additional ships. Muse pleaded not guilty to the charges. In November, Somali judge Mohamed Abdi Aware, known for jailing suspected pirates, human traffickers, and Islamist insurgents, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] while leaving a mosque in the Puntland city of Bossaso.

		<title>Sarkozy to introduce legislation banning full veils in public</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson for French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">BBC profile</a>] said Wednesday that the president is in favor of a complete public ban on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqa</a> [JURIST news archive] and other full face veils and will be submitting a bill to parliament in May. According to spokesperson Luc Chatel, Sarkozy wants the ban to be carried out in a way that doesn&#39;t stigmatize individuals for their religious beliefs and practices, but he feels that the veils are oppressive and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63K2BA20100421">harm female dignity</a> [Reuters report]. In addition to the bill, parliament will also be discussing a separate resolution on May 11, which will discuss ways of limiting the use of full veils. The issue has sparked debate with feminists supporting the ban because it prevents women from being forced into wearing the veils, and others questioning the proposed ban&#39;s constitutionality.  France houses the largest Muslim population in the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official website] with Muslims comprising about 10 percent of the total French population.<br /><br />Last month, the French Council of State <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-council-advises-against-full.php">advised the French government against a complete ban</a> [JURIST report] on full Islamic veils because it risks violating the French Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. France already has a partial ban that prevents public officials from wearing veils while operating in their official capacity and also prohibits veils in public schools. Critics of the ban say the law would <a href="/hotline/2010/02/proposed-french-ban-on-burqas-alienates.php">alienate France&#39;s Muslim minority</a> [JURIST comment] and violate the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/b3ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], of which France is a signatory. Last month, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/785036--quebec-niqab-bill-makes-women-unveil-to-get-public-services">lawmakers in Quebec introduced a bill</a> [<em>Star</em> report] that would ban women from wearing full face veils from public services, which garnered support from members of the Muslim Canadian Congress who argue that the law would <a href="/hotline/2010/02/canada-should-consider-burka-ban-as.php">not violate human rights</a> [JURIST comment] and would promote the ideals of a free and democratic society. Also last month, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/belgium-parliamentary-committee-votes.php">Belgian parliamentary committee voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to completely ban the wearing of full veils in public. If approved, Belgium will be the first European nation to impose a nationwide restriction on traditional face-covering veils.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Sri Lankan army chief <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8356676.stm">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fonseka">news archive</a>] appeared before <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/">parliament</a> [official website] Thursday to call for both his freedom and respect for the &quot;rule of law.&quot; Fonseka argued for his release from what he characterized as an <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/04/201042241957232658.html">&quot;illegal detention&quot;</a> [Al Jazeera report] and a byproduct of injustice, while also insisting on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8636478.stm">democratic improvements</a> [BBC report] and institution of the &quot;rule of law.&quot; He was temporarily released from military custody in order to attend the session, to which he traveled under guard. Fonseka faces two separate court-martials, charging him with participating in politics while in uniform and with improperly awarding army procurement contracts, but he successfully won a seat in parliament in elections held earlier this month. He maintains that the allegations are politically motivated. Fonseka is scheduled for a hearing before the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on April 26, where he will challenge his detention.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Fonseka&#39;s trials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sri-lanka-ex-army-chief-court-martials.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] to allow the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20COURT%20OF%20APPEAL%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Court of Appeals</a> [official website] to examine the legality of court-martials. Fonseka was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/sri-lanka-military-police-arrest.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by the military in February after losing presidential elections held the previous month. In March, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/sri-lanka-ex-chief-justice-criticizes.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the government&#39;s treatment of the general. Sarath Nanda Silva, who retired from the Sri Lankan Supreme Court last year, accused the government of using the military justice system to prevent Fonseka from participating in the upcoming elections, and of violating Fonseka&#39;s civil rights. Silva also said that Fonseka&#39;s arrest was made in violation of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Introduction.htm">constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kyrgyzstan interim deputy leader Omurbek Tekebayev announced Thursday that the country would hold a referendum on a new constitution on July 27. Tekebayev, part of the interim government that took power two weeks ago amid an <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">anti-government uprising</a> [JURIST report], said the new constitution <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i_SY3pvL01eZ1hk32a-dcy4vI2eg">would guarantee</a> [AFP report] a parliamentary republic and reduce the powers of the president in order to prevent authoritarianism. He said the new constitution will also try to prevent powerful parliamentary majorities by limiting any political party to only 50 seats out of a 90-seat parliament. The country&#39;s last parliament was controlled by the ousted president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev&#39;s</a> [BBC profile] Ak-Zhol party. Tekebayev also announced that elections in the country will be held on October 10.<br /><br />On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into_21.phpe">urged</a> [JURIST report] Kyrgyzstan&#39;s interim government to begin a comprehensive investigation into the violence between April 6 and 8 that resulted in the overthrow of president Bakiyev. Kyrgyz interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span> profile] said last week that Bakiyev should <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for the recent violence. Despite the pledge to bring Bakiyev and his allies to justice, so far only former defense minister Baktybek Kaliyev has been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl9bo4DfKFLUi5Ciy_d6bAOU8Vdg">arrested</a> [AFP report]. The protests, prompted in part by a drastic increase in utility costs, led to at <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63D0YG20100414">least 84 deaths</a> [Reuters report] and many more injuries. Earlier this month, Otunbayeva <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">launched the interim government</a> [JURIST report] after the violence forced Bakiyev to flee the capital.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Thursday that it will appeal last week&#39;s <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/assets/pdf/FFRF_v_Obama_Order.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-rules-national-day-of.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.ndptf.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> [official website] is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. The DOJ <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703876404575200441140766602.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_news">filed a notice of appeal</a> [WSJ report] Thursday with the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], where last week Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that the day of prayer violates the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] because it is more than &quot;acknowledgment&quot; of religion, but rather government-backed encouragement that Americans engage in non-secular activity. Crabb granted summary judgment for the <a href="http://www.ffrf.org/">Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website], but the White House has said that President Barack Obama still intends to recognize the day of prayer on May 6.<br /><br />Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a teacher-led <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ninth-circuit-upholds-pledge-of.php">recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance</a> [JURIST report] in public schools does not violate the Constitution&#39;s Establishment Clause. The court also upheld the use of the phrase &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on currency. In November, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a school district&#39;s policy prohibiting the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-upholds-school-ban-on.php">performance of religious holiday songs</a> [JURIST report] does not violate the Establishment Clause. Also that month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">license plates</a> [JURIST report] produced by the state bearing a picture of a cross in front of a stained glass window and the words &quot;I Believe&quot; violate the Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Navy judge in Iraq acquitted US <a href="http://www.sealchallenge.navy.mil/">Navy SEAL</a> [official website] Jonathan Keefe Friday of a charge of dereliction of duty in relation to the alleged assault of a high-profile Iraqi detainee implicated in the killing of four American contractors in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fallujah">Fallujah</a> [JURIST new archive] in 2004, citing <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gz7Vp4WQ6rlbznaqmlZHlbtxrs0gD9F8UATG0">insufficient evidence</a> [AP report]. Testimony at the hearing included that of recently acquitted fellow Navy SEAL Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas, which directly conflicted with testimony from Iraqi prisoner Ahmed Hashim Abed. Petty Officer 2nd Class Keefe and Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe had been charged with dereliction for allegedly failing to take action while Huertas beat Abed. McCabe is awaiting his military trial, scheduled for May 3 in Norfolk, Virginia.<br /><br />A US military panel in Iraq on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-navy-seal-acquitted-of-iraqi.php">acquitted Huertas</a> [JURIST report] of any wrongdoing in connection with the alleged assault of Abed, an Iraqi detainee suspected of organizing an incident that resulted in the deaths of four military contractors in Fallujah. A US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/navy-seals-accused-of-assaulting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that Huertas&#39;s court-martial would be held at <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/abu_ghurayb-cc.htm">Camp Victory</a> [GlobalSecurity Backgrounder] in Baghdad, Iraq, so that Abed could testify against him. Detainee abuse has been a major issue during the Iraq war, and the case against the three Navy SEALS has been seen as an attempt to compensate for other abuses like those at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abu+ghraib">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive].

Late last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/19/european-union-protest-sanctions-against-judge-garz-n">statement</a> [press release] that sanctions against Garzon &quot;risk undermining the EU&#8217;s collective credibility and effectiveness in seeking justice for current human rights crimes.&quot; Garzon is also facing charges of bribery over money he received for seminars conducted in the United States.<br /><br />In March, the Spanish <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201004/07/espana/20100407elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">charged</a> [order, PDF; in Spanish] Garzon with abuse of power based on Garzon&#39;s 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordered exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain.

		<title>Proposal to legalize limited commercial whaling unveiled</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://iwcoffice.org/">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) [official website] unveiled a <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC62docs/62-7.pdf">draft proposal</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/IWC62docs/press%20release%2022-04-10.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] Thursday that would make limited commercial whaling legal for the first time in 25 years. The proposal reflects a compromise for the countries that engage in whaling despite international law against it. Japan, Norway, and Iceland would be allowed to continue under strict quotas meant to reduce whaling to sustainable levels over time. Japan, which defends its illegal whaling by claiming an exemption for scientific purposes, will have its self-imposed quota for minke whales <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5isOtQ1a3c_D4mxCabXr8Q66YAcEAD9F8KUF00">reduced</a> [AP report] from 935 to 400 for the 2010 season and down to 200 by 2015. The hunting of humpback whales in the Southern Hemisphere is still prohibited, but the proposal allows for a limited number in the North Atlantic. The proposal addresses the fact that the overall ban on whaling has been ineffective:<br /><blockquote><br />The <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">status quo</span> is not an option for an effective multilateral organisation. To overcome the present impasse, the IWC has in recent years recognised the need to create a non-confrontational environment within which issues of fundamental difference amongst members can be discussed with a view to their resolution. Reconciliation of differences in views about whales and whaling will strengthen actions related to the common goal of maintaining healthy whale populations and maximizing the likelihood of the recovery of depleted populations.<br /></blockquote><br />Despite this goal, the IWC has received <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/press/releases/endangered-whales-to-be-hunted">criticism</a> [press release] from the anti-whaling group <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/">Greenpeace</a> [official website]. The IWC will discuss the proposal during its June meeting in Morocco.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling">Whaling</a> [Greenpeace backgrounder] is regulated by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/convention.pdf">1946 Whaling Convention</a> [text, PDF], and commercial whaling was outright banned in 1986 by the IWC. The Japanese whalers <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1686486,00.html">defend</a> [TIME report] their whaling as scientific research because they collect data on the whale&#39;s age, diet, and birthing rate, before packaging and selling the meat. The Japanese mostly hunt for minke and finback whales, but have begun to hunt humpback whales, which have reached sustainable levels since being placed on the endangered species list in 1963. Earlier this month, Japanese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/japan-authorities-indict-new-zealand.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] New Zealand anti-whaling activist, Pete Bethune, with five criminal charges in connection with boarding a Japanese whaling vessel as part of an anti-whaling protest in the antarctic seas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/">Senator Lindsay Graham</a> (R-SC) [official website] withdrew support for a comprehensive climate change bill on Saturday, delaying the unveiling of the legislation and casting its prospects for passage into doubt. The bill represents a major part of President Barack Obama&#39;s legislative agenda and had been <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/politics/sns-ap-us-climate-bill-congress,0,4950187.story">under negotiation</a> [AP report] between Graham and Senators <a href="http://kerry.senate.gov/">John Kerry</a> (D-MA) and <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joseph Lieberman</a> (I-CT) [official websites] for six months. The proposed legislation was to be unveiled Monday, but was postponed by Kerry after learning of Graham&#39;s decision. In a <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/36302.html">letter</a> [text], Graham, the only Republican Senator that has agreed to work with the Obama administration on the bill, criticized the Democratic leadership for the reported plan to move forward with <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration reform</a> [JURIST news archive] legislation before the climate bill. Graham described the move as motivated by partisan politics, saying: <blockquote>I was greatly looking forward to the opportunity to address [energy independence] on the floor of the U.S. Senate as we pushed [this] legislation forward into law. But it appears President Obama and the Senate Democratic leadership have other more partisan, political objectives in mind. Moving forward on immigration &#8212; in this hurried, panicked manner &#8212; is nothing more than a cynical political ploy. I know from my own personal experience the tremendous amounts of time, energy, and effort that must be devoted to this issue to make even limited progress. In 2007, we spent hundreds of hours over many months ... searching for a way to address our nation&#8217;s immigration problems. Expecting these major issues to be addressed in three weeks &#8212; which appears to be their current plan based upon media reports &#8212; is ridiculous. It also demonstrates the raw political calculations at work here.</blockquote> In responding to Graham&#39;s announcement, Kerry said that he would be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/us/politics/25graham.html?hpw">willing to return</a> [NYT report] to negotiations whenever Graham was, but was unsure of when that would be. Senate <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Majority Leader Harry Reid</a> (D-NV) [official website] stated his commitment to passage of both the climate bill and immigration reform legislation before the November midterm elections and the end of the current session of Congress.<br /><br />The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/house-passes-climate-bill-as-obama.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] their version of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2454:">climate bill</a> [HR 2454 materials] in June on a narrow 219-212 vote. The bill calls for a reduction in greenhouse emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and by 80 percent by 2050 by establishing a cap-and-trade system. The bill establishes first-time limits on greenhouse gases that will become progressively stricter. Immigration reform constitutes another plank of Obama&#39;s legislative agenda. Graham and <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/">Senator Charles Schumer</a> (D-NY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-senators-unveil-bipartisan.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] their proposal for comprehensive immigration reform in March. The plan entails improving border security, creating a system through which temporary workers would be admitted, introducing biometric identification cards, and instituting a process to legalize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive] currently residing within the US. The proposed bill is also the first attempt at immigration reform since the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-senate-rejects-immigration-reform.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN1639:">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill</a> [S 1639 materials] in 2007. At that time, detractors called the bill too lenient on illegal immigrants and said that by granting legal status to illegal aliens, the US was granting &quot;amnesty.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Thursday called for <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-wall-street-reform">new financial regulations</a> [text], outlining the major components of his proposal. Answering critics who claim that the reforms will increase bailouts, Obama compared the concept behind the proposed financial reforms to the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC)[official website], a government program he says protects confidence in the banking system and protects consumers while eliminating the need for ad hoc bailouts when banks become insolvent. According to Obama, the reform will contain four central elements: the Volcker Rule to limit the size of banks and the risks allowable, transparency to expose the underlying risk in complex financial instruments, consumer protections to combat predatory lending, and increases in shareholder power to give investors input on executive salaries and bonuses. Obama argued that new financial reforms are vital to the future of the US economy:<br /><blockquote><br />In the end, our system only works - our markets are only free - when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check excesses, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the rules than to game the system. And that is what the reforms we&#39;ve been proposing are designed to achieve - no more, no less.<br /></blockquote><br />Republican lawmakers, including House minority leader <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) have <a href="http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article.aspx?id=530936">voiced opposition</a> [IBD op-ed] to Obama&#39;s plan.<br /><br />Democrats on the Senate <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Banking Committee</a> [official website] on Monday introduced the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/ChairmansMark31510AYO10306_xmlFinancialReformLegislationBill.pdf">Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF], aimed at increasing financial regulation in the wake of the recent financial crisis. This bill is the second financial reform bill to be proposed by the Senate Banking Committee following the 2008 financial crisis. The <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf">2009 bill</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senate-banking-chair-introduces-wide.php">report</a>] was met with resistance and resulted in the committee&#39;s development of the new bill. In December, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/house-approves-bill-to-create-consumer.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report]. The US <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/house-committee-approves-consumer.php">approved a bill</a> to create a consumer financial protection agency in October, after originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/house-committee-delays-consumer.php">delaying</a> [JURIST reports] it at the behest of financial industry leaders in July. The creation of the agency is a key step in achieving the Obama administration&#39;s stated goal of tightening financial industry regulations. In June, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system.

		<title>Oregon jury orders Boy Scouts to pay $18.5 million in punitive damages for abuse</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Oregon jury Friday found the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts of America</a> [organization website] negligent for failing to take actions that would have prevented further sexual abuse by an assistant scoutmaster during the 1980s and ordered the organization to pay $18.5 million in punitive damages to plaintiff Kerry Lewis. <a href="http://courts.oregon.gov/Multnomah/index.page?">Multnomah County Circuit Court</a> [official website] jurors concluded that awarding punitive damages was appropriate considering that the Boy Scouts acted in a recklessly indifferent manner in failing to protect child scouts from suspected pedophiles, particularly when the alleged molester had already confessed to molesting 17 children. Jurors were allowed access to highly restricted files known as &quot;perversion files&quot; that the Boy Scouts keep on suspected pedophiles after a judge <a href="http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Boy-Scouts-release-perversion-files-in-sex-abuse-suit-88724552.html">ordered</a> [AP report] their release in March. The Lewis case is only the second instance in which a court has ordered the release of the files. The Boy Scouts say they will <a href="http://news.opb.org/article/7141-scouts-will-appeal-verdict-abuse-trial/">appeal</a> [OPB report] the verdict.<br /><br />Last week, the Oregon jury <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303695604575182163691325690.html">awarded $1.4 million</a> [WSJ report] to Lewis in damages for pain and suffering, finding that Boy Scouts of America National Council was 60 percent responsible for the abuse and allocating 15 percent of the liability to the local <a href="http://www.cpcbsa.org/">Cascade Pacific Council</a> [organization website] and 25 percent to the local sponsoring congregation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Mormon congregation reached a settlement with Lewis prior to the verdict. Most sexual abuse claims against the Boy Scouts of America are settled out of court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Fatullayev&sessionid=51959627&skin=hudoc-en">ordered</a> [judgment text; <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=866871&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">press release</a>] Azerbaijan&#39;s government to &quot;secure the immediate release&quot; of imprisoned Azeri journalist Eynulla Fatuallyev and pay him over 25,000 euros in compensation. Fatuallyev has been imprisoned since April 2007 and was convicted in Azerbaijan of committing defamation and tax evasion and inciting terror and religious and ethnic hatred. International organizations, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/azerbaijan-urged-release-dissenting-journalist-2010-04-22">Amnesty International</a> (AI), the <a href="http://cpj.org/awards/2009/eynulla-fatullayev-editor-realny-azerbaijan.php">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ), the <a href="http://www.freemedia.at/justicedenied/azer.htm">International Press Institute</a> and <a href="http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&id_article=36871">Reporters Without Borders</a> [statements], have insisted that the charges against Fatullayev are spurious. The ECHR ruled that Fatullayev&#39;s conviction and 8.5 year prison sentence contravene Article 10, Freedom of Speech and Information, and Article 6, Right to a Fair Trial, of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Azerbaijan&#39;s Representative to the European Rights Court Chingiz Asgarov said, however, that the court&#39;s directive to release Fatuallyev is <a href="http://az.trend.az/news/society/rights/1674425.html">outside the purview</a> [Trend interview, in Azeri] of both the European Convention on Human Rights and Azerbaijan&#39;s legislation. Azerbaijan is planning to request that the <a href="http://az.apa.az/xeber_Prezident_Administrasiyasinin_shobe_mudiri:__184965.html">Grand Chamber review the decision</a> [APA interview, in Azeri], according to Azerbaijan Presidential Administration Law Enforcement Department Chief Fuad Alesgarov. At the end of last year, <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Jailed_Azerbaijani_Journalist_Faces_Drug_Charge__/1917870.html">heroin was allegedly found</a> [RFE/RL report] in Fatuallyev&#39;s prison cell, and he is currently on trial for possession of drugs - charges that many feel are <a href="http://cpj.org/2009/12/azerbaijan-trumps-up-new-charge-against-fatullayev.php">intended to prolong</a> [CPJ statement] the journalist&#39;s detention despite the ECHR decision in his favor. <br /><br />In 2009, Fatuallyev received, <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span>, one of CPJ&#39;s prestigious <a href="http://cpj.org/awards/2009/ipfa-2009-awardees.php">International Press Freedom Awards</a> [press release; <a href="http://cpj.org/awards/2009/fatullayev-tissainayagam-ipfa-2009-video.php">video</a>]. In the same year, he also received AI&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8079706.stm">Award for Journalism Under Threat</a> [BBC report]. Fatuallyev, who was editor-in-chief of <span style="font-style:italic;">Realny Azerbaijan</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gundalik Azerbaijan</span> newspapers until his imprisonment, formerly worked with well-known Azeri journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315439.stm">Elmar Huseynov</a> [BBC backgrounder] on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Monitor</span> magazine until Huseynov was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4313363.stm">murdered</a> [BBC report] in 2005. CPJ reported recently that Fatuallyev&#39;s imprisonment could be related to his <a href="http://cpj.org/reports/2008/09/azerbaijan-elmar.php">attempts to solve</a> [report] his colleague&#39;s murder. Azerbaijan&#39;s incumbent president Ilham Aliyev has been accused by members of the press of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/trial-begins-for-azerbaijan-journalists.php">heavy-handed repression of the media</a> [JURIST report]. The ECHR&#39;s ruling on Fatullayev&#39;s case is one of several decisions that the court has issued against Azerbaijan this month. The court also recently found that the country <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/europe-rights-court-rules-azerbaijan.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] a parliamentary candidate&#39;s right to free and fair elections during the 2005 elections.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4107270.stm">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahmadinejad">news archive</a>]  on Saturday strongly criticized new attempts to impose UN sanctions on his country&#39;s nuclear program. Ahmadinejad was in Uganda meeting with President Yoweri Museveni when he made the comments.  The Iranian leader said that actions being taken by the United States and its allies in the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] are illegal and that his country will not accept any pressure. He also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gN6FzZsfkJI8Y6_uGjZ2rsLBbfiAD9F9MEF80">said</a> [AP report] that any evidence submitted by the United States and Britain for new UN sanctions amounted to &quot;lies&quot; similar to the claims made over nuclear weapons in Iraq which served as an impetus to the 2003 war. The UN Security Council has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7592063/Major-powers-resume-Iran-sanctions-talk-as-Ahmadinejad-threatens-US.html">resumed</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] meetings over a fourth round of sanctions against Iran, but the United States has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63L5P720100422">indicated</a> [Reuters report] it will impose unilateral sanctions if UN sanctions are not finalized by May.<br /><br />In September, Ahmadinejad <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-leader-denies-violation-of-nuclear.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] that Iran had broken nuclear development regulations in respect to a newly-disclosed nuclear facility. The statement followed a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/25/AR2009092502720.html?hpid=topnews">press conference</a> [WP report] where US, British, French, and German leaders gathered for the G-20 summit said in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Statements-By-President-Obama-French-President-Sarkozy-And-British-Prime-Minister-Brown-On-Iranian-Nuclear-Facility/">joint statement</a> [press release] that Iran had violated the terms of agreements with the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA)[official website] by failing to disclose in a timely manner the existence of a nuclear facility. Under the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2003/gov2003-40.pdf">terms</a> [IAEA board report, PDF] of a <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/1997/infcirc540c.pdf">2003 protocol</a> [text, PDF] to Iran&#39;s original IAEA <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc214.pdf">Safeguards Agreement</a> [text, PDF], Iran was obligated to disclose the existence of the plant prior to construction. In December 2006 the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-security-council-imposes-nuclear.php">imposed sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium and <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/security-council-broadens-iran-nuclear.php">broadened them</a> [JURIST report] three months later. The UN had previously ordered Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/breaking-news-un-security-council.php">stop expanding</a> [JURIST report] its nuclear program by August 31, 2006. Iran has said it will <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-threatens-iaea-withdrawal-if.php">completely withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the IAEA if its &quot;nuclear rights&quot; are taken away.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military appeals court on Thursday <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/courts/documents/archive/2010/HUTCHINS,%20L.G.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the conviction of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial. In an 8-1 decision, the <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/nmcca.htm">Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] ruled that the departure of one of Hutchins&#39;s primary attorneys shortly before the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=court-martial">court-martial</a> [JURIST news archive] began resulted in an unfair trial.  The ruling makes it possible that Hutchins <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MARINES_IRAQ_SHOOTING?SITE=NYMID&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">may be restored</a> [AP report] to his prior rank, which was reduced to private following his conviction. The <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/">Navy JAG Corps</a> [official website] may appeal the decision within 30 days.<br /><br />Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, reduced from <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad in <a href="http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforcent/Pages/LOAC/HamdaniaInvestigations.aspx">Hamdania</a> [USMC materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdania">news archive</a>]. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-convicted-of-murdering-iraqi.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, making a false official statement, and larceny. Six Marines <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/sixth-us-serviceman-enters-guilty-plea.php">pled guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges related to their roles in the incident, which involved Awad being removed from his residence and killed, then arranged with a shovel and firearm to appear as if he were planting an improvised explosive device.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two Latino advocacy groups say they plan to challenge the constitutionality of Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, alleging it permits racial profiling. <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">SB 1070</a> [text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] Friday by Governor Jan Brewer, permits police to question the immigration status of suspected illegal immigrants. Officials from the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website; <a href="http://maldef.org/news/releases/maldef_condemns_az_governor_042310/">press release</a>] and the <a href="http://www.conlamic.org/">National Coalition of Latino Christian Clergy</a> [advocacy website] contend the law will let police single out minorities for immigration inspections. Under the law, it is designated a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F9G7TG0">crime</a> [AP report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">report</a>] to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500. MALDEF said the law creates a separate state scheme to enforce immigration violations:<br /><blockquote><br />One significant measure of SB 1070&#39;s patent illegality is that it seeks to implement Arizona&#8217;s own scheme of immigration regulation &#8211; separate and in conflict with federal government policy &#8211; when our Constitution envisions a unified nation under one federal set of immigration regulations to be adopted by Congress and implemented by the President. By rejecting that constitutional plan, Arizona&#8217;s enactment of SB 1070 is tantamount to a declaration of secession. In response, the federal government must act to preserve our united nation by clearly stating that it will not cooperate in any way with the implementation of SB 1070 &#8211; that it will not adjust or alter its immigration enforcement priorities to the detriment of other states simply to accommodate Arizona&#39;s most recent exercise in racial demagoguery.<br /></blockquote><br />Brewer says she will <a href="http://ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=1287687">instruct</a> [text of speech] the state&#39;s police departments to implement the law without violating civil rights. <br /><br />The Arizona law is one of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-senate-approves-strict-illegal.php">strictest</a> [JURIST report] illegal immigration laws in the nation. Proponents of the bill <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63I6TU20100419">claim</a> [Reuters report] the new law will decrease illegal immigration from Mexico. After the Arizona House approved the bill, US senators <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorMcCain.Biography">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and <a href="http://kyl.senate.gov/constit_center/about.cfm">Jon Kyl</a> (R-AZ) [official profiles] announced their support for the measure and <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=18572270-e566-c8a0-a4a0-9e34320ee6e6">outlined</a> [press release] a proposal for additional federal controls on illegal immigration along the Arizona-Mexico border. In 2008, Arizona voters narrowly <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/immigration-ballot-measures-defeated-in.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure that would have revoked the business licenses of employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_042310_StatementByGovernorOnSB1070.pdf">signed into law</a> [press release, PDF] a controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">bill</a> [SB1070 materials] that would require any individual suspected of being an illegal immigrant to present valid identification to law enforcement officials. The bill gives police officers permission to determine the immigration status of any individual who arouses reasonable suspicion, criminalizes the hiring of illegal immigrants for day labor, and allows citizens to sue the local government if they believe the policy is not being used properly. Brewer signed the bill despite <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/obama-criticizes-proposed-arizona.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] from US President Barack Obama earlier in the day that the measure, &quot;threaten[s] to undermine basic notions of fairness.&quot; The bill will take effect in 90 days.<br /><br />The bill was approved earlier this month by the Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-senate-approves-strict-illegal.php">Senate</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-house-approves-tough-new.php">House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this week, Brewer announced a new <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/04-22-10%20Governor%20Brewer%20Announces%20Border%20Security%20Plan.pdf">Arizona border security plan</a> [press release; AP <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F8HQC80">report</a>], and declared her support for a <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=1C51B23D-D4F6-A829-94F6-3EF0E67514E1">10-point plan</a> [press release] supported by US Senators <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorMcCain.Biography">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and  <a href="http://kyl.senate.gov/constit_center/about.cfm">Jon Kyl</a> (R-AZ) [official profiles].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Thursday expressed opposition to a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">pending Arizona bill</a> [SB 1070 materials] that would require any individual suspected of being an illegal immigrant to present valid identification to law enforcement officials. In <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-naturalization-ceremony-active-duty-service-members">remarks</a> [text] delivered at a naturalization ceremony, Obama stated that failure to enact federal immigration reform has given rise to laws such as the one under consideration in Arizona:<br /><blockquote><br />Indeed, our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others. And that includes, for example, the recent efforts in Arizona, which threatened to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.<br /></blockquote><br />Obama&#39;s stance on the Arizona law reflects his administration&#39;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration">policy</a> [official website] that aims &quot;to bring people out of the shadows.&quot; The remarks underscored <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/press/Senate/49leg/2R/DEMOCRATIC+STATEMENT+IMMIGRATION+201004.DOC.htm">Democratic opposition</a> [press release] to the bill in Arizona. Proponents argue, however, that the law will discourage illegal immigration.<br /><br />The Arizona Senate <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-senate-approves-strict-illegal.php">approved SB 1070</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Prior to the Senate approval, the Arizona House of Representatives also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-house-approves-tough-new.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the legislation. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/About_Gov.asp">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official profile] must decide whether to sign the bill within five days after the Senate passage. On Thursday, Brewer announced a new <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/04-22-10%20Governor%20Brewer%20Announces%20Border%20Security%20Plan.pdf">Arizona border security plan</a> [press release; AP <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F8HQC80">report</a>], and declared her support for a <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=1C51B23D-D4F6-A829-94F6-3EF0E67514E1">10-point plan</a> [press release] supported by US Senators <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=AboutSenatorMcCain.Biography">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) and  <a href="http://kyl.senate.gov/constit_center/about.cfm">Jon Kyl</a> (R-AZ) [official profiles].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the UK <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] announced Friday that the government will award compensation to Lotfi Raissi, an Algerian-born UK man wrongfully detained in the wake of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Raissi was jailed in September 2001 on a US extradition warrant after being indicted by a federal grand jury on accusations that he provided pilot training to 9/11 hijackers. In February 2008, the UK Appeals Court <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/72.html#para156">ordered</a> [judgment text] the Ministry to consider Raissi&#39;s appeal for compensation, reversing a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/uk-court-denies-compensation-for.php">2007 High Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that he was ineligible for compensation because his detention stemmed from an extradition order. The Appeals Court held that the issue of extradition is not relevant to the question of compensation so long as it still results in a miscarriage of justice by UK courts. Last month, the Appeals Court gave <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/straw.htm">Justice Secretary Jack Straw</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2010/337.html&query=lotfi+and+raissi&method=boolean">28 days</a> [judgment text] to decide whether to compensate Raissi. An independent assessor will now determine the amount of the award, which some expect to be several thousand pounds.<br /><br />Raissi was arrested naked in his home with his wife and brother on September 21, 2001. He was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1815000/1815903.stm">granted conditional bail</a> [BBC report] five months later because the US government was unable to adduce any evidence to support its allegations. He sought compensation under a government scheme allowing payment to any &quot;person whose convictions are quashed on appeal or who, following charge, have not been proceeded against or have been acquitted of crime at trial.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US federal prosecutors have <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/Pressreleases/04-AprilPDFArchive/10/20100423piratenr.html">charged</a> [press release] a group of 11 suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somali+pirates">Somali pirates</a> [JURIST news archive] in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], according to indictments unsealed Friday. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/index.html">District Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] filed separate charges against two different groups of suspected pirates.  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/hamptonroadscom/store/1561.pdf">Charges</a> [indictment, PDF] were filed against a group of six alleged pirates who were <a href="http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=52335">captured by the USS Nicholas</a> [Navy press release] in late March, and separate <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/hamptonroadscom/store/1571.pdf">charges</a> [indictment, PDF] were filed against the other five who were <a href="http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world/uss-ashland-captures-possible-pirates_100346417.html">captured by the USS Ashland</a> [Thaindian News report] earlier this month. The US government is prosecuting the suspects for conspiring to commit and committing <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gri4m_txREbeWdj3VZDVJwHiwErQD9F8S8E00">various offenses</a> [AP report], including piracy and attack with the intent to plunder a vessel, noting that &quot;the primary purpose of the conspiracy was to make money by means of piracy on the high seas.&quot; <br /><br />Earlier this week, a US government official said that at least five accused Somali pirates would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/at-least-five-suspected-somali-pirates.php">face charges in the US</a> [JURIST report]. In the beginning of April, Kenyan Foreign Minister Minister Moses Wetangula said that Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">will no longer accept Somalian pirate cases</a> [JURIST report] to be tried in its courts. In January, the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] reported that 2009 marked the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">worst year for maritime piracy</a> [JURIST report] in six years. The information indicated that the total reported incidents of piracy reached 406, surpassing 400 for the first time since 2003. In November, Somali judge Mohamed Abdi Aware, known for jailing suspected pirates, human traffickers, and Islamist insurgents, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] while leaving a mosque in the Puntland city of Bossaso.

Zarein Ahmedzay appeared before US magistrate judge <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/General_Information/Court_Phone_Book/Magistrate-Judges/SMG/smg.html">Steven Gold</a> [official profile] on charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass of destruction (explosive bombs) against persons or property in the US, conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country, and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The plot was never carried out after Ahmedzay and co-conspirator  <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/z/najibullah_zazi/index.html">Najibullah Zazi</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=zazi">news archive</a>] realized that law enforcement was investigating their activities.

As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped two charges against Ahmedzay. Zazi also <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-terrorism-suspect-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to terrorism charges, and faces up to life in prison in connection with those. Medunjanin has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-terrorism-suspect-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report].

Ocampo <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc860985.pdf">filed the request</a> [text, PDF] Monday for a finding of non-cooperation pursuant to Article 87 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/STATUTE/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] for the government&#39;s refusal to arrest Humanitarian Affairs Minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279813.PDF">Ahmed Harun</a> and Janjaweed militia leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279858.PDF">Ali Kushayb</a> [arrest warrants, PDF]. The request stated that Sudan has a binding legal obligation to fully cooperate with the court, as mandated by <a href="http://www.unsudanig.org/unsudan/data/res1593.pdf">UN Security Counsel Resolution 1593</a> [text, PDF], and has repeatedly refused to do so since the warrants were issued in 2007. The request went on to say &quot;[t]o the contrary, the [government of Sudan] continues to commit crimes, promotes and protects the persons sought by the Court; and harasses all persons who are considered to be in favor of justice.&quot; Sudan, which is not a permanent member of the ICC, refuses to recognize the court&#39;s jurisdiction, stating that &quot;the International Criminal Court has no place in this crisis at all.&quot; Harun and Kushayb are <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc%200205%200107/darfur_%20sudan?lan=en-GB">wanted for 51 counts</a> [case materials] of crimes against humanity and war crimes.<br /><br />Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] has also eluded a warrant issued last year for his arrest. Last month, the president of the ICC said that Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/al-bashir-will-face-justice-before-icc.php">will eventually face justice</a> [JURIST report] in The Hague. Speaking in London before the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/presidency/the%20president/judge%20sang_hyun%20song%20_republic%20of%20korea__%20president?lan=en-GB">Judge Sang-Hyun Song</a> [official profile] addressed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant&page=2">controversy</a> [JURIST news archive] surrounding the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] issued one year ago stating that &quot;judges cannot and will not take political considerations into account.&quot;Responding to questions, Song went on to compare the al-Bashir warrant with the successful surrender of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,3858,4637789-103684,00.html">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Guardian</font> obituary; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">Charles Taylor</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>] to the international criminal tribunals.

The $318,000 awarded against Dazhong Insurance is the <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6960022.html">largest amount of damages</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">People&#39;s Daily</span> report] ever ordered by a Chinese court in a software piracy suit. This was Microsoft&#39;s first major anti-piracy lawsuit in China, where last November a court ruled that Microsoft had <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-court-rules-against-microsoft-in.php">infringed on intellectual property</a> [JURIST report] of a Chinese company.<br /><br />Microsoft has been a party to many legal proceedings outside the US in recent years.

Last September, the Seoul Central District Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/south-korea-court-again-rules-against.php">found Microsoft in violation</a> [JURIST report] of South Korea&#39;s antitrust laws for bundling software programs with its Windows operating system. The court found the company&#39;s bundling practice to be in violation of fair competition rules and disruptive to the market. This was the second suit within a few months in which Microsoft was found liable for breach of South Korean antitrust laws. This was the second suit within a few months in which Microsoft was found liable for breach of South Korean antitrust laws. Last June, the same court ruled that Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/south-korea-court-rules-against.php">violated antitrust laws</a> [JURIST report] by packaging software with its Windows operating system, also dismissing requests for damages from two Korean software firms on the grounds that the damages were not sufficiently linked to Microsoft&#39;s conduct.

After an attack Sunday on a former premier&#39;s home left 11 people injured, the reds dug into their fortified bunker in Bangkok in anticipation of government retaliation. Yellow shirt representatives have said that if the government will not crack down on the reds, the group is prepared to take action itself.

<p>Last week, Thai <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">BBC profile</a>] announced that he is prepared to negotiate with red shirt protesters once they cease their illegal conduct. Thai courts have recently <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-issues-arrest-warrants.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for several high-profile protesters, including high-ranking officials of the red shirt opposition, in connection with violent protests and an alleged <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/35814/warrants-out-for-7-raiders">break-in at Parliament</a> [<i>Bangkok Post</i> report]. Internal divisions have been mounting steadily in Thailand since the 2006 <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ouster</a> [JURIST report] of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], whose progressive policies engendered the support of the poor rural class that largely constitutes the reds today. The yellows, primarily consisting of the urban middle-class, considered Shinawatra, and as well as the reds, disloyal to the monarchy. Because of the mounting violence, Abhisit has <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">imposed a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and neighboring provinces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The TRC report, issued last December, detailed crimes committed during Liberia&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmil/background.shtml">civil war</a> [UNMIL backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1043500.stm">backgrounder</a>], including the recruitment of child soldiers, the rape of women, as well as the death of more than 250,000 citizens. According to Tah, the committee reviewing the TRC report will be trying to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042501428.html">determine who committed the most serious atrocities</a> [Reuters report] so that prosecutions can proceed as quickly as possible. Some in Liberia are skeptical that the government will proceed with prosecutions based on the TRC report. One of the report&#39;s most controversial recommendations is a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/07/libera-truth-commission-recommends-30.php">proposed 30-year ban</a> [JURIST report] from holding office for those who supported the civil conflict, which could affect prominent leaders such as current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4395978.stm">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> [BBC profile]. Skeptics contend it is unlikely that Sirleaf would support some of the recommendations while ignoring those that would have a direct impact on her political future. Supporters of the TRC report contend that prosecutions are necessary to achieving justice but warn that the process would be drawn out and that it could take up to 10 years before the trials could be held.

<p>The TRC report also contained a list of &quot;Most Notorious Predators&quot; and a list of perpetrators of economic crimes, which includes the head of the legal association for the defense of former president <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/taylor.php">Charles Taylor</a> [JURIST news archive]. Taylor is currently <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">on trial</a> [case materials] before the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> [official website] sitting at The Hague. Taylor faces <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">11 counts</a> [indictment, PDF] of crimes against humanity, violations of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [materials], and other violations of international humanitarian law stemming from a &quot;campaign to terrorize the civilian population&quot; of <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Sierra+Leone">Sierra Leone</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Also on Monday, an IHEC review panel <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/26/ap/middleeast/main6432876.shtml">nullified</a> [AP report] the votes of 52 candidates for alleged ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder], including two candidates that had won seats in the Iraqi <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/">Council of Representatives</a> [official website], at least one of which coming from Iraqiya. The uncertainty over the election results has jeopardized the US plan for withdrawal of combat troops by August, and has prompted the Obama administration to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-intervenes-in-iraq-election-row-as-feared-militia-waits-in-wings-1954224.html">propose a coalition government</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Independent</span> report] between Maliki and Allawi, where each would hold the premiership for two years.

<p>The IHEC <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-election-commission-orders-baghdad.php">ordered a manual recount</a> [JURIST report] of the ballots in Baghdad last week, following fraud allegations. The election commissioner for the IHEC informed the public that the Baghdad recount <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/2010419105643872399.html">would begin immediately</a> [Al Jazeera report], citing manipulation in voting stations. The State of Law coalition <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-ruling-coalition-alleges-fraud-in.php">alleged fraud</a> [JURIST report] after a preliminary count showed the Iraqiya coalition held a slight lead.

The initial ban was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a> and was <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once. This came as a reversal of a previous decision, where it <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704259304575043102453136246.html">held</a> [WSJ report] that the candidates could stand in the coming elections, but would have to be cleared of the allegations against them before taking office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Alliot-Marie told reporters that France would <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=114188#axzz0mDWOjkWE">send legal experts</a> [AFP report] to Jordan to help strengthen its court system. Sunday&#39;s talks follow the <a href="http://www.petra.gov.jo/Artical.aspx?Lng=1&Section=1&Artical=105529">protocol</a> [Petra report] signed by France and Jordan last April to enhance the countries&#39; legal cooperation. The protocol provides for the exchange of current legal and judicial releases and research highlighting the countries&#39; judiciary, and underscores revisions of Jordan&#39;s current civil and criminal laws.

<p>Jordan has employed a series of legal reforms to address the concerns of many human rights groups. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Jordan to <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/05/jordan-urged-to-restore-rule-of-law-by.php">restore its rule of law</a> [JURIST report] by ending extrajudicial detentions of crime victims, personal enemies, and persons freed by the courts. Per the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18279.htm">1954 Crime Prevention Law</a> [DOS backgrounder], which is currently in effect, government officials have the power to order administrative detentions on mere suspicions of improper behavior rather than on the showing of evidence that a crime has been committed. HRW asserted that the formulation and application of Jordan&#39;s Crime Prevention Law violates international standards as well as Articles 7 and 8 of the <a href="http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/jordan/jorpolcon.htm">Jordan Constitution</a> [text], which states that &quot;Personal freedom shall be guaranteed,&quot; and that &quot;No person may be detained or imprisoned except in accordance with the provisions of the law.&quot; The HRW report alleges that Jordan officials frequently circumvent the judicial system under which potential defendants are afforded due process and also that the subjects of such extrajudicial detentions are often the victims of crimes rather than the perpetrators themselves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a decision released Friday, the chamber recalled its earlier determination that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not of the appropriate severity to continue the proceedings against Abu Garda and found that the prosecution&#39;s petition did not meet the requirements for an appeal. The prosecutor argued in the appeal that the court had applied a stricter <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F1E0AC1C-A3F3-4A3C-B9A7-B3E8B115E886/140164/Rules_of_procedure_and_Evidence_English.pdf">evidentiary standard</a> [Rules of Evidence, PDF] in the Pre-Trial Chamber than it should have employed. In denying the appeal, the ICC said:<blockquote>[N]either the Statute nor the Rules, contrary to the Prosecution&#39;s assertion, draws a distinction as to the way evidence shall be assessed before a Trial Chamber and a Pre-Trial Chamber. The free assessment of the evidence presented by a party is, pursuant to the Statute, a core component of the judicial activity both at the pre-trial stage of a case and at trial. ... In light of the above, the proposition put forward by the Prosecution, namely that the Chamber should have applied a different standard to the assessment of the evidence at the confirmation of the charges stage, is without any legal basis.</blockquote>In the event that the prosecution provides additional evidence, it may still seek the confirmation of the charges or petition the chamber to appeal the decision.

<p>The ICC <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/icc-drops-charges-against-sudan-rebel.php">declined to confirm charges</a> against Abu Garda in February, a ruling that came after a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/icc-begins-sudan-rebel-leader.php">preliminary hearing</a> [JURIST reports] in October, during which the prosecution alleged that Abu Garda controlled the <a href="http://www.sudanjem.com/">Justice and Equality Movement</a> [official website, in Arabic]. The charges against Abu Garda stem from a series of attacks in 2007 that resulted in the death of 12 African Union Mission in Sudan soldiers. Abu Garda <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/05/sudan-rebel-leader-appears-before-icc.php">first appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the ICC on the charges in May 2009, and is the first individual involved in the situation in Darfur to appear before the court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The theory for the case is built on intelligence that British security service <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/uk-home-page.html">MI5</a> [official website] and the London police had uncovered about the four suicide bombers prior to the attacks. Counsel for bereaved families argued that the UK government breached obligations to its citizens under Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], which provides for the right to life. MI5 and the <a href="http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Secretary</a> [official website] argued in response to the prosecution&#39;s arguments that the matter has already been investigated in the <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/intelligence.aspx">Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee</a> (ISC) [official website] and that the intelligence could undermine law enforcement efforts if made public. The hearing is scheduled to last for three days.

Tra Gyal, who writes under the pseudonym Zhogs Dung, was reportedly <a href="http://calamities.gaeatimes.com/2010/04/26/tibetan-writer-detained-after-signing-open-letter-critical-of-chinas-quake-efforts-18768/">arrested</a> [AP report] while working at the Nationalities Publishing House in the provincial capital Xining. Tra Gyal helped <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7108169.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797093">organize private donations</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> report] for those left homeless in the remote Yushu county, a Tibet Autonomous Prefecture, by asking Tibetans not to send donations through official channels but rather to travel to the county themselves to guarantee their donations reached those in need. It is unclear whether Tra Gyal&#39;s detention is related to his criticism of the earthquake relief efforts.

<p>In February, a Chinese court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/china-earthquake-activist-sentenced-to.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Tan Zuoren to five years in prison on subversion charges after he documented the lethal consequences of substandard construction in the Sichuan province&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2008/china_quake/default.stm">2008 earthquake</a> [BBC backgrounder], which left some 90,000 dead. A Chinese court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/11/china-human-rights-activist-huang-qi.php">sentenced another earthquake activist</a> [JURIST report], Huang Qi, to three years in prison in November on the charge of illegally holding state secrets. Huang was a critic of the Chinese government&#39;s handling of the 2008 disaster. After the quake, he posted articles online criticizing the government&#39;s response and talked to foreign media outlets about how some children&#39;s deaths were the result of poorly-built schools. Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/040/2009/en/9ede45c2-3943-4a5b-b75b-7ef68fb6d787/asa170402009en.html">issued a statement</a> [text] in July urging China to drop the charges against Huang and release him from custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 6-5 <i>en banc</i> ruling upholds a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/ninth-circuit-upholds-class.php">previous decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Ninth Circuit that the lawsuit could go to trial despite the large size of the class. The case was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contend that Wal-Mart&#39;s nationwide policies violate <a href="http://employment.findlaw.com/employment/employment-employee-discrimination-harassment/civil-rights-title-7.html">Title VII</a> [text] of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging that women employed by Wal-Mart are paid less than men in comparable positions and wait longer for management promotions than men, despite their higher performance ratings and seniority. In a <a href="http://walmartstores.com/pressroom/news/9804.aspx">statement</a> [text], Wal-Mart said that they are going to proceed by reviewing their options:
<blockquote>
We disagree with the decision of the sharply divided 6-5 court to uphold portions of the certification order, and are considering our options, including seeking review from the Supreme Court. It is important to remember the court did not address the merits of this case. The court reiterated, &quot;our findings relate only to class action procedural questions; we neither analyze nor reach the merits of Plaintiffs&#39; allegations of gender discrimination.&quot; The court further noted that the trial court &quot;has the discretion to modify or decertify the class.&quot;
</blockquote>
The certified class, which in 2001 was estimated to encompass more than 1.5 million women, includes all women employed by Wal-Mart nationwide at any time after December 26, 1998. 

<p>The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-grants-wal-mart-rehearing.php">granted an <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> rehearing</a> [JURIST report] to Wal-Mart last year. According to the order, a majority of the Ninth Circuit judges, excluding the three judges who <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/02/ninth-circuit-upholds-class.php">heard an earlier appeal</a> [JURIST report] in which class certification was upheld, voted in favor of an <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> hearing. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit originally ruled against Wal-Mart&#39;s appeal of the class certification in February 2007, then issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/10/0416688.pdf">new opinion</a> [text, PDF] in conjunction with its decision in December 2007.

Wal-Mart also objected to the size of the class certified, which it says would violate its due process rights. Wal-Mart argued that its stores operate independently and should be sued individually, while plaintiffs&#39; lawyers countered that individual lawsuits would be impractical. The district court also rejected Wal-Mart&#39;s claim that the class size was &quot;impractical on its face&quot; and approved a statistical formula for paying damages if discrimination is proven.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The recount of votes cast in Baghdad province during the March 7 <a href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/special/misc/iraqielections2010/">parliamentary elections</a> [CEIP backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/iraqelections.php">news archive</a>] will be delayed a week, according to an official on Monday. The <a href="http://www.ihec.iq/english/index.htm">Independent High Election Commission</a> (IHEC) [official website] will <a href="http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1056221&type=World">not begin the recount</a> [Reuters report] until the review panel ordering the recount defines more precisely what a recount entails. <a href="http://www.ayadallawi.com/">Iyad Allawi</a> [personal website, in Arabic; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/iraqelection2010/2010/03/2010329495420860.html">profile</a>], whose Iraqiya coalition garnered a slim two-seat lead over the <a href="http://qanoon337.org/en/">State of Law</a> [official website] coalition of incumbent <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic], threatened to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126263517">reject the recount</a> [NPR report] if it only includes Baghdad. Also on Monday, an IHEC review panel <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/26/ap/middleeast/main6432876.shtml">nullified</a> [AP report] the votes of 52 candidates for alleged ties to Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath Party</a> [BBC backgrounder], including two candidates that had won seats in the Iraqi <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/">Council of Representatives</a> [official website], at least one of which coming from Iraqiya. The uncertainty over the election results has jeopardized the US plan for withdrawal of combat troops by August, and has prompted the Obama administration to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-intervenes-in-iraq-election-row-as-feared-militia-waits-in-wings-1954224.html">propose a coalition government</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span> report] between Maliki and Allawi, where each would hold the premiership for two years.<br /><br />The IHEC <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-election-commission-orders-baghdad.php">ordered a manual recount</a> [JURIST report] of the ballots in Baghdad last week, following fraud allegations. The election commissioner for the IHEC informed the public that the Baghdad recount <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/04/2010419105643872399.html">would begin immediately</a> [Al Jazeera report], citing manipulation in voting stations. The State of Law coalition <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iraq-ruling-coalition-alleges-fraud-in.php">alleged fraud</a> [JURIST report] after a preliminary count showed the Iraqiya coalition held a slight lead. In February, an Iraqi <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-allows-28-banned.php">appeals panel ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 28 of the 500 candidates previously banned due to allegations of ties to the Baath Party could stand in the election. The initial ban was characterized by the Iraqi government as <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-government-denounces-ruling.php">illegal</a> and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-appeals-panel-reverses-ruling-on.php">reversed</a> [JURIST reports] when the panel acknowledged that it did not have to rule on all 500 candidates at once. This came as a reversal of a previous decision, where it <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704259304575043102453136246.html">held</a> [WSJ report] that the candidates could stand in the coming elections, but would have to be cleared of the allegations against them before taking office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc863095.pdf">rejected</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/A46503CD-6CDB-4190-8265-4656D64F133D.htm">press release</a>] the prosecutor&#39;s petition to appeal the court&#39;s February  <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc819602.pdf">decision</a> [judgment, PDF] declining to confirm the charges against Darfur rebel chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050209/icc02050209">Bahr Idriss Abu Garda</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abu+garda">news archive</a>]. In a decision released Friday, the chamber recalled its earlier determination that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not of the appropriate severity to continue the proceedings against Abu Garda and found that the prosecution&#39;s petition did not meet the requirements for an appeal. The prosecutor argued in the appeal that the court had applied a stricter <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/F1E0AC1C-A3F3-4A3C-B9A7-B3E8B115E886/140164/Rules_of_procedure_and_Evidence_English.pdf">evidentiary standard</a> [Rules of Evidence, PDF] in the Pre-Trial Chamber than it should have employed. In denying the appeal, the ICC said:<br /><blockquote><br />[N]either the Statute nor the Rules, contrary to the Prosecution&#39;s assertion, draws a distinction as to the way evidence shall be assessed before a Trial Chamber and a Pre-Trial Chamber. The free assessment of the evidence presented by a party is, pursuant to the Statute, a core component of the judicial activity both at the pre-trial stage of a case and at trial. ... In light of the above, the proposition put forward by the Prosecution, namely that the Chamber should have applied a different standard to the assessment of the evidence at the confirmation of the charges stage, is without any legal basis.<br /></blockquote><br />In the event that the prosecution provides additional evidence, it may still seek the confirmation of the charges or petition the chamber to appeal the decision.<br /><br />The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/icc-drops-charges-against-sudan-rebel.php">declined to confirm charges</a> against Abu Garda in February, a ruling that came after a <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/icc-begins-sudan-rebel-leader.php">preliminary hearing</a> [JURIST reports] in October, during which the prosecution alleged that Abu Garda controlled the <a href="http://www.sudanjem.com/">Justice and Equality Movement</a> [official website, in Arabic]. The charges against Abu Garda stem from a series of attacks in 2007 that resulted in the death of 12 African Union Mission in Sudan soldiers. Abu Garda <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sudan-rebel-leader-appears-before-icc.php">first appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the ICC on the charges in May 2009, and is the first individual involved in the situation in Darfur to appear before the court.

After an attack Sunday on a former premier&#39;s home left 11 people injured, the reds dug into their fortified bunker in Bangkok in anticipation of government retaliation. Yellow shirt representatives have said that if the government will not crack down on the reds, the group is prepared to take action itself.<br /><br />Last week, Thai <a href="http://www.pm.go.th/">Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> [official website; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7780309.stm">BBC profile</a>] announced that he is prepared to negotiate with red shirt protesters once they cease their illegal conduct. Thai courts have recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-court-issues-arrest-warrants.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for several high-profile protesters, including high-ranking officials of the red shirt opposition, in connection with violent protests and an alleged <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/35814/warrants-out-for-7-raiders">break-in at Parliament</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report]. Internal divisions have been mounting steadily in Thailand since the 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ouster</a> [JURIST report] of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], whose progressive policies engendered the support of the poor rural class that largely constitutes the reds today. The yellows, primarily consisting of the urban middle-class, considered Shinawatra, and as well as the reds, disloyal to the monarchy. Because of the mounting violence, Abhisit has <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">imposed a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in Bangkok and neighboring provinces.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers representing <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>], a Canadian currently being detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], say they will seek to suppress statements he made during interrogation at a preliminary hearing to begin Wednesday. The hearing is to be the last before his US <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] trial in July, the first to commence under the Obama administration, which <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/20/AR2009012004743.html">suspended the military commissions</a> [WP report] after his inauguration in January 2009. Khadr&#39;s defense team <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N23188466.htm">plans to bring forward</a> [Reuters report] as many as thirty guards, interrogators, and witnesses to testify that incriminating statements made by Khadr were the product of torture. Khadr&#39;s defense lawyers claim that Khadr was subject to 142 interrogations at both <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">Bagram Air Base</a> [JURIST news archive] and Guantanamo Bay. Prosecutors have described these claims as baseless, and have <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/omar-khadr-pushes-to-have-statements-video-thrown-out-in-court/article1546052/">countered</a> [G&amp;M report] that Khadr&#39;s treatment at the hands of interrogators was humane. The Obama administration has also been seeking the extradition of Khadr&#39;s brother Abdullah Khadr, currently detained by Canadian authorities in Toronto, for trial in the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website]. Abdullah is suspected of supplying weapons to <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. <br /><br />Khadr&#39;s lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] in February in the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] challenging the decision of the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">not to seek his repatriation from the United States</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the government was not obligated to seek Khadr&#39;s return to Canada despite having violated his rights under section 7 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/UpdateNotice/index.html?rp14=/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. Khadr has allegedly admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/khadr-admitted-throwing-grenade-that.php">throwing a hand grenade</a> that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan, and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese authorities have arrested a prominent Tibetan writer after he signed a letter critical of the Chinese government&#39;s relief efforts following the recent <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/database/2010-04/14/c_13250759.htm">earthquake in the western Qinghai</a> [Xinhua backgrounder] province, a family friend said Monday. Tra Gyal, who writes under the pseudonym Zhogs Dung, was reportedly <a href="http://calamities.gaeatimes.com/2010/04/26/tibetan-writer-detained-after-signing-open-letter-critical-of-chinas-quake-efforts-18768/">arrested</a> [AP report] while working at the Nationalities Publishing House in the provincial capital Xining. Tra Gyal helped <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7108169.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=797093">organize private donations</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> report] for those left homeless in the remote Yushu county, a Tibet Autonomous Prefecture, by asking Tibetans not to send donations through official channels but rather to travel to the county themselves to guarantee their donations reached those in need. It is unclear whether Tra Gyal&#39;s detention is related to his criticism of the earthquake relief efforts.<br /><br />In February, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-earthquake-activist-sentenced-to.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Tan Zuoren to five years in prison on subversion charges after he documented the lethal consequences of substandard construction in the Sichuan province&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2008/china_quake/default.stm">2008 earthquake</a> [BBC backgrounder], which left some 90,000 dead. A Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-human-rights-activist-huang-qi.php">sentenced another earthquake activist</a> [JURIST report], Huang Qi, to three years in prison in November on the charge of illegally holding state secrets. Huang was a critic of the Chinese government&#39;s handling of the 2008 disaster. After the quake, he posted articles online criticizing the government&#39;s response and talked to foreign media outlets about how some children&#39;s deaths were the result of poorly-built schools. Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/040/2009/en/9ede45c2-3943-4a5b-b75b-7ef68fb6d787/asa170402009en.html">issued a statement</a> [text] in July urging China to drop the charges against Huang and release him from custody.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-26-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/april2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-448.pdf">Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co.</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-to-consider-release-of.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether whether &sect; 502(g)(1) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch18.html">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [materials] provides a district court discretion to award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees only to a prevailing party, and whether a party is entitled to attorney&#39;s fees when she persuades a district court that a violation of ERISA has occurred, successfully secures a judicially-ordered remand requiring a redetermination of entitlement to benefits, and subsequently receives the benefits sought on remand. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081896.U.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that &sect; 502(g)(1) provides a district court discretion to award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees only to a prevailing party. Counsel for petitioner argued that she &quot;is eligible for a fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper application of this Court&#39;s established fee standards under any test this Court has previously established.&quot; Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of petitioner. Counsel for the respondent argued that &quot;the Petitioner must demonstrate some success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she must specify the judgment entitling her to an award.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-497.pdf">Rent-A-Center v. Jackson</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether a district court is required in all cases to determine claims that an arbitration agreement subject to the <a href="http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29568">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [materials] is unconscionable, even when the parties to the contract have clearly and unmistakably assigned this &quot;gateway&quot; issue to the arbitrator for decision. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/09/09/07-16164.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that that the district court was required to determine whether the arbitration agreement was unconscionable. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<br /><blockquote><br />The agreement between Antonio Jackson and Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written. There is no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide Jackson&#39;s challenge to enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from making the determination - prohibit the arbitrator from making the determination of Jackson&#39;s challenge to unconscionability.<br /></blockquote><br />Counsel for the respondent argued that &quot;Petitioner would have the Court adopt a rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed enforceable before their validity has been determined by a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Liberian Justice Minister Christiana Tah has said that a <a href="https://www.trcofliberia.org/reports/final">report</a> [materials] issued by the <a href="https://www.trcofliberia.org/">Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TRC) [official website] will be reviewed by Liberian officials in order to determine if prosecutions for possible war crimes should proceed. The TRC report, issued last December, detailed crimes committed during Liberia&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmil/background.shtml">civil war</a> [UNMIL backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1043500.stm">backgrounder</a>], including the recruitment of child soldiers, the rape of women, as well as the death of more than 250,000 citizens. According to Tah, the committee reviewing the TRC report will be trying to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/25/AR2010042501428.html">determine who committed the most serious atrocities</a> [Reuters report] so that prosecutions can proceed as quickly as possible. Some in Liberia are skeptical that the government will proceed with prosecutions based on the TRC report. One of the report&#39;s most controversial recommendations is a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/libera-truth-commission-recommends-30.php">proposed 30-year ban</a> [JURIST report] from holding office for those who supported the civil conflict, which could affect prominent leaders such as current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4395978.stm">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> [BBC profile]. Skeptics contend it is unlikely that Sirleaf would support some of the recommendations while ignoring those that would have a direct impact on her political future. Supporters of the TRC report contend that prosecutions are necessary to achieving justice but warn that the process would be drawn out and that it could take up to 10 years before the trials could be held. <br /><br />The TRC report also contained a list of &quot;Most Notorious Predators&quot; and a list of perpetrators of economic crimes, which includes the head of the legal association for the defense of former president <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">Charles Taylor</a> [JURIST news archive]. Taylor is currently <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx">on trial</a> [case materials] before the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> [official website] sitting at The Hague. Taylor faces <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">11 counts</a> [indictment, PDF] of crimes against humanity, violations of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [materials], and other violations of international humanitarian law stemming from a &quot;campaign to terrorize the civilian population&quot; of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sierra+Leone">Sierra Leone</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for victims of the July 7, 2005 <a href="/currentawareness/london.php">London transit bombings</a> [JURIST news archive] argued on Monday in the Royal Courts of Justice that UK authorities possessed information that could have helped them prevent the attacks. The theory for the case is built on intelligence that British security service <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/uk-home-page.html">MI5</a> [official website] and the London police had uncovered about the four suicide bombers prior to the attacks. Counsel for bereaved families argued that the UK government breached obligations to its citizens under Article 2 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], which provides for the right to life. MI5 and the <a href="http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Secretary</a> [official website] argued in response to the prosecution&#39;s arguments that the matter has already been investigated in the <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/intelligence.aspx">Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee</a> (ISC) [official website] and that the intelligence could undermine law enforcement efforts if made public. The hearing is scheduled to last for three days.<br /><br />In January, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/uk-introduces-compensation-scheme-for.php">introduced a scheme</a> [JURIST report] for compensating victims of overseas terrorism, using a plan that closely mirrors that used to compensate families of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2005/london_explosions/default.stm">July 2005 bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In November, London police <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/london-police-settle-with-family-of-man.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the family of a man mistaken for one of the terrorist suspects involved in the bomb plot. In April 2008, the UK Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-court-rejects-appeal-by-convicted.php">rejected the appeal</a> [JURIST report] of four men found guilty of plotting the London attacks. The 2005 bombings targeted three trains and one bus, killing 52 people and injuring at least 770.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/index.php?rubrique=10016&ssrubrique=10019">Justice Minister Michele Alliot-Marie</a> [official profile, in French] and Jordan&#39;s <a href="http://www.kingabdullah.jo/main.php?main_page=3&lang_hmka1=1">King Abdullah II</a> [official profile] met Sunday to discuss <a href="http://www.kingabdullah.jo/news/details.php?kn_serial=8292&menu_id=26&lang_hmka1=1">increasing cooperation</a> [press release] between France and Jordan&#39;s judicial and legislative branches and strengthening the ties between the two countries. Alliot-Marie told reporters that France would <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=114188#axzz0mDWOjkWE">send legal experts</a> [AFP report] to Jordan to help strengthen its court system. Sunday&#39;s talks follow the <a href="http://www.petra.gov.jo/Artical.aspx?Lng=1&Section=1&Artical=105529">protocol</a> [Petra report] signed by France and Jordan last April to enhance the countries&#39; legal cooperation. The protocol provides for the exchange of current legal and judicial releases and research highlighting the countries&#39; judiciary, and underscores revisions of Jordan&#39;s current civil and criminal laws.<br /><br />Jordan has employed a series of legal reforms to address the concerns of many human rights groups. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Jordan to <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/jordan-urged-to-restore-rule-of-law-by.php">restore its rule of law</a> [JURIST report] by ending extrajudicial detentions of crime victims, personal enemies, and persons freed by the courts. Per the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18279.htm">1954 Crime Prevention Law</a> [DOS backgrounder], which is currently in effect, government officials have the power to order administrative detentions on mere suspicions of improper behavior rather than on the showing of evidence that a crime has been committed. HRW asserted that the formulation and application of Jordan&#39;s Crime Prevention Law violates international standards as well as Articles 7 and 8 of the <a href="http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/jordan/jorpolcon.htm">Jordan Constitution</a> [text], which states that &quot;Personal freedom shall be guaranteed,&quot; and that &quot;No person may be detained or imprisoned except in accordance with the provisions of the law.&quot; The HRW report alleges that Jordan officials frequently circumvent the judicial system under which potential defendants are afforded due process and also that the subjects of such extrajudicial detentions are often the victims of crimes rather than the perpetrators themselves.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042610zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/08-1448.htm">Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/08-1448_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] permits any limits on offensive content in violent video games sold to minors, and whether a state regulation for displaying offensive, harmful images to children is invalid if it fails to satisfy the exacting &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard of review. <a href="http://law.justia.com/california/codes/civ/1746-1746.5.html">California Civil Code sections 1746-1746.5</a> [text] prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors under 18 where a reasonable person would find that the violent content appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors, is patently offensive to prevailing community standards as to what is suitable for minors, and causes the game as a whole to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/20/0716620.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-rules-ban-on-video-game.php">report</a>] the district court&#39;s judgment permanently enjoining enforcement of the prohibition.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-737.htm">Ortiz v. Jordan</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/09-737_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether a party may appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits if the party chose not to appeal the order before trial. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0196n-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that, &quot;although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after a trial on the merits, denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule.&quot; There is a circuit split on this issue.<br /><br />Also Monday, the court decided not to allow Michigan to reopen a <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/12-21-09_Carp_Fact_Sheet_305177_7.pdf">longstanding controversy</a> [backgrounder, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">report</a>] with the state of Illinois seeking to close two waterways that allow invasive Asian carp to reach the Great Lakes. The court also refused to allow Michigan to open a new case on the issue.

The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081896.U.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that s. 502(g)(1) provides a district court discretion to award reasonable attorney&#39;s fees only to a prevailing party. Counsel for petitioner argued that she &quot;is eligible for a fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper application of this Court&#39;s established fee standards under any test this Court has previously established.&quot; Counsel for the US government argued as <i>amicus curiae</i> on behalf of petitioner. Counsel for the respondent argued that &quot;the Petitioner must demonstrate some success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she must specify the judgment entitling her to an award.&quot;

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-497.pdf">Rent-A-Center v. Jackson</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether a district court is required in all cases to determine claims that an arbitration agreement subject to the <a href="http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29568">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [materials] is unconscionable, even when the parties to the contract have clearly and unmistakably assigned this &quot;gateway&quot; issue to the arbitrator for decision. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/09/09/07-16164.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that that the district court was required to determine whether the arbitration agreement was unconscionable. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>The agreement between Antonio Jackson and Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written. There is no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide Jackson&#39;s challenge to enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from making the determination - prohibit the arbitrator from making the determination of Jackson&#39;s challenge to unconscionability.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that &quot;Petitioner would have the Court adopt a rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed enforceable before their validity has been determined by a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new wing, part of Cipinang Penitentiary in East Jakarta, is designed to hold up to 256 inmates, although only 10 people are currently incarcerated there. The country&#39;s <a href="http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/news/">Corruption Eradication Commission</a> (KPK) [official website, in Bahasa] is responsible for sentencing inmates to prison terms in the new facility. The wing was added to alleviate <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=prison+overcrowding">overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Indonesian prison system and was also in response to criticism that wealthy prisoners are permitted to live in luxury.

In reversing the decision below, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<blockquote>Contrary to the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the question as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class arbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there was &quot;no agreement&quot; on this question, it follows that the parties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to class arbitration.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the consideration of the case.</p>

<p>The case arose when <a href="http://www.animalfeeds.com/">AnimalFeeds</a> filed a class action lawsuit against four major shipping companies, including <a href="http://www.stolt-nielsen.com/">Stolt-Nielsen</a> [corporate websites], alleging antitrust violations. The parties had a written contract, under which their case was referred to an arbitration panel. The contract was silent as to whether class arbitrations are permissible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The military intends to return the detainees to their countries of origin in anticipation of a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/afghanistan-authorities-commit-to.php">transfer of the facility</a> [JURIST report] to Afghan authorities at the end of the year. Although the military has refused to confirm the number of foreign nationals being held at the base, it is believed that approximately 30 to 60 are being detained. Rights of foreign nationals in US overseas prisons continue to present pressing legal questions as the Obama administration contemplates handing additional authority over to the Afghan government. Compounding the issue is the fact that detainees at the facility have recently <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/04/bagram-detainees-allege-torture-at.php">alleged torture</a> [JURIST report] at a secret prison housed within the air base, bringing the facility into sharper focus for the US government. 

<p>Alleged prisoner abuse linked to the war on terror in Afghanistan has received international attention. This month a retired Canadian military officer who served in Afghanistan said that Canadian soldiers believed that prisoners <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/troops-knew-of-afghan-prisoner-abuse-retired-captain-says/article1528370/?cmpid=rss1">may have been abused</a> [Globe and Mail report] after being transferred to prison facilities in Afghanistan. Human rights groups have also criticized military procedures in the country. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-habeas-petitions-on-behalf.php">filed <i>habeas corpus</i> petitions</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of four detainees held at Bagram Air Base, claiming that none of the men has engaged in hostile behavior directed at the US, nor are they members of groups that purport to do so. In January, the US Department of Defense <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php">released a list of names</a> of 645 prisoners detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU last September. Prisoners at Bagram have launched previous <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-dismisses-afghan-bagram.php"><i>habeas corpus</i> challenges</a> [JURIST report] in US courts but thus far have been less successful than those held at <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from an <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">April 7 incident</a> [JURIST report] in which police fired on a crowd of anti-government demonstrators, killing more than 85 people. The crowd eventually overwhelmed security forces, ultimately overtaking the Kyrgyz government and forcing Bakiyev into exile. Bakiyev maintains that police only shot at the protesters after the crowd began firing on Kyrgyz government headquarters. Interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<i>Telegraph</i> profile] has <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring Bakiyev and other members of the former government to justice, but the government has so far succeeded in securing only the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl9bo4DfKFLUi5Ciy_d6bAOU8Vdg">arrest of former defense minister Baktybek Kaliyev</a> [AFP report] and the extradition Bakiyev&#39;s interior minister from Russia. Officials in Belarus, where Bakiyev currently resides, have not said whether they plan to return him to Kyrgyz custody. Interim government officials maintain that Belarus is obligated by treaties between former Soviet states to extradite Bakiyev.

<p>Otunbayeva <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">launched the new government</a> [JURIST report] after Bakiyev fled the capital earlier this month. Interim officials have had difficulty securing the nation in the wake of Bakiyev&#39;s ouster, facing pro-Bakiyev protests and questions about the new administration&#39;s legitimacy. Last week, Kyrgyzstan interim deputy leader Omurbek Tekebayev <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-to-hold-constitutional.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the country will hold a referendum on a new constitution this summer.

Investors brought the class action suit against Merck in 2003, alleging that it had deliberately concealed information about Vioxx. The case was <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/04/federal-judge-dismisses-vioxx.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge in April 2007 after he determined that investors were on &quot;inquiry notice&quot; of the alleged fraud in September 2001 when the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM166383.pdf">warning letter</a> [text, PDF] about the painkiller.

We also hold that the &quot;facts constituting the violation&quot; include the fact of scienter, &quot;a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,&quot;</blockquote>Justice John Paul Stevens filed a concurring opinion. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military official has said that the US is in negotiations to transfer non-Afghan detainees at <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bagram">news archive</a>] back to their home countries, Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/04/20104278111295558.html">reported</a> [text] Tuesday. The military intends to return the detainees to their countries of origin in anticipation of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/afghanistan-authorities-commit-to.php">transfer of the facility</a> [JURIST report] to Afghan authorities at the end of the year. Although the military has refused to confirm the number of foreign nationals being held at the base, it is believed that approximately 30 to 60 are being detained. Rights of foreign nationals in US overseas prisons continue to present pressing legal questions as the Obama administration contemplates handing additional authority over to the Afghan government. Compounding the issue is the fact that detainees at the facility have recently <a href="http://www.blogger.com/posts.g?security_token=AOuZoY7zPgG55zNIteyDHnyIfhPflJyhIA%3A1272382146851&blogID=4079894&label=&searchType=ALL&txtKeywords=bagram+&numPosts=25">alleged torture</a> [JURIST report] at a secret prison housed within the air base, bringing the facility into sharper focus for the US government. <br /><br />Alleged prisoner abuse linked to the war on terror in Afghanistan has received international attention. This month a retired Canadian military officer who served in Afghanistan said that Canadian soldiers believed that prisoners <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/troops-knew-of-afghan-prisoner-abuse-retired-captain-says/article1528370/?cmpid=rss1">may have been abused</a> [Globe and Mail report] after being transferred to prison facilities in Afghanistan. Human rights groups have also criticized military procedures in the country. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-habeas-petitions-on-behalf.php">filed <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of four detainees held at Bagram Air Base, claiming that none of the men has engaged in hostile behavior directed at the US, nor are they members of groups that purport to do so. In January, the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php">released a list of names</a> of 645 prisoners detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU last September. Prisoners at Bagram have launched previous <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-dismisses-afghan-bagram.php"><em>habeas corpus</em> challenges</a> [JURIST report] in US courts but thus far have been less successful than those held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Haitian judge on Monday dismissed charges of kidnapping and criminal association against all 10 members of a US missionary group <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/us-citizens-arrested-after-trying-to.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in January but ordered one to stand trial for making &quot;irregular travel&quot; arrangements involving 30 Haitian children. Laura Silsby, the only missionary who has not been released by Haitian authorities, will <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/04/26/haiti.missionaries/?hpt=T2">remain in custody</a> [CNN report] until her trial. According to a 1980 decree in the Haitian <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/fr/hti/fr_hti_penal.html#_Toc37077286">Criminal Code</a> [text, in French], irregular travel is the term for traveling or organizing travel originating in Haiti with a foreign destination in a manner that does not comply with established laws. If convicted, Silsby could face six months to three years of incarceration.<br /><br />Last month, a Haitian judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/haiti-judge-orders-release-of-us.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of one of the last two US missionaries out of a group of 10 who were arrested following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">January 12 earthquake</a> [JURIST news archive] in connection with their attempt to take 33 children across the Haitian border into the Dominican Republic. The judge had <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-judge-to-release-two-missionaries.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in February that the two remaining missionaries would also be released after the other eight members of the missionary group affiliated with the <a href="http://www.centralvalleybaptist.net/cvbc09/splash/haiti_statement.cfm?CFID=37667851&CFTOKEN=26943684">Central Valley Baptist Church</a> [church website] of Idaho and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8490843.stm">New Life Children&#39;s Refuge Charity</a> [BBC profile] were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-judge-orders-release-of-8-us.php">released</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. Haitian authorities originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/haiti-officials-charge-10-americans.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] each of the 10 missionaries in February with one count of kidnapping and one count of criminal association, asserting that many of the children were not orphans.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Panamanian military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>] arrived in France Tuesday to face money laundering charges after being extradited from the US. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] signed a surrender warrant Monday after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-lifts-noriega-extradition.php">lifted the stay</a> [JURIST report] blocking his extradition last month. Noriega will appear Tuesday before French prosecutors to hear the charges against him, which stem from allegedly laundering $3 million in drug profits by purchasing property in Paris. Noriega&#39;s lawyers have said they will <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lawyers-prepare-legal-challenge-after-noriega-extradited-to-france/article1547914/">seek his immediate release</a> [AP report], arguing that he is immune from prosecution as a former head of state.<br /><br />Noriega has been <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fighting extradition</a> [JURIST report] since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> in February after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January. Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but France agreed to hold a new trial if he was extradited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, Spanish] on Monday <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/?DNA=85&page=1&Prensa=15154&Contenido=55755">strongly criticized</a> [press release, in Spanish] Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, claiming that the measure opens the door to intolerance and hatred. The Arizona <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">bill</a> [SB 1070 materials], <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last week by Governor Jan Brewer, makes it a crime to be an undocumented immigrant and requires police to question anyone whose immigration status appears suspect. Calling the law a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/26/AR2010042603810.html?hpid=topnews">violation of human rights</a> [WP report], Calderon promised that it will be a pressing item on his agenda during his upcoming visit to Washington in May. Calderon has also called on Mexico&#39;s foreign ministry and consulates in the US to begin defending the rights of Mexicans and suggested that trade and political ties between Arizona and Mexico will be seriously affected.<br /><br />Two Latino advocacy groups have said they plan to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/advocacy-groups-to-challenge-arizona.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, alleging it permits racial profiling. Officials from the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website; <a href="http://maldef.org/news/releases/maldef_condemns_az_governor_042310/">press release</a>] and the <a href="http://www.conlamic.org/">National Coalition of Latino Christian Clergy</a> [advocacy website] contend the law will let police single out minorities for immigration inspections. US President Barack Obama has also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/obama-criticizes-proposed-arizona.php">criticized the law</a> [JURIST report], calling for federal immigration reform. Under the law, it is designated a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F9G7TG0">crime</a> [AP report] to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1198.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1198">Stolt-Nielsen SA v. AnimalFeeds International</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on_09.php">report</a>] that imposing class arbitration on parties when that issue is silent in the parties&#39; arbitration clauses is inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29568">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [9 USC &sect;&sect; 1-14 text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9d05f21f-797e-4084-aa97-ef6f409d114f/2/doc/06-3474-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9d05f21f-797e-4084-aa97-ef6f409d114f/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that construing the arbitration clause to permit class arbitration &quot;did not manifestly disregard the law&quot; because the parties specifically agreed that the arbitration panel would decide on the scope of the clause and, therefore, the panel did not exceed its authority. In reversing the decision below, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />Contrary to the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the question as being whether the parties agreed to authorize class arbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there was &quot;no agreement&quot; on this question, it follows that the parties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to class arbitration.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the consideration of the case.<br /><br />The case arose when <a href="http://www.animalfeeds.com/">AnimalFeeds</a> filed a class action lawsuit against four major shipping companies, including <a href="http://www.stolt-nielsen.com/">Stolt-Nielsen</a> [corporate websites], alleging antitrust violations. The parties had a written contract, under which their case was referred to an arbitration panel. The contract was silent as to whether class arbitrations are permissible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials in Kyrgyzstan&#39;s interim government said Tuesday that ousted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4660317.stm">Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> [BBC profile; <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Kurmanbek+Bakiyev">JURIST news archive</a>] has been charged with mass murder, for which he will be tried <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span>. The charges stem from an <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-protesters-set-fire-to.php">April 7 incident</a> [JURIST report] in which police fired on a crowd of anti-government demonstrators, killing more than 85 people. The crowd eventually overwhelmed security forces, ultimately overtaking the Kyrgyz government and forcing Bakiyev into exile. Bakiyev maintains that police only shot at the protesters after the crowd began firing on Kyrgyz government headquarters. Interim leader <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-interim-leader-calls-for.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring Bakiyev and other members of the former government to justice, but the government has so far succeeded in securing only the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl9bo4DfKFLUi5Ciy_d6bAOU8Vdg">arrest of former defense minister Baktybek Kaliyev</a> [AFP report] and the extradition Bakiyev&#39;s interior minister from Russia. Officials in Belarus, where Bakiyev currently resides, have not said whether they plan to return him to Kyrgyz custody. Interim government officials maintain that Belarus is obligated by treaties between former Soviet states to extradite Bakiyev.<br /><br />Otunbayeva <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">launched the new government</a> [JURIST report] after Bakiyev fled the capital earlier this month. Interim officials have had difficulty securing the nation in the wake of Bakiyev&#39;s ouster, facing pro-Bakiyev protests and questions about the new administration&#39;s legitimacy. Last week, Kyrgyzstan interim deputy leader Omurbek Tekebayev <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-to-hold-constitutional.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the country will hold a referendum on a new constitution this summer. That same week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-group-calls-for-inquiry-into_21.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the interim government to conduct an investigation into the violence that resulted in Bakiyev&#39;s overthrow. <a href="http://www.unece.org/Welcome.htm">UN Economic Commission for Europe</a> (UNECE) [advocacy website] Executive Director <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=140">Jan Kubis</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34394&Cr=peacebuilding&Cr1=">said</a> [press release] earlier this month that Kyrgyzstan needs international support in order to continue democratic reforms. The new government has received support from both the US and Russia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indonesia&#39;s justice minister announced Tuesday the opening of a prison wing intended to confine individuals convicted of corruption. The new wing, part of Cipinang Penitentiary in East Jakarta, is designed to hold up to 256 inmates, although only 10 people are currently incarcerated there. The country&#39;s <a href="http://www.kpk.go.id/modules/news/">Corruption Eradication Commission</a> (KPK) [official website, in Bahasa] is responsible for sentencing inmates to prison terms in the new facility. The wing was added to alleviate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=prison+overcrowding">overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Indonesian prison system and was also in response to criticism that wealthy prisoners are permitted to live in luxury. Anti-corruption reform has been one of the primary concerns of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/y/susilo_bambang_yudhoyono/index.html">President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [NYT profile], and the opening of the prison wing highlights corruption concerns in the civilian and military branches of the government. <br /><br />Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/89867">wrote</a> [letter text] to the Indonesian parliament urging the passage of a bill that would allow civilian officials to prosecute soldiers who commit crimes against civilians. Also last week, the independent, non-governmental organization <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/">International Crisis Group</a> (ICG) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/189%20Indonesia%20-%20Jihadi%20Surprise%20in%20Aceh.ashx">report</a> [text, PDF] stating that &quot;corruption continues to be a major lubricant for terrorist activities in Indonesia.&quot; In February, the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/indonesia.corruption.antasari.trial/index.html">prosecution of Antasari Azhar</a> [CNN report], former chief of the KPK, again raised corruption concerns in the country. In January, Indonesian protesters <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8484822.stm">took to the streets</a> [BBC report] in response to corruption scandals in Yudhoyono&#39;s administration. Last year, two senior law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/indonesia-law-enforcement-officials.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] after being linked to an alleged plot to weaken the KPK.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday allowed a suit to proceed against drug maker <a href="http://www.merck.com/">Merck &amp; Co.</a> [corporate website] over the safety record of its painkiller <a href="/currentawareness/vioxx.php">Vioxx</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-905.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-905">Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-false.php">report</a>] that the statute of limitations in a securities fraud lawsuit begins to run once the plaintiff actually discovered or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the violation - whichever comes first. Investors brought the class action suit against Merck in 2003, alleging that it had deliberately concealed information about Vioxx. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/federal-judge-dismisses-vioxx.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge in April 2007 after he determined that investors were on &quot;inquiry notice&quot; of the alleged fraud in September 2001 when the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM166383.pdf">warning letter</a> [text, PDF] about the painkiller. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072431p.pdf">reinstated the case</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/third-circuit-reinstates-vioxx-class.php">report</a>] in September 2008, finding that the district judge had &quot;acted prematurely in finding as a matter of law that [the investors] were on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud.&quot; In affirming the decision below, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote:<br /><blockquote><br />Construing this limitations statute for the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1) when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, &quot;the facts constituting the violation&quot; - whichever comes first. We also hold that the &quot;facts constituting the violation&quot; include the fact of scienter, &quot;a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,&quot;<br /></blockquote><br />Justice John Paul Stevens filed a concurring opinion. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.<br /><br />Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html">28 USC &sect; 1658(b)</a> [text], a plaintiff has two years to file a claim alleging violation of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF]. The first fraud complaint against the company was filed in November of 2003. Merck pulled Vioxx from the market in September 2004 after a study showed that it could double the risk of heart attack or stroke if taken for more than 18 months.

<p>In December, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc787666.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] Bemba to <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/12/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial.

The ICC has <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/06/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">ordered Bemba to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes allegedly committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder] from October 2002 to May 2003.

The case arose over an injunction against the planting of Monsanto&#39;s &quot;Roundup Ready alfalfa,&quot; pending an environmental impact statement. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/24/07-16458.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] plaintiffs are specially exempt from the requirement of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to obtain an injunction, affirming the nationwide injunction. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the district court, &quot;short-circuited the requisite inquiry into the likelihood of reparable - irreparable harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to get into this anyway in the course of preparing its environmental impact statement.&quot; Counsel for respondents argued:<blockquote>In our view Petitioners lack standing to bring this case to this Court. By failing to challenge the lawfulness of the deregulation vacatur either in the Ninth Circuit or in this Court, Petitioners have an insurmountable redressability problem. They cannot get the practical relief they seek even in the event that this Court vacates or narrows the injunction.</blockquote>The case is being closely followed by environmental and industry groups.]]></content:encoded>

The historic ruling is a significant victory for opposition parties over Harper&#39;s minority Conservative government. In his ruling, Milliken said:<blockquote>The Chair must conclude that it is within the powers of the House of Commons to ask for the documents sought in the December 10 order it adopted. Now, it seems to me, that the issue before us is this: is it possible to put into place a mechanism by which these documents could be made available to the House without compromising the security and confidentiality of the information they contain? In other words, is it possible for the two sides, working together in the best interest of the Canadians they serve, to devise a means where both their concerns are met? Surely that is not too much to hope for.</blockquote>Milliken gave both sides two weeks to reach a compromise. If no agreement can be reached, members of Harper&#39;s cabinet, including the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and justice, could be held in contempt of Parliament. Although the Harper government has indicated its general willingness to comply with the Speaker&#39;s ruling, it might yet <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/798814--struggle-between-parliament-and-government-could-reach-supreme-court?bn=1">pass the general issue</a> [<i>Toronto Star</i> report] of executive versus legislative authority on to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] as a constitutional reference question for its formal determination.  

<p>The release of the detainee documents has been highly controversial. Last month, Canadian <a href="http://www.robnicholsonmp.ca/EN/3302/">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson</a> [official profile] announced that former Supreme Court justice <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/iacobucci/iacobucci.html">Frank Iacobucci</a> [U. Toronto backgrounder] would <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/canada-judge-to-review-afghan-detainee.php">review documents</a> [JURIST report] detailing Canadian forces&#39; handing of Afghan detainees and the terms of their transfer to Afghan authorities before the documents would be released to Parliament. Nicholson indicated that Iacobucci would report back to Nicholson, who would determine the conditions of disclosure. In December, Parliament passed an <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/12/canadian-opposition-measure-seeks.php">order to compel</a> Harper to release the unredacted documents after the Canadian government <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/12/canada-government-releases-e-mails.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] more than 40 <a href="http://www.bccla.org/antiterrorissue/ColvinDocs3.pdf">redacted e-mails</a> [text, PDF] sent by Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin to then-foreign minister <a href="http://www.petermackay.ca/meet_peter.php">Peter MacKay</a> [official profile] raising concerns about the torture of transferred detainees. The release of the e-mails came after Colvin <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/11/senior-canada-diplomat-accuses-military.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before a Commons committee in November that all enemy combatants captured in 2006 and 2007 by Canadian forces were likely tortured upon their transfer to Afghan authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Buono</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-first.php">report</a>] that the lower courts were wrong to ban government from transferring public land containing a religious symbol to a private entity. The court also held that an individual has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html">Article III</a> [text] standing to bring a suit under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the First Amendment challenging the display of a religious symbol on government land. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/09/05/0555852.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the transfer of the public land to a private entity is not a permissible accommodation. Authoring the plurality opinion for a deeply divided court, Justice Anthony Kennedy reversed the decision below:<blockquote>Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality. The same respect requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the land-transfer statute.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion. He would not have remanded the case to the district court. Justice Antonin Scalia also filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Scalia believes that the plaintiff lacks standing. Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a separate dissent.

<p>The dispute concerns a Latin cross on a rock outcropping in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/moja/index.htm">Mojave National Preserve</a> [official website]. The display of the cross on public property had already been found in violation of the Establishment Clause, so the government sought to transfer the portion of land on which the cross was located to a private entity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The manual establishes the rules of evidence and procedure for the commissions, allowing for the admission of certain hearsay evidence and defining &quot;material support&quot; for terrorism. The manual&#39;s release came one day before a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/khadr-seeking-suppression-of.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] in the case of Canadian <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] on whether his alleged confessions may be used as evidence. The hearing was postponed briefly Wednesday morning to allow Khadr&#39;s lawyers time to review the new manual and was set to resume Wednesday afternoon.

<p>Khadr&#39;s military commission trial, set to begin in July, will be the first under the Obama administration, which suspended military commissions shortly after the January 2009 inauguration. In February, Khadr&#39;s lawyers <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] challenging the decision of the Canadian government <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">not to seek his repatriation from the US</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court of Canada <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the government was not obligated to seek Khadr&#39;s return to Canada despite having violated his rights under section 7 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/UpdateNotice/index.html?rp14=/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text].

In the resolution, the Security Council noted its previous resolutions regarding piracy, particularly <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=somalia+pirate">piracy off the coast of Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive], as well as the continuing security issues posed by piracy. The ineffectual nature of past resolutions, combined with the lack of action by the Somali government and the difficulties faced by Kenya, one of the few African nations to attempt to prosecute piracy, may have led to the inclusion of the request that the secretary-general investigate options for UN prosecution of piracy. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, had <a href="http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=119367">previously proposed</a> [APA report] that the UN establish a special court for Somali pirates. The resolution asks that the Secretary General&#39;s report on prosecutorial options be completed within three months.</p>

<p>The Security Council resolution comes the same week the UN announced that a trust fund established to combat piracy will be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34472&amp;Cr=somali&amp;Cr1=">funding five projects</a> [UN News Centre report] aimed at piracy committed in the waters around Somalia. The same day, unsealed indicments revealed that the US had <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/us-prosecutors-indict-11-suspected.php">filed charges against 11 Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Earlier this month, Kenya announced that it would <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer accept referred piracy cases</a> [JURIST report], which have overburdened its judicial system, an announcement that may have spurred the Security Council to act. In January, the International Chamber of Commerce released a report indicating that maritime piracy had <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">reached its highest levels since 2003</a> [JURIST report].</p>

HRW says that detainees held at the Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks, and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. HRW interviewed 42 men who were among 300 transferred out after the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights gained access to the facility, which falls under the authority of the military office of Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">profile</a>]. The fact that many Sunnis were detained in the facility may reveal growing sectarian tensions within Iraq between the Maliki&#39;s Shiite government and Sunni Muslims. Maliki <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/27/iraq.prison.abuse/index.html?hpt=T2">denied</a> [CNN report] the reports of a secret prison, claiming the facility was publicly known and that the reports of abuse are exaggerated. 

<p>Earlier this month, it was revealed in a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/africa/la-fg-iraq-prison19-2010apr19,0,4657710.story">report</a> [text] that hundreds of Sunni men were <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/sunnis-held-without-warrant-tortured-in.php">detained without warrant and subjected to torture</a> [JURIST report] in the Muthanna facility. More than 400 men were initially detained in October during sweeps of Nineveh province, an area in which <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/al-qaeda_in_iraq.htm">al Qaeda in Iraq</a> (AQI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] was active, and transferred to a Baghdad prison due to concerns over corruption in the provincial capitol of Mosul. Maliki <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-pm-creates-prison-abuse.php">created a special committee</a> [JURIST report] in June to investigate alleged abuse and torture in the country&#39;s prisons. Comprised of eight members, the committee includes representatives from human rights and judicial government agencies and security ministries. The decision to create the panel came shortly after <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-authorities-charging-police.php">charges were brought</a> [JURIST report] against 43 Iraqi police officers for human rights abuses, warrantless arrests, and bribery allegations. The violations were discovered by an investigatory committee formed by Iraqi <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Bolani">Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law abolishes the statute of limitations for serious capital crimes, which was previously 25 years, and <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T100427005366.htm">extends</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Daily Yomiuri</span> report] the limitation period for sexual assault and other crimes resulting in death from 15 to 30 years. The law also doubles prison terms for other crimes resulting in death. Japanese Justice Minister Keiko Chiba <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100428a4.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+japantimes+%28The+Japan+Times%3A+All+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader">utilized the new law</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Kyodo News</span> report] Tuesday to keep open an unsolved case from 1995 that was set to expire at midnight. While criminal procedure laws are normally not enacted for at least a week while they are reviewed by the emperor prior to publication, this law was enforced immediately to keep unsolved cases open.

<p>Japan has recently taken steps to reform its criminal procedure system. Last year, Japan <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/08/japan-court-reaches-guilty-verdict-in.php">held its first jury trial</a> [JURIST report] since the end of World War II, with the <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/tokyo/">Tokyo District Court</a> [official website, in Japanese] convicting Katsuyoshi Fujii of murder. In 2004, the National Diet enacted the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_06.1_anderson.pdf">Lay Assessor Act</a> [materials, PDF; Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/issues/issues03.html">backgrounder</a>], which impanels professional and lay judges to decide and sentence capital cases and cases involving an intentional death. Panels can be made up of three professional judges and six lay judges or one professional judge and four lay judges. For their verdicts to stand, lay judges need the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8188447.stm">concurrence</a> [BBC report] of at least one professional judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government announced Tuesday that it has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/28/c_13270077.htm">lifted a ban on entry</a> [Xinhua report] into that country for individuals with HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The ban was originally implemented under the <a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/29/content_27332.htm">Frontier Health and Quarantine Law</a> and the <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/travel/2008-01/03/content_1225538.htm">Law on Control of the Entry and Exit of Aliens</a> [texts], both passed in 1987. The ban had temporarily been lifted for international events, such as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, but the inconvenience that resulted, as well as the increased knowledge of how HIV/AIDS is spread, were reasons cited by the government as factors for changing the law. China&#39;s action <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/PressCentre/PressReleases/2010/20100427_PS_China_travel_restrictions.asp">drew praise</a> [press release] from the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/">Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> [official website], which urged the 51 countries and areas that still bar entry to individuals with HIV/AIDS to follow China&#39;s lead in overturning their bans. The lifting of the ban does not enjoy widespread support from Chinese civilians, however, with 84 percent supporting <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-04/01/content_9671854.htm">keeping the ban in place</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report].<br /><br />Until recently, the US was one of the nations with an entry ban for individuals with HIV/AIDS. That <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-hivaids-travel-ban-lifted.php">ban was lifted in January</a> [JURIST report] when the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a> [official website] removed HIV/AIDS from its list of communicable diseases of public significance. It was first reported in late November that China was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-considering-lifting-ban-on.php">considering lifting the entry ban</a> [JURIST report], ahead of the Shanghai Expo scheduled for May of this year. China had previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/china-to-relax-entry-prohibition.php">relaxed its restrictions on entry</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi detainees were <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/04/27/iraq-detainees-describe-torture-secret-jail">repeatedly tortured</a> [press release] in a secret prison in Baghdad, <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) said Tuesday. HRW says that detainees held at the Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks, and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. HRW interviewed 42 men who were among 300 transferred out after the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights gained access to the facility, which falls under the authority of the military office of Iraqi <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">profile</a>]. The fact that many Sunnis were detained in the facility may reveal growing sectarian tensions within Iraq between the Maliki&#39;s Shiite government and Sunni Muslims. Maliki <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/27/iraq.prison.abuse/index.html?hpt=T2">denied</a> [CNN report] the reports of a secret prison, claiming the facility was publicly known and that the reports of abuse are exaggerated. <br /><br />Earlier this month, it was revealed in a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/africa/la-fg-iraq-prison19-2010apr19,0,4657710.story">report</a> [text] that hundreds of Sunni men were <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sunnis-held-without-warrant-tortured-in.php">detained without warrant and subjected to torture</a> [JURIST report] in the Muthanna facility. More than 400 men were initially detained in October during sweeps of Nineveh province, an area in which <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/al-qaeda_in_iraq.htm">al Qaeda in Iraq</a> (AQI) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] was active, and transferred to a Baghdad prison due to concerns over corruption in the provincial capitol of Mosul. Maliki <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-pm-creates-prison-abuse.php">created a special committee</a> [JURIST report] in June to investigate alleged abuse and torture in the country&#39;s prisons. Comprised of eight members, the committee includes representatives from human rights and judicial government agencies and security ministries. The decision to create the panel came shortly after <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/iraq-authorities-charging-police.php">charges were brought</a> [JURIST report] against 43 Iraqi police officers for human rights abuses, warrantless arrests, and bribery allegations. The violations were discovered by an investigatory committee formed by Iraqi <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bolani">Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] on Tuesday released a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d2010manual.pdf">manual</a> [text, PDF] for <a href="/currentawareness/militarycommissions.php">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] procedures under the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF]. The manual establishes the rules of evidence and procedure for the commissions, allowing for the admission of certain hearsay evidence and defining &quot;material support&quot; for terrorism. The manual&#39;s release came one day before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/khadr-seeking-suppression-of.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] in the case of Canadian <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] on whether his alleged confessions may be used as evidence. The hearing was postponed briefly Wednesday morning to allow Khadr&#39;s lawyers time to review the new manual and was set to resume Wednesday afternoon.<br /><br />Khadr&#39;s military commission trial, set to begin in July, will be the first under the Obama administration, which suspended military commissions shortly after the January 2009 inauguration. In February, Khadr&#39;s lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] challenging the decision of the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">not to seek his repatriation from the US</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the government was not obligated to seek Khadr&#39;s return to Canada despite having violated his rights under section 7 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/UpdateNotice/index.html?rp14=/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. Khadr has allegedly admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/khadr-admitted-throwing-grenade-that.php">throwing a hand grenade</a> that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan, and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in April 2007 with murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-472.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-472">Salazar v. Buono</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-first.php">report</a>] that the lower courts were wrong to ban government from transferring public land containing a religious symbol to a private entity. The court also held that an individual has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html">Article III</a> [text] standing to bring a suit under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the First Amendment challenging the display of a religious symbol on government land. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/09/05/0555852.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the transfer of the public land to a private entity is not a permissible accommodation. Authoring the plurality opinion for a deeply divided court, Justice Anthony Kennedy reversed the decision below:<br /><blockquote><br />Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality. The same respect requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the land-transfer statute.<br /></blockquote><br />Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion. He would not have remanded the case to the district court. Justice Antonin Scalia also filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Scalia believes that the plaintiff lacks standing. Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a separate dissent.<br /><br />The dispute concerns a Latin cross on a rock outcropping in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/moja/index.htm">Mojave National Preserve</a> [official website]. The display of the cross on public property had already been found in violation of the Establishment Clause, so the government sought to transfer the portion of land on which the cross was located to a private entity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN Security Council on Tuesday <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc9913.doc.htm">unanimously approved Resolution 1918</a> [press release], calling on member states to criminalize piracy under their domestic laws and urging <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] to consider an international tribunal for prosecuting piracy. In the resolution, the Security Council noted its previous resolutions regarding piracy, particularly <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia+pirate">piracy off the coast of Somalia</a> [JURIST news archive], as well as the continuing security issues posed by piracy. The ineffectual nature of past resolutions, combined with the lack of action by the Somali government and the difficulties faced by Kenya, one of the few African nations to attempt to prosecute piracy, may have led to the inclusion of the request that the secretary-general investigate options for UN prosecution of piracy. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, had <a href="http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=119367">previously proposed</a> [APA report] that the UN establish a special court for Somali pirates. The resolution asks that the Secretary General&#39;s report on prosecutorial options be completed within three months.<br /><br />The Security Council resolution comes the same week the UN announced that a trust fund established to combat piracy will be <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34472&Cr=somali&Cr1=">funding five projects</a> [UN News Centre report] aimed at piracy committed in the waters around Somalia. The same day, unsealed indicments revealed that the US had <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-prosecutors-indict-11-suspected.php">filed charges against 11 Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Earlier this month, Kenya announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kenya-courts-no-longer-accepting.php">no longer accept referred piracy cases</a> [JURIST report], which have overburdened its judicial system, an announcement that may have spurred the Security Council to act. In January, the International Chamber of Commerce released a report indicating that maritime piracy had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">reached its highest levels since 2003</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French judge ruled Tuesday that former Panamanian military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>] must remain in custody until his trial on money laundering charges. Noriega arrived in France Tuesday morning after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. Noriega appeared Tuesday before French prosecutors to hear the charges against him, which stem from allegedly laundering $3 million in drug profits by purchasing property in Paris. He then appeared before a judge to request that he be sent back to Panama immediately. His lawyers argued that he is immune from prosecution as a former head of state and that the statute of limitations has expired. The judge <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/ameriques/article/2010/04/27/manuel-noriega-l-ancien-dictateur-panameen-a-ete-extrade-vers-la-france_1343125_3222.html">rejected those arguments</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French], remanding Noriega into custody.<br /><br />Noriega <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> in February after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January. Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but France agreed to hold a new trial if he was extradited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_04-27-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/april2010.shtml">merit briefs</a>] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-475.pdf">Monsanto Company v. Geertson Seed Farms</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-to-consider-release-of.php">report</a>] on what conditions must be met to obtain a nationwide injunction prohibiting the planting of genetically engineered crops. The case arose over an injunction against the planting of Monsanto&#39;s &quot;Roundup Ready alfalfa,&quot; pending an environmental impact statement. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/06/24/07-16458.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] plaintiffs are specially exempt from the requirement of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to obtain an injunction, affirming the nationwide injunction. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the district court, &quot;short-circuited the requisite inquiry into the likelihood of reparable - irreparable harm, because they reasoned that the agency was going to get into this anyway in the course of preparing its environmental impact statement.&quot; Counsel for respondents argued:<blockquote>In our view Petitioners lack standing to bring this case to this Court. By failing to challenge the lawfulness of the deregulation vacatur either in the Ninth Circuit or in this Court, Petitioners have an insurmountable redressability problem. They cannot get the practical relief they seek even in the event that this Court vacates or narrows the injunction.</blockquote>The case is being closely followed by environmental and industry groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Moscow City Court ruled Tuesday that the Slavic Union (SS) violates Russia&#39;s extremism laws, banning the organization. The SS, whose initials are the same as the Nazi paramilitary, was one of Russia&#39;s largest <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=neo-nazi">neo-Nazi</a> [JURIST news archive] organizations. City prosecutors <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/slavic-union-banned/404968.html">initiated the action</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], accusing the group of promoting nationalistic supremacy similar to the ideology of Nazi Germany.  SS leader Dmitry Dyomushkin says he <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15070953&PageNum=0">plans to appeal the ban</a> [ITAR-TASS report]. He warned that the ban will anger radical ultranationalists into <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/28/AR2010042801804.html">retaliation</a> [AP report].<br /><br />Earlier this month, a Moscow City Court judge known for presiding over cases involving neo-Nazi groups was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/russia-judge-involved-in-neo-nazi.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] while leaving his apartment. Russia is currently struggling to limit hate crimes, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">decreased in 2009</a> [JURIST report] according to the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website]. Last month, the Russian <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] banned Adolf Hitler&#39;s book <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> [Britannica backgrounder], finding it in violation of laws against extremism. In December, the Russian <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/vs_index.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/russia-supreme-court-bans-jehovahs.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to shut down the Taganrog Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and ban the distribution of 34 Jehovah&#39;s Witness publications, finding both the Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and the publications to be extremist. In 2007, the Russian parliament approved legislative amendments to <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">change the prevailing definition of extremist crime</a> [JURIST report] in Russian law to include activities taken for &quot;political or ideological hatred.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian House of Commons Speaker <a href="http://www.petermilliken.org/">Peter Milliken</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.canada.com/pdf/LEE-ruling-2010-04-27-english.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday that members of <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/index.asp?Language=E">Parliament</a> have the right to seek uncensored Afghan detainee documents from the government of <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official websites]. The historic ruling is a significant victory for opposition parties over Harper&#39;s minority Conservative government. In his ruling, Milliken said:<br /><blockquote><br />The Chair must conclude that it is within the powers of the House of Commons to ask for the documents sought in the December 10 order it adopted. Now, it seems to me, that the issue before us is this: is it possible to put into place a mechanism by which these documents could be made available to the House without compromising the security and confidentiality of the information they contain? In other words, is it possible for the two sides, working together in the best interest of the Canadians they serve, to devise a means where both their concerns are met? Surely that is not too much to hope for.<br /></blockquote><br />Milliken gave both sides two weeks to reach a compromise. If no agreement can be reached, members of Harper&#39;s cabinet, including the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and justice, could be held in contempt of Parliament. Although the Harper government has indicated its general willingness to comply with the Speaker&#39;s ruling, it might yet <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/798814--struggle-between-parliament-and-government-could-reach-supreme-court?bn=1">pass the general issue</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] of executive versus legislative authority on to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] as a constitutional reference question for its formal determination.  <br /><br />The release of the detainee documents has been highly controversial. Last month, Canadian <a href="http://www.robnicholsonmp.ca/EN/3302/">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson</a> [official profile] announced that former Supreme Court justice <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/iacobucci/iacobucci.html">Frank Iacobucci</a> [U. Toronto backgrounder] would <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/canada-judge-to-review-afghan-detainee.php">review documents</a> [JURIST report] detailing Canadian forces&#39; handing of Afghan detainees and the terms of their transfer to Afghan authorities before the documents would be released to Parliament. Nicholson indicated that Iacobucci would report back to Nicholson, who would determine the conditions of disclosure. In December, Parliament passed an <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/canadian-opposition-measure-seeks.php">order to compel</a> Harper to release the unredacted documents after the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/canada-government-releases-e-mails.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] more than 40 <a href="http://www.bccla.org/antiterrorissue/ColvinDocs3.pdf">redacted e-mails</a> [text, PDF] sent by Canadian diplomat Richard Colvin to then-foreign minister <a href="http://www.petermackay.ca/meet_peter.php">Peter MacKay</a> [official profile] raising concerns about the torture of transferred detainees. The release of the e-mails came after Colvin <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senior-canada-diplomat-accuses-military.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before a Commons committee in November that all enemy combatants captured in 2006 and 2007 by Canadian forces were likely tortured upon their transfer to Afghan authorities.

His lawyers argued that he has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042701606.html">denied due process</a> [Reuters report] and that the charges are illegal. Bemba was originally set to go on trial on war crimes charges on Tuesday, but the trial was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-postpones-trial-of-congo-rebel.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until July 5 to allow the court more time to consider the defense&#39;s motion on the admissibility of the case, filed in February.<br /><br />In December, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc787666.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] Bemba to <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. The ruling reversed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/icc-orders-conditional-release-of-congo.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] issued in August ordering Bemba&#39;s conditional release. The order for release was opposed by ICC prosecutors who <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/icc-prosecutor-argues-against-release.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the original decision. The ICC has <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icc-orders-congo-rebel-leader-bemba-to.php">ordered Bemba to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes allegedly committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder] from October 2002 to May 2003. Bemba was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Belgium in May 2008 after the ICC issued a warrant for his arrest for his actions in the CAR. He was indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/belgium-court-transfers-former-congo.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC in July 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Japanese Diet on Tuesday approved a bill abolishing the statute of limitations for murder. The new law abolishes the statute of limitations for serious capital crimes, which was previously 25 years, and <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T100427005366.htm">extends</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Yomiuri</span> report] the limitation period for sexual assault and other crimes resulting in death from 15 to 30 years. The law also doubles prison terms for other crimes resulting in death. Japanese Justice Minister Keiko Chiba <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100428a4.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+japantimes+%28The+Japan+Times%3A+All+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader">utilized the new law</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kyodo News</span> report] Tuesday to keep open an unsolved case from 1995 that was set to expire at midnight. While criminal procedure laws are normally not enacted for at least a week while they are reviewed by the emperor prior to publication, this law was enforced immediately to keep unsolved cases open.<br /><br />Japan has recently taken steps to reform its criminal procedure system. Last year, Japan <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/japan-court-reaches-guilty-verdict-in.php">held its first jury trial</a> [JURIST report] since the end of World War II, with the <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/tokyo/">Tokyo District Court</a> [official website, in Japanese] convicting Katsuyoshi Fujii of murder. In 2004, the National Diet enacted the <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_06.1_anderson.pdf">Lay Assessor Act</a> [materials, PDF; Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/issues/issues03.html">backgrounder</a>], which impanels professional and lay judges to decide and sentence capital cases and cases involving an intentional death. Panels can be made up of three professional judges and six lay judges or one professional judge and four lay judges. For their verdicts to stand, lay judges need the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8188447.stm">concurrence</a> [BBC report] of at least one professional judge.

The ban was originally implemented under the <a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/29/content_27332.htm">Frontier Health and Quarantine Law</a> and the <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/travel/2008-01/03/content_1225538.htm">Law on Control of the Entry and Exit of Aliens</a> [texts], both passed in 1987. The ban had temporarily been lifted for international events, such as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, but the inconvenience that resulted, as well as the increased knowledge of how HIV/AIDS is spread, were reasons cited by the government as factors for changing the law. China&#39;s action <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/Resources/PressCentre/PressReleases/2010/20100427_PS_China_travel_restrictions.asp">drew praise</a> [press release] from the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/">Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> [official website], which urged the 51 countries and areas that still bar entry to individuals with HIV/AIDS to follow China&#39;s lead in overturning their bans. The lifting of the ban does not enjoy widespread support from Chinese civilians, however, with 84 percent supporting <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-04/01/content_9671854.htm">keeping the ban in place</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">China Daily</span> report].

<p>Until recently, the US was one of the nations with an entry ban for individuals with HIV/AIDS. That <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/us-hivaids-travel-ban-lifted.php">ban was lifted in January</a> [JURIST report] when the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a> [official website] removed HIV/AIDS from its list of communicable diseases of public significance. It was first reported in late November that China was <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/11/china-considering-lifting-ban-on.php">considering lifting the entry ban</a> [JURIST report], ahead of the Shanghai Expo scheduled for May of this year. China had previously <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/11/china-to-relax-entry-prohibition.php">relaxed its restrictions on entry</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the documents were previously available to historians, political officials, and victims&#39; families, this is the first time that copies of the original documents have been made available to the general public. Russian <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] chose to make the documents public as relations between Russian and Poland have apparently improved following the April 10 <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">plane crash</a> [JURIST report] that killed Poland&#39;s president. Among the documents is a 1940 note signed by Joseph Stalin ordering the execution of Polish &quot;nationalists and counter-revolutionaries.&quot;

<p>The 1940 killings have long been a point of tension between the two governments, with Russia originally blaming the Nazis and only acknowledging responsibility in 1990. In February, the Polish government <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/poland-government-joins-suit-against.php">joined a class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Russia filed in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] by 13 Polish citizens who are relatives of the victims. In January 2009, victims&#39; relatives were <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/01/russia-high-court-rejects-appeal-in.php">denied an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/">Russian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] to reopen investigations into the killings. The court reasoned that the Soviet-era criminal code to be applied to the killings places a 10-year statute of limitations on the proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Counsel for the petitioners argued that, &quot;[n]o person should suffer harassment for participating in our political system, and the First Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs and their private associations.&quot; Counsel for the state of Washington argued that the names can be made public. The court appeared skeptical of petitioners&#39; arguments, with Justice Antonin Scalia saying &quot;[d]emocracy requires a certain amount of civic courage.&quot;]]></content:encoded>

Henry believes that the proposed legislation would &quot;endanger citizens and law enforcement officers&quot; by abolishing &quot;common sense regulations&quot; like background checks and giving criminals easy access to a wide array of weapons. Henry also cited constitutional concerns. Because there is no way to ensure that Oklahoma-manufactured weapons will remain in the state, Henry said that the proposed legislation would likely be seen as violating the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and would therefore be declared unconstitutional if it were challenged in court. State Senator Randy Brogdon, an advocate for the bill,  said that he was <a href="http://oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_2010/pr20100427epv.html">disappointed</a> [press release] to learn that Henry had vetoed the legislation. Brogdon challenged Henry&#39;s assertions that the law would give criminals easy access to firearms and went on to claim that the legislation would actually have &quot;stopped further federal attempts to erode our Constitutional right to protect ourselves and our families.&quot; It remains to be seen whether supporters of the bill in the state senate will garner the necessary support to override the veto. 

<p>The rights of states and municipalities to regulate firearms under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution have become controversial. Last month, a federal judge ruled that firearms <a href="http://www.dcwatch.com/council17/17-886.htm">regulations</a> [text] in Washington, DC, including a ban on assault weapons and a prohibition on <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/saws-and-lcafds.html#lcafd-ban">large capacity ammunition feeding devices</a> [ATF backgrounder], do <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">not violate the Second Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In upholding the regulations, the judge cited the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report], which struck down an outright ban on handgun ownership in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court recently <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-gun.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] to determine whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the states, and not just the District of Columbia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noriega faces charges of human rights violations in Panama for crimes allegedly committed during his 1981-1989 rule. He was convicted on three counts of human rights violations <i>in absentia</i>, and each count carries a 20-year prison sentence. Panama&#39;s Vice President and Foreign Affairs Minister <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-vicepresidente.html">Juan Carlos Varela</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said Wednesday that his office will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hzvCxA8W4FbbCMf1j47pEG2rrozw">write to the judicial branch</a> [AFP report], which must make the extradition request.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a French judge ruled that Noriega must <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/france-judge-orders-noriega-to-remain.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. Noriega arrived in France Tuesday morning after being <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. He had <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> in February after the Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January. Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but France agreed to hold a new trial if he was extradited.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was brought by three women whose husbands&#39; names appear on the <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolist.shtml">UN list of terror suspects</a> [materials] that have been linked to al Qaeda, the Taliban, or Osama bin Laden, resulting in their assets being frozen pursuant to an EU regulation. Under a regime established by the UK <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/">Treasury</a> [official website] in 2006, terror suspects&#39; spouses could only receive government benefits under <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/apr/29/terror-suspects-family-benefits">certain conditions</a> [<i>Guardian</i> report], including withdrawing only 10 pounds in cash for each family member, sending a detailed monthly expense list and receipts to the Treasury, and accepting that giving cash to their husbands would be a criminal offense. The ECJ struck down the Treasury&#39;s interpretation of the EU rules, finding that it does not fulfill the purpose of combating international terrorism. The case will now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8651066.stm">return</a> [BBC report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] for a final ruling.

<p>In January, the UK Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/uk-supreme-court-rules-orders-freezing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that executive orders allowing the government to freeze the assets of five suspected terrorists are illegal. The men involved in the court&#39;s <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/uk-supreme-court-hears-inaugural-case.php">inaugural case</a> [JURIST report] argued that the government exceeded its power when the Treasury froze their assets without the approval of Parliament. The Supreme Court&#39;s ruling affirmed a 2008 High Court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/04/uk-high-court-rules-terror-suspect.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], which found that the Treasury may not freeze the assets of the five suspected terrorists without the approval of Parliament. The seizures were conducted pursuant to two <a href="http://www.privycouncil.gov.uk/output/page534.asp">Orders in Council</a> [backgrounder], the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062657.htm">Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</a> and the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062952.htm">Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures] Order 2006</a> [texts]. The orders implemented UN resolutions requiring UN member states to freeze the assets of people on the UN list of suspected terrorists. The High Court rejected the orders because they were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny before they came into force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During his imprisonment on those immigration-related charges, ICE worked with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] to investigate Boskic&#39;s alleged role at Srebrenica. Depending on the severity of Boskic&#39;s role, he will be tried either in the ICTY or the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">BiH war crimes court</a> [official website].

<p>Last week, the BiH war crimes court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-31-years-for.php">convicted two individuals</a> [JURIST report], Radomir Vukovic and Zoran Tomic, for their roles in the Srebrenica massacre, sentencing each to 31 years in prison. In March, the court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">indicted a former Serbian police commander</a>, Nedjo Ikonic, for his alleged role at Srebrenica. The BiH war crimes court was originally formed in 2005 to relieve the caseload of the ICTY, and retains jurisdiction over crimes considered to be of a lower level, while the ICTY hears high-level cases, such as those involving <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive].

State Senator Randy Brogdon, an advocate for the bill,  said that he was <a href="http://oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_2010/pr20100427epv.html">disappointed</a> [press release] to learn that Henry had vetoed the legislation. Brogdon challenged Henry&#39;s assertions that the law would give criminals easy access to firearms and went on to claim that the legislation would actually have &quot;stopped further federal attempts to erode our Constitutional right to protect ourselves and our families.&quot; It remains to be seen whether supporters of the bill in the state senate will garner the necessary support to override the veto. <br /><br />The rights of states and municipalities to regulate firearms under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution have become controversial. Last month, a federal judge ruled that firearms <a href="http://www.dcwatch.com/council17/17-886.htm">regulations</a> [text] in Washington, DC, including a ban on assault weapons and a prohibition on <a href="http://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/saws-and-lcafds.html#lcafd-ban">large capacity ammunition feeding devices</a> [ATF backgrounder], do <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">not violate the Second Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In upholding the regulations, the judge cited the 2008 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report], which struck down an outright ban on handgun ownership in Washington, DC. The Supreme Court recently <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-gun.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. City of Chicago</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] to determine whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms applies to the states, and not just the District of Columbia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of Senate Democrats on Thursday introduced <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/archives/DISCLOSE_Act.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] aimed at curbing foreign and corporate influence in elections after a recent <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">eased restrictions on campaign spending</a> [JURIST report]. In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], the Supreme Court struck down Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. According to a <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/new_website/record.cfm?id=324343">press release</a> [text], the legislation, entitled the DISCLOSE Act, seeks to:<br /><blockquote><br />partly restore those limits - by barring foreign-controlled corporations, government contractors and companies that have received government assistance from making political expenditures - and also require corporations, unions, and other organizations that make political expenditures to disclose their donors and stand by their ads.<br /></blockquote><br />The lawmakers hope to pass the DISCLOSE Act by July 4 so that it will take effect for the 2010 elections.<br /><br />US President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/white-house-presses-critique-of-high.php">sharply criticized</a> the Supreme Court&#39;s holding in <u>Citizens United</u>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">most notably</a> [JURIST reports] in this year&#39;s State of the Union speech. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] on the effects of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US subcommittee heard testimony Wednesday on the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drone">unmanned predator drone strikes</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4450&Itemid=19">National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee</a> of the House <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official websites] held a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4903:hearing-on-the-rise-of-the-drones-ii-examining-the-legality-of-unmanned-targeting&catid=72:hearings&Itemid=30">hearing</a> [materials] on the legality of unmanned targeting. In his <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/subcommittees/NS_Subcommittee/4.28.10_Drones_II/Opening_Statement.pdf">opening remarks</a> [text, PDF], subcommittee chair John Tierney (D-MA) [official website] said:<br /><blockquote><br />The use of unmanned weapons to target individuals - and, for that matter, the targeting of individuals in general - raises many complex legal questions. We must examine who can be a legitimate target, where that person can be legally targeted, and when the risk of collateral damage is too high. We must ask whether it makes a difference if the military carries out an attack, or whether other government entities such as the Central Intelligence Agency may legally conduct such attacks. We must ensure that the Administration&#39;s understanding of the authorities granted to it by Congress do not exceed what Congress intended.<br /></blockquote><br />The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) [advocacy website], which has consistently opposed the use of unmanned targeting, sent a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/subcommittees/NS_Subcommittee/4.28.10_Drones_II/2010_04_28_ACLU_ADR_Letter_to_President_Obama.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to President Barack Obama Wednesday, urging an end to the program.<br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department Legal Adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">defended the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the use of unmanned drones. Earlier in March, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-information-on.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] seeking information related to the US government&#39;s use of unmanned drones. The ACLU alleges that the drones have been used by the military and CIA for unlawful killings in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The ACLU also cites troubling reports indicating that US citizens may be targeted and killed by unmanned drones. In October, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] noted that the use of unmanned drones by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Alston said, &quot;[t]he onus is really on the government of the United States to reveal more about the ways in which it makes sure that arbitrary executions, extrajudicial executions, are not in fact being carried out through the use of these weapons.&quot; Alston criticized the US policy in a report to the UN General Assembly&#39;s human rights committee that was presented as part of a larger demand that no state be free from accountability.

Suu Kyi is asking the court to annul the part of the election law that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-junta-announces-new-election.php">bars political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] from participating in elections, and also to establish a parliament of lawmakers who won in the 1990 elections. The NLD also filed a similar suit. If the NLD does not re-register by May 6, it may face dissolution.<br /><br />Last month, the NLD <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-opposition-party-boycotting.php">announced</a> that it would not take part in the nation&#39;s first elections in 20 years after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-high-court-rejects-suu-kyi.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] a lawsuit brought by the NLD to repeal the election laws preventing Suu Kyi from participating. Myanmar also faced a bevy of criticism during the month of March, with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopting a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=10&se=104&t=4">resolution</a> [A/HRC/13/L.15 materials] condemning the country for rights violations and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-resolution-urges-fair-myanmar.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] the ruling junta to conduct fair and free elections. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] said that Myanmar&#39;s election laws <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/myanmar-election-laws-do-not-meet.php">do not meet international standards</a> [JURIST report], and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/10/burma-election-laws-may-shut-down-opposition-parties">said</a> [press release] &quot;[the new law] continues the sham political process that is aimed at creating the appearance of civilian rule with a military spine.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government on Thursday revised its often-criticized <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+state+secrets">state secrets</a> [JURIST news archive] law to require Internet and telecommunications companies to inform on customers who share state secrets. This new provision may <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d7944740-537d-11df-bfdf-00144feab49a.html">provide a disincentive</a> [FT report] to many service providers from entering China, particularly when considered along with China&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7312746.stm">Internet filtering laws</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The new law also <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/29/c_13272939.htm">narrows the definition</a> [Xinhua report] of state secrets. As approved by parliament, the phrase state secrets now means, &quot;information concerning state security and interests and, if leaked, would damage state security and interests in the areas of politics, economy and national defense.&quot; The amended state secrets law will take effect in October.<br /><br />China&#39;s state secrets law has frequently been criticized for the breadth of action which falls under the doctrine. In November 2009, rights activist Huang Qi was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-human-rights-activist-huang-qi.php">sentenced to three years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for violating the state secrets law, when he discussed how some schools collapsed after the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2008/china_quake/default.stm">Sichuan province earthquake</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2008 because of shoddy construction.

Chaos broke out Tuesday as lawmakers <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=243389294&cat_id=243321034">approved a treaty</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] that will extend Russia&#39;s lease on a naval base in the Ukrainian Sevastopol port on the Black Sea until 2042 in exchange for discounted Russian gas. The agreement was strongly opposed by pro-Western lawmakers who threw eggs and smoke bombs at the speaker in an attempt to stop the vote. Despite the pandemonium, the measure passed with 236 votes in the 450-member parliament, and the treaty was signed into law Thursday. Prosecutors said that those responsible for the mayhem could face <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/04/29/ukraine-parliament-charges-port-deal.html">charges of hooliganism</a> [CBC report], which carries a penalty of four years imprisonment.<br /><br />The treaty comes soon after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-challenging.php">election</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], who took office in February. Yanukovych replaced <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko">Viktor Yushchenko</a> [JURIST news archive], who had sought to cut ties with Russia and strengthen relationships with Western Europe. Yushchenko opposed the extension of Russia&#39;s Black Sea lease.

The case arose over an order to publish the names of those who signed a Washington state petition to overturn a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/washington-passes-bill-expanding-rights.php">state law</a> [JURIST report] giving same-sex partners the same rights as married partners. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/28/09-35818.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the names should be released, but the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-blocks-release-of-names.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] in October. Counsel for the petitioners argued that, &quot;[n]o person should suffer harassment for participating in our political system, and the First Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs and their private associations.&quot; Counsel for the state of Washington argued that the names can be made public. The court appeared skeptical of petitioners&#39; arguments, with Justice Antonin Scalia saying &quot;[d]emocracy requires a certain amount of civic courage.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian government on Wednesday <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/sdocs/news.shtml#225676">made public</a> [press release] <a href="http://rusarchives.ru/publication/katyn/spisok.shtml">documents</a> [materials, in Russian] relating to the 1940 <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/313393/Katyn-Massacre">Katyn Massacre</a> [Britannica backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=katyn">news archive</a>] in which 20,000 Poles were killed by the USSR. While the documents were previously available to historians, political officials, and victims&#39; families, this is the first time that copies of the original documents have been made available to the general public. Russian <a href="http://news.kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] chose to make the documents public as relations between Russian and Poland have apparently improved following the April 10 <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/poland-lower-house-speaker-assumes.php">plane crash</a> [JURIST report] that killed Poland&#39;s president. Among the documents is a 1940 note signed by Joseph Stalin ordering the execution of Polish &quot;nationalists and counter-revolutionaries.&quot;<br /><br />The 1940 killings have long been a point of tension between the two governments, with Russia originally blaming the Nazis and only acknowledging responsibility in 1990. In February, the Polish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/poland-government-joins-suit-against.php">joined a class-action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Russia filed in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] by 13 Polish citizens who are relatives of the victims. In January 2009, victims&#39; relatives were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-high-court-rejects-appeal-in.php">denied an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/">Russian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] to reopen investigations into the killings. The court reasoned that the Soviet-era criminal code to be applied to the killings places a 10-year statute of limitations on the proceedings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Bureau of <a href="http://www.ice.gov/index.htm">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/1004/100427washingtondc2.htm">removed</a> [press release] accused <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive] criminal Marko Boskic to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Boskic will stand trial in Sarajevo for his role in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] in 1995, where 1,200 unarmed prisoners of war were killed. Boskic was first <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/08/27/war_crimes_suspect_charged_in_boston/">arrested</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span> report] in the US in 2004, when immigration officials charged him with fraud and misuse of a visa for not reporting his foreign military service. During his imprisonment on those immigration-related charges, ICE worked with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] to investigate Boskic&#39;s alleged role at Srebrenica. Depending on the severity of Boskic&#39;s role, he will be tried either in the ICTY or the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">BiH war crimes court</a> [official website].<br /><br />Last week, the BiH war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-31-years-for.php">convicted two individuals</a> [JURIST report], Radomir Vukovic and Zoran Tomic, for their roles in the Srebrenica massacre, sentencing each to 31 years in prison. In March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">indicted a former Serbian police commander</a>, Nedjo Ikonic, for his alleged role at Srebrenica. The BiH war crimes court was originally formed in 2005 to relieve the caseload of the ICTY, and retains jurisdiction over crimes considered to be of a lower level, while the ICTY hears high-level cases, such as those involving <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive]. The BiH war crimes court handed down its first decision in 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said Wednesday that his government will seek the extradition of former military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>], currently being held in France on money laundering charges. Noriega faces charges of human rights violations in Panama for crimes allegedly committed during his 1981-1989 rule. He was convicted on three counts of human rights violations <em>in absentia</em>, and each count carries a 20-year prison sentence. Panama&#39;s Vice President and Foreign Affairs Minister <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-vicepresidente.html">Juan Carlos Varela</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said Wednesday that his office will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hzvCxA8W4FbbCMf1j47pEG2rrozw">write to the judicial branch</a> [AFP report], which must make the extradition request.<br /><br />Earlier this week, a French judge ruled that Noriega must <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-judge-orders-noriega-to-remain.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. Noriega arrived in France Tuesday morning after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. He had <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. His lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/noriega-asks-supreme-court-to.php">filed the petition</a> in February after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-noriega.php">denied <span style="font-style:italic;">certiorari</span></a> [JURIST reports] on the case in January. Noriega, who has been declared a prisoner of war, sought to enforce a provision of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder] that requires repatriation at the end of confinement. Noriega and his wife were <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced in absentia</a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but France agreed to hold a new trial if he was extradited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-340/08">ruled</a> [materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2010-04/cp100041en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] Thursday that the UK may not restrict government benefits to the spouses and families of suspected terrorists. The challenge was brought by three women whose husbands&#39; names appear on the <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/consolist.shtml">UN list of terror suspects</a> [materials] that have been linked to al Qaeda, the Taliban, or Osama bin Laden, resulting in their assets being frozen pursuant to an EU regulation. Under a regime established by the UK <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/">Treasury</a> [official website] in 2006, terror suspects&#39; spouses could only receive government benefits under <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/apr/29/terror-suspects-family-benefits">certain conditions</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], including withdrawing only 10 pounds in cash for each family member, sending a detailed monthly expense list and receipts to the Treasury, and accepting that giving cash to their husbands would be a criminal offense. The ECJ struck down the Treasury&#39;s interpretation of the EU rules, finding that it does not fulfill the purpose of combating international terrorism. The case will now <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8651066.stm">return</a> [BBC report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] for a final ruling.<br /><br />In January, the UK Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/uk-supreme-court-rules-orders-freezing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that executive orders allowing the government to freeze the assets of five suspected terrorists are illegal. The men involved in the court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uk-supreme-court-hears-inaugural-case.php">inaugural case</a> [JURIST report] argued that the government exceeded its power when the Treasury froze their assets without the approval of Parliament. The Supreme Court&#39;s ruling affirmed a 2008 High Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-high-court-rules-terror-suspect.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], which found that the Treasury may not freeze the assets of the five suspected terrorists without the approval of Parliament. The seizures were conducted pursuant to two <a href="http://www.privycouncil.gov.uk/output/page534.asp">Orders in Council</a> [backgrounder], the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062657.htm">Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006</a> and the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20062952.htm">Al Qaeda and Taliban (United Nations Measures] Order 2006</a> [texts]. The orders implemented UN resolutions requiring UN member states to freeze the assets of people on the UN list of suspected terrorists. The High Court rejected the orders because they were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny before they came into force.

The SS, whose initials are the same as the Nazi paramilitary, was one of Russia&#39;s largest <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=neo-nazi">neo-Nazi</a> [JURIST news archive] organizations. City prosecutors <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/slavic-union-banned/404968.html">initiated the action</a> [<i>Moscow Times</i> report], accusing the group of promoting nationalistic supremacy similar to the ideology of Nazi Germany.  SS leader Dmitry Dyomushkin says he <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=15070953&PageNum=0">plans to appeal the ban</a> [ITAR-TASS report]. He warned that the ban will anger radical ultranationalists into <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/28/AR2010042801804.html">retaliation</a> [AP report].

<p>Earlier this month, a Moscow City Court judge known for presiding over cases involving neo-Nazi groups was <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/russia-judge-involved-in-neo-nazi.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] while leaving his apartment. Russia is currently struggling to limit hate crimes, which <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/russia-hate-crimes-decrease-in-2009.php">decreased in 2009</a> [JURIST report] according to the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468/">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website]. Last month, the Russian <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] banned Adolf Hitler&#39;s book <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> [Britannica backgrounder], finding it in violation of laws against extremism. In December, the Russian <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/vs_index.php">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/12/russia-supreme-court-bans-jehovahs.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to shut down the Taganrog Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and ban the distribution of 34 Jehovah&#39;s Witness publications, finding both the Jehovah&#39;s Witness congregation and the publications to be extremist. In 2007, the Russian parliament approved legislative amendments to <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">change the prevailing definition of extremist crime</a> [JURIST report] in Russian law to include activities taken for &quot;political or ideological hatred.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4450&Itemid=19">National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee</a> of the House <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official websites] held a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4903:hearing-on-the-rise-of-the-drones-ii-examining-the-legality-of-unmanned-targeting&catid=72:hearings&Itemid=30">hearing</a> [materials] on the legality of unmanned targeting. In his <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/subcommittees/NS_Subcommittee/4.28.10_Drones_II/Opening_Statement.pdf">opening remarks</a> [text, PDF], subcommittee chair John Tierney (D-MA) [official website] said:<blockquote>The use of unmanned weapons to target individuals - and, for that matter, the targeting of individuals in general - raises many complex legal questions. We must examine who can be a legitimate target, where that person can be legally targeted, and when the risk of collateral damage is too high. We must ask whether it makes a difference if the military carries out an attack, or whether other government entities such as the Central Intelligence Agency may legally conduct such attacks. We must ensure that the Administration&#39;s understanding of the authorities granted to it by Congress do not exceed what Congress intended.</blockquote>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) [advocacy website], which has consistently opposed the use of unmanned targeting, sent a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/subcommittees/NS_Subcommittee/4.28.10_Drones_II/2010_04_28_ACLU_ADR_Letter_to_President_Obama.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to President Barack Obama Wednesday, urging an end to the program.

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department Legal Adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">defended the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the use of unmanned drones. Earlier in March, the ACLU <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-information-on.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] seeking information related to the US government&#39;s use of unmanned drones. The ACLU alleges that the drones have been used by the military and CIA for unlawful killings in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The ACLU also cites troubling reports indicating that US citizens may be targeted and killed by unmanned drones. In October, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] noted that the use of unmanned drones by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Alston said, &quot;[t]he onus is really on the government of the United States to reveal more about the ways in which it makes sure that arbitrary executions, extrajudicial executions, are not in fact being carried out through the use of these weapons.&quot; Alston criticized the US policy in a report to the UN General Assembly&#39;s human rights committee that was presented as part of a larger demand that no state be free from accountability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>China&#39;s state secrets law has frequently been criticized for the breadth of action which falls under the doctrine.

The <a href="http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=/flwb&language=fr&rightmenu=right&cfm=flwbn.cfm?lang=F&legislat=52&dossierID=2289">proposed legislation</a> [materials, in French] applies to areas &quot;accessible to the public&quot; or areas meant for &quot;public use or to provide public services.&quot; Violators could face a penalty of up to seven days in jail or a fine of 15 to 25 euros. Proponents argue that the legislation is necessary both as a security measure and to prevent women from being forced to wear the garments. Opponents have said that the bill restricts freedom of expression. The measure must now go before the <a href="http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&LANG=fr">Senate</a> [official website, in French]. If approved, Belgium would become the first European nation to impose a nationwide restriction on traditional face-covering veils.

<p>France, which has Europe&#39;s largest Muslim population, has also been pressing for a ban on the burqa. Last week, a spokesperson for French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">BBC profile</a>] said that the president is in favor of a complete public ban on the burqa and other full face veils and will be submitting a bill to parliament in May. Last month, the French Council of State <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/france-council-advises-against-full.php">advised the French government against a complete ban</a> [JURIST report] on full Islamic veils because it risks violating the French Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. France already has a partial ban that prevents public officials from wearing veils while operating in their official capacity and also prohibits veils in public schools. Also last month, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/785036--quebec-niqab-bill-makes-women-unveil-to-get-public-services">lawmakers in Quebec introduced a bill</a> [<i>Star</i> report] that would ban women from wearing full face veils from public services, which garnered support from members of the Muslim Canadian Congress who argue that the law would <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2010/02/canada-should-consider-burka-ban-as.php">not violate human rights</a> [JURIST comment] and would promote the ideals of a free and democratic society.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], the Supreme Court struck down Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an &quot;electioneering communication&quot; or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. According to a <a href="http://schumer.senate.gov/new_website/record.cfm?id=324343">press release</a> [text], the legislation, entitled the DISCLOSE Act, seeks to:<blockquote>partly restore those limits - by barring foreign-controlled corporations, government contractors and companies that have received government assistance from making political expenditures - and also require corporations, unions, and other organizations that make political expenditures to disclose their donors and stand by their ads.</blockquote>The lawmakers hope to pass the DISCLOSE Act by July 4 so that it will take effect for the 2010 elections.

<p>US President Barack Obama has <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/white-house-presses-critique-of-high.php">sharply criticized</a> the Supreme Court&#39;s holding in <u>Citizens United</u>, <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/obama-chides-supreme-court-again-in.php">most notably</a> [JURIST reports] in this year&#39;s State of the Union speech. Obama warned of the increased potential for powerful interest groups, both foreign and domestic, to wield excessive influence over American elections and called for bipartisan support of legislation to counteract the decision. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/senate-committee-hears-testimony-on.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] on the effects of the <u>Citizens United</u> decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arizona police officer Martin Escobar <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30717024/Escobar-v-Brewer">filed suit</a> [complaint text] in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website], alleging that <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1070</a> [materials] is unconstitutional and could hamper police investigations. A second suit was filed by the <a href="http://www.conlamic.org/">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> (CONLAMIC) [advocacy website], which argues that the legislation is preempted by federal law. Also Thursday, several advocacy groups, including the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF), the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), and the <a href="http://nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] formally <a href="http://maldef.org/news/releases/maldef_aclu_nilc_announce_04292010/">announced their intention to challenge</a> [press release] the bill. 

<p>The bill, <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last week by Governor Jan Brewer, has caused intense controversy. Earlier this week, Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, Spanish] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/mexico-president-criticizes-arizona.php">strongly criticized</a> [JURIST report] Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, claiming that the measure opens the door to intolerance and hatred. US President Barack Obama has also <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/obama-criticizes-proposed-arizona.php">criticized the law</a> [JURIST report], calling for federal immigration reform. Under the law, it is designated a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F9G7TG0">crime</a> [AP report] to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/29/Scarf%20Suit.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in August by the <a href="http://www.cair.com/Home.aspx">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] on behalf of Raneen Albaghdady against Judge William Callahan of the Wayne County Circuit Court. Callahan has a policy against hats in his courtroom, and when he asked Albaghdady to remove her headscarf, or hijab, she did so without objection. Judge Marianne Battani ruled:<blockquote>This is not a situation where a government actor required removal of a hijab after the wearer asserted her First Amendment rights. There simply is no evidence that Callahan would have required the removal of a head covering if he had known of its religious significance. Although an individual present in the courtroom stated it was a scarf, no one mentioned it was a hijab. No one mentioned that removal would violate Albaghdady&#39;s religious beliefs. Plaintiffs lacks standing given the facts and circumstances upon which Albaghdady bases her claims. Because Plaintiffs lack standing, the Court dismisses this action in its entirety.</blockquote>CAIR is <a href="http://www.detnews.com/article/20100429/METRO/4290469/1409/METRO08">considering filing an appeal</a> [<i>Detroit News</i> report].

<p>In August, the <a href="http://courts.michigan.gov/SUPREMECOURT/">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued an <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/pdf/miscappearanceorder.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] permitting lower courts to use &quot;reasonable control&quot; over the appearance of those who arrive in court, effectively <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/08/michigan-supreme-court-issues-order.php">allowing judges to ban certain religious clothing</a> [JURIST report]. The court amended the <a href="http://coa.courts.mi.gov/rules/documents/2MichiganRulesOfEvidence.pdf">Michigan Rules of Evidence</a> [text, PDF], motivated by the 2006 case of Ginnah Muhammad. Muhammad had filed a suit in a Michigan small claims court where she was asked by Judge Paul Paruk to remove her <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=niqab">niqab</a> [JURIST news archive], a form of veil, so he could gauge her veracity. Muhammad refused, saying she would not take off her veil in front of a male judge, and her case was dismissed. Muhammad filed a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/03/muslim-woman-sues-michigan-judge-who.php">federal lawsuit</a> over the incident that was eventually <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] in 2008. Also in 2008, a Muslim woman in Georgia was <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-jails-muslim-woman-for.php">arrested and ordered to serve 10 days in jail</a> [JURIST report] for contempt of court after she refused to remove her headscarf, upon entering a security checkpoint in an Atlanta courtroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noriega currently awaits trial in France on money laundering charges. Justice Ministry spokesperson Guillaume Didier said that Noriega will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gODl19SGLO7Ov9_Wu46K03st3jCg">not be treated as a POW</a> [AFP report] because the charges are based on breaches of common law not related to military service. Being treated as a POW would entitle Noriega to special treatment under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder], but Guillaume says conditions of French prisons are consistent with the requirements of the Geneva Conventions regardless. Noriega was already <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced <span style="font-style: italic;">in absentia</span></a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but under French law is entitled to a new trial. 

<p>Earlier this week, Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said that his government will seek the Noriega&#39;s <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">extradition</a> [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama. Also this week, a French judge ruled that Noriega must <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/france-judge-orders-noriega-to-remain.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. Noriega arrived in France Tuesday morning after being <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. He had <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. The US State Department had indicated that it was satisfied that <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2007/09/france-will-treat-noriega-as-pow-after.php">France will treat Noriega as a POW</a> [JURIST report] if Noriega was extradited to that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two lawsuits were filed Tuesday challenging Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, which makes it a crime to be an undocumented immigrant and requires police to question anyone whose immigration status appears suspect. Arizona police officer Martin Escobar <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/30717024/Escobar-v-Brewer">filed suit</a> [complaint text] in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website], alleging that <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1070</a> [materials] is unconstitutional and could hamper police investigations. A second suit was filed by the <a href="http://www.conlamic.org/">National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders</a> (CONLAMIC) [advocacy website], which argues that the legislation is preempted by federal law. Also Thursday, several advocacy groups, including the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF), the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), and the <a href="http://nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] formally <a href="http://maldef.org/news/releases/maldef_aclu_nilc_announce_04292010/">announced their intention to challenge</a> [press release] the bill. <br /><br />The bill, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last week by Governor Jan Brewer, has caused intense controversy. Earlier this week, Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/mexico-president-criticizes-arizona.php">strongly criticized</a> [JURIST report] Arizona&#39;s new immigration law, claiming that the measure opens the door to intolerance and hatred. US President Barack Obama has also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/obama-criticizes-proposed-arizona.php">criticized the law</a> [JURIST report], calling for federal immigration reform. Under the law, it is designated a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i4nY72M0hFVOHUzIrqYpD67DoBxgD9F9G7TG0">crime</a> [AP report] to be in the country illegally, and immigrants unable to verify their legal status could be arrested and jailed for six months and fined $2,500.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Pennsylvania judge Michael Conahan pleaded guilty Thursday on charges of accepting more than $2.6 million in kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which he had a financial interest. The former president judge of the <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/pa/20100430_Ex-judge_pleads_guilty_in_Luzerne__kids-for-cash__scandal.html">pleaded guilty</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia Inquirer</span> report] to one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years. Conahan also faces a fine of no more than $250,000 and disbarment. He will be sentenced by Judge Edwin Kosik of the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], who previously <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/25judge.html?_r=2">rejected</a> [NYT report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and former judge Mark Ciavarella Jr., finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. An attorney for Ciavarella said that he plans to go to trial.<br /><br />As part of an ongoing public corruption investigation, US Attorney Dennis Pfannenschmidt announced earlier this month that a twenty-eighth person has been <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/pam/press_releases/Reilly_04_16_10.htm">charged</a> [press release] with soliciting and receiving bribes and gratuities in connection with the scandal. <a href="http://www.luzernecounty.org/county/row_offices/district_attorney">Luzerne County District Attorney Jacqueline Musto Carroll</a> [official website] agreed in January to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pennsylvania-prosecutor-will-not-retry.php">drop efforts to retry</a> 46 juveniles whose original convictions were <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">overturned</a> [JURIST reports] because they had been issued by a judge indicted on federal corruption charges for an alleged kickback scheme. This decision ended all efforts at retrying any of the convicted juveniles, who will now have their juvenile records cleared. The Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.jlc.org/news/31/no_retrials/">statement</a> [press release] applauding the decision, indicating that &quot;justice has finally been attained&quot; for the juveniles. In October, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/default.htm">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] overturned about 6,500 convictions handed down by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, but gave prosecutors permission to seek retrial of more than 100 youths who were still under court supervision. Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">guilty pleas</a> [JURIST reports] they entered in February 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/29/Scarf%20Dismiss.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion and order, PDF] a lawsuit against a Michigan judge who ordered a Muslim woman to remove her <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=headscarf">headscarf</a> [JURIST news archive] in court. The <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/29/Scarf%20Suit.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in August by the <a href="http://www.cair.com/Home.aspx">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] on behalf of Raneen Albaghdady against Judge William Callahan of the Wayne County Circuit Court. Callahan has a policy against hats in his courtroom, and when he asked Albaghdady to remove her headscarf, or hijab, she did so without objection. Judge Marianne Battani ruled:<br /><blockquote><br />This is not a situation where a government actor required removal of a hijab after the wearer asserted her First Amendment rights. There simply is no evidence that Callahan would have required the removal of a head covering if he had known of its religious significance. Although an individual present in the courtroom stated it was a scarf, no one mentioned it was a hijab. No one mentioned that removal would violate Albaghdady&#39;s religious beliefs. Plaintiffs lacks standing given the facts and circumstances upon which Albaghdady bases her claims. Because Plaintiffs lack standing, the Court dismisses this action in its entirety.<br /></blockquote><br />CAIR is <a href="http://www.detnews.com/article/20100429/METRO/4290469/1409/METRO08">considering filing an appeal</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report].<br /><br />In August, the <a href="http://courts.michigan.gov/SUPREMECOURT/">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] issued an <a href="/pdf/miscappearanceorder.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] permitting lower courts to use &quot;reasonable control&quot; over the appearance of those who arrive in court, effectively <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/michigan-supreme-court-issues-order.php">allowing judges to ban certain religious clothing</a> [JURIST report]. The court amended the <a href="http://coa.courts.mi.gov/rules/documents/2MichiganRulesOfEvidence.pdf">Michigan Rules of Evidence</a> [text, PDF], motivated by the 2006 case of Ginnah Muhammad. Muhammad had filed a suit in a Michigan small claims court where she was asked by Judge Paul Paruk to remove her <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=niqab">niqab</a> [JURIST news archive], a form of veil, so he could gauge her veracity. Muhammad refused, saying she would not take off her veil in front of a male judge, and her case was dismissed. Muhammad filed a <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/muslim-woman-sues-michigan-judge-who.php">federal lawsuit</a> over the incident that was eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] in 2008. Also in 2008, a Muslim woman in Georgia was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-jails-muslim-woman-for.php">arrested and ordered to serve 10 days in jail</a> [JURIST report] for contempt of court after she refused to remove her headscarf, upon entering a security checkpoint in an Atlanta courtroom.

The Pre-Trial chamber found in each case that &quot;there is sufficient additional evidence in the case file to demonstrate that the case has progressed expeditiously&quot; and that further detention while the investigation continues is reasonable given the &quot;gravity and nature of the crimes&quot; charged.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ieng_sary_660.html">Ieng Sary</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ieng+sary">news archive</a>] was foreign minister during the Khmer Rouge regime, while his wife <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/thirith_ieng_702.html">Ieng Thirith</a> [Trial Watch profile; <a href="http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/trial-proceedings/ieng-thirith.html">case materials</a>] served as social affairs minister. <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/khieu_samphan_655.html">Khieu Samphan</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khieu+Samphan+">news archive</a>] was the head of state.

In December, the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-asks-for.php">heard final arguments</a> [JURIST report] in its first trial, that of <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=duch">news archive</a>], also known as &quot;Duch.&quot; Kaing was the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">first of eight</a> [JURIST report] ex-Khmer Rouge officials to be tried before the ECCC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/cln_136/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] ruled Thursday that the use of thumbnail preview images pulled from websites by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>] is not a violation of copyright law. The original lawsuit was brought against Google by an artist who had images of her work pulled from her website and displayed on Google&#39;s image search index without her express permission. The court <a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=pm&Datum=2010&Sort=3&nr=51777&pos=3&anz=96">stated</a> [press release, in German] that because the plaintiff had not used adequate protections on her website to block Google from pulling the data in question, she was implicitly agreeing to the use of her images by other websites. The court also indicated that in light of last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/europe-court-rules-google-not-violating.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] at the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] that, even if they had found that Google&#39;s use of the images constituted a violation of copyright law, Google would only have been liable for damages if someone posted the artist&#39;s images without her consent. Managing counsel for Google Germany, Arnd Haller, <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2010/04/german-supreme-court-rules-that-image.html">said</a> [blog post] that with the court&#39;s ruling &quot;News websites on the Internet, online providers of pictures and posters, artists, photographers, designers and many more who depend on the web for their livelihoods can go on using the service as a significant distribution platform.&quot; <br /><br />The German copyright case was one of several pending against Google. Earlier this month, several visual artist organizations in the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/visual-artists-sue-google-over-book.php">filed a class action suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging copyright infringement resulting from the company&#39;s <a href="http://books.google.com/bkshp?hl=en&tab=wp">book scanning project</a> [Google books]. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-urges-additional-revisions-to.php">urged a federal court to reject</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/settlement-resources.html">proposed class action settlements</a> [Authors Guild backgrounder] in a separate <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/">copyright suit</a> [case materials] between text authors and Google due to copyright and antitrust concerns. In February, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the proposed settlement but did not indicate when a ruling can be expected.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French Justice Ministry on Thursday denied a request from former Panamanian military leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/20/newsid_4054000/4054951.stm">Manuel Noriega</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manuel+noriega">news archive</a>] to be treated as a prisoner of war (POW). Noriega currently awaits trial in France on money laundering charges. Justice Ministry spokesperson Guillaume Didier said that Noriega will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gODl19SGLO7Ov9_Wu46K03st3jCg">not be treated as a POW</a> [AFP report] because the charges are based on breaches of common law not related to military service. Being treated as a POW would entitle Noriega to special treatment under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC backgrounder], but Guillaume says conditions of French prisons are consistent with the requirements of the Geneva Conventions regardless. Noriega was already <a href="http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/panama/noriegas-sentence.htm">sentenced <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span></a> [Reuters report] to 10 years in jail by a French court in 1999, but under French law is entitled to a new trial. <br /><br />Earlier this week, Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said that his government will seek the Noriega&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">extradition</a> [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama. Also this week, a French judge ruled that Noriega must <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-judge-orders-noriega-to-remain.php">remain in custody</a> [JURIST report] until his trial. Noriega arrived in France Tuesday morning after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges. He had <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fought extradition</a> [JURIST report] from the US since 2007. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega&#39;s petition to stop the extradition process. The US State Department had indicated that it was satisfied that <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/france-will-treat-noriega-as-pow-after.php">France will treat Noriega as a POW</a> [JURIST report] if Noriega was extradited to that country.

The two men allegedly received at least $50,000 for providing al Qaeda with &quot;computer advice and assistance, services, and currency,&quot; among other acts, between November 2007 and March 2010. The charges were filed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. The US <a href="www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has been advocating using the criminal justice system as a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/cjs">counter-terrorism tool</a> [DOJ backgrounder].

<p>In March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration to hold civilian trials for accused <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> conspirators, including <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archives].

The original lawsuit was brought against Google by an artist who had images of her work pulled from her website and displayed on Google&#39;s image search index without her express permission. The court <a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=pm&Datum=2010&Sort=3&nr=51777&pos=3&anz=96">stated</a> [press release, in German] that because the plaintiff had not used adequate protections on her website to block Google from pulling the data in question, she was implicitly agreeing to the use of her images by other websites. The court also indicated that in light of last month&#39;s <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/03/europe-court-rules-google-not-violating.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] at the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] that, even if they had found that Google&#39;s use of the images constituted a violation of copyright law, Google would only have been liable for damages if someone posted the artist&#39;s images without her consent. Managing counsel for Google Germany, Arnd Haller, <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2010/04/german-supreme-court-rules-that-image.html">said</a> [blog post] that with the court&#39;s ruling &quot;News websites on the Internet, online providers of pictures and posters, artists, photographers, designers and many more who depend on the web for their livelihoods can go on using the service as a significant distribution platform.&quot; 

<p>The German copyright case was one of several pending against Google. Earlier this month, several visual artist organizations in the US <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/04/visual-artists-sue-google-over-book.php">filed a class action suit</a> [JURIST report] alleging copyright infringement resulting from the company&#39;s <a href="http://books.google.com/bkshp?hl=en&tab=wp">book scanning project</a> [Google books]. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/doj-urges-additional-revisions-to.php">urged a federal court to reject</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/settlement-resources.html">proposed class action settlements</a> [Authors Guild backgrounder] in a separate <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/">copyright suit</a> [case materials] between text authors and Google due to copyright and antitrust concerns. In February, a federal judge <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the proposed settlement but did not indicate when a ruling can be expected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khadr did appear for hearings on Thursday afternoon after Judge Patrick Parrish indicated he would be brought by force if he did not present himself willingly.

The former president judge of the <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/pa/20100430_Ex-judge_pleads_guilty_in_Luzerne__kids-for-cash__scandal.html">pleaded guilty</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Philadelphia Inquirer</span> report] to one count of racketeering conspiracy, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years. Conahan also faces a fine of no more than $250,000 and disbarment. He will be sentenced by Judge Edwin Kosik of the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], who previously <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/25judge.html?_r=2">rejected</a> [NYT report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and former judge Mark Ciavarella Jr., finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. An attorney for Ciavarella said that he plans to go to trial.

<p>As part of an ongoing public corruption investigation, US Attorney Dennis Pfannenschmidt announced earlier this month that a twenty-eighth person has been <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/pam/press_releases/Reilly_04_16_10.htm">charged</a> [press release] with soliciting and receiving bribes and gratuities in connection with the scandal. <a href="http://www.luzernecounty.org/county/row_offices/district_attorney">Luzerne County District Attorney Jacqueline Musto Carroll</a> [official website] agreed in January to <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2010/01/pennsylvania-prosecutor-will-not-retry.php">drop efforts to retry</a> 46 juveniles whose original convictions were <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">overturned</a> [JURIST reports] because they had been issued by a judge indicted on federal corruption charges for an alleged kickback scheme. This decision ended all efforts at retrying any of the convicted juveniles, who will now have their juvenile records cleared. The Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.jlc.org/news/31/no_retrials/">statement</a> [press release] applauding the decision, indicating that &quot;justice has finally been attained&quot; for the juveniles. In October, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/default.htm">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] overturned about 6,500 convictions handed down by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008, but gave prosecutors permission to seek retrial of more than 100 youths who were still under court supervision. Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September, following a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">guilty pleas</a> [JURIST reports] they entered in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Thursday, Khadr refused to attend the proceedings, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001120.html?hpid=moreheadlines&sub=AR">stating</a> [WP report] that the blackout goggles required by military protocol were aggravating an eye conditions which needed medical attention. Khadr did appear for hearings on Thursday afternoon after Judge Patrick Parrish indicated he would be brought by force if he did not present himself willingly. Khadr did not attend Friday&#39;s hearings after refusing to submit to a search prior to being transported. He contends that the search was meant to intimidate and humiliate him. Parrish indicated that he would not question security protocols and ruled that Friday&#39;s proceedings would continue without Khadr because he had voluntarily chosen not to attend. This week&#39;s hearings are being held in order to determine if statements made by Khadr during his interrogation should be <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/khadr-seeking-suppression-of.php">suppressed</a> [JURIST report]. They are to be the last preliminary hearings before his US <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commission</a> [JURIST news archive] trial in July. <br /><br />Khadr&#39;s lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/khadr-lawyers-file-emergency-motion.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] in February in the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] challenging the decision of the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">not to seek his repatriation from the United States</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the government was not obligated to seek Khadr&#39;s return to Canada despite having violated his rights under section 7 of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html?noCookie">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. Khadr has allegedly admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/khadr-admitted-throwing-grenade-that.php">throwing a hand grenade</a> [JURIST report] that killed a US soldier in Afghanistan.
