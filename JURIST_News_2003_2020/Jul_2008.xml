		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French court Monday ordered Internet auction house <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aboutebay.html?_trksid=m40">eBay</a> [corporate website] to pay $63 million in damages to <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Mo&euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [corporate website], finding that the website failed to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods that infringed on registered designs.   LVMH praised the holding as a victory for designers seeking to control the distribution of their merchandise or prevent the sale of &quot;copycat&quot; products.  In June, another French court ruled against eBay in a similar lawsuit for failing to prevent the sale of fake <a href="http://www.hermes-international.com/fr/2008/doc_info_annuel.php">Herm&egrave;s International SCA</a> [corporate website] products.  EBay said that it <a href="http://news.ebay.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=319007">would appeal Monday&#39;s decision</a> [press release].  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/technology/01ebay.html?ex=1372564800&en=432ba2e242ede14a&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">more</a>.    Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=akj0GpDRGf.Y&refer=europe">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The ruling comes as part of a growing trend, as European nations tighten restrictions on imitation luxury goods. A <a href="http://www.justiz.bayern.de/">German court</a> [Bavarian justice system website, in German] last week <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/germany-court-rules-china-counterfeit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a sports utility vehicle manufactured in China bore an unacceptable resemblance to a model manufactured by German automaker <a href="http://www.bmw.com/">BMW</a> [corporate website], ordering the SUV&#39;s importers to stop sales of the infringing SUV, destroy all remaining cars, and pay compensatory damages to BMW.  Last year, DaimlerChrysler <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/29/daimler-bmw-update-markets-equity-cx_po_0829markets20.html">threatened to sue Shuanghuan Automobile</a> [<em>Forbes</em> report] over a car it alleged infringed on its designs. The US and the European Commission (EC) <a href="http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2007/October/Ambassador_Schwab_Announces_US_Will_Seek_New_Trade_Agreement_to_Fight_Fakes.html">announced</a> [US Trade Representative press release; EC <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/1573&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">press release</a>] plans in 2007 to negotiate an <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-european-commission-announce.php">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA) [JURIST report] to promote international enforcement of <a href="/courses/intellectualpropertylaw.php">copyright law</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Agreement is on the agenda for the G-8 summit taking place this month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The Shanghai People&#39;s Higher Court will broadcast its hearings online, a Shanghai judge announced Tuesday.  China <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/130668.stm">began televising live court cases</a> [BBC report] in 1998, and the internet broadcasts are the newest element of its effort to increase judicial transparency.  Speaking at a conference last week, Supreme People&#39;s Court (SPC) Chief Justice Wang Shengjun <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-06/24/content_6788001.htm">recommended</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report]: <blockquote>We should make full use of the Internet, letters from and visits by the masses and appeals, among others, to ensure that the public can express their opinions.</blockquote>  The SPC has also promised that judges whose decisions are frequently overturned will be punished. <em>Shanghai Daily</em> has <a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2008/200807/20080701/article_365191.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />China&#39;s judicial system was devastated by the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/china_50/cult.htm">Cultural Revolution</a> [BBC backgrounder], and the nation has been trying to implement the rule of law <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947033,00.html">for decades</a> [1979 <em>Time</em> report], but many judges remain completely untrained. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/china0408/">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/china-lawyers-subject-to-official.php">report</a>] accusing the Chinese government of subjecting lawyers  to increasing persecution and intimidation.  HRW acknowledged that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is establishing a modern court system that purports to &quot;recognize the validity of human rights norms,&quot; but stressed that much improvement is needed.  HRW urged the Chinese government to ensure greater freedom for lawyers, particularly imprisoned human rights advocates <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/china-court-sentences-dissident-lawyer.php">Yang Maodong</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/chinese-lawyer-detained-for-sending.php">Gao Zhiseng</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_08-52_Jun08.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/">Office of Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] has found that while US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] is not responsible for the 2006 deaths of two detainees, ICE officials do not always adhere to proper medical protocols. The medical standards chapter of the ICE <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/partners/dro/opsmanual/medical.pdf">Detention Operations Manual</a> [text, PDF] requires ICE officials to medically evaluate and care for detainees. However, in the two cases investigated by OIG, detainees with prior medical conditions were found to have been improperly treated. In those two cases, one detainee died of a parasitic brain infection, while the other died of malignant pancreatic cancer, but according to the OIG report, ICE officials&#39; failure to follow detainee treatment protocol did not contribute to the deaths. OIG investigators wrote: <blockquote>The two detainees died as a result of serious pre-existing medical conditions. Although there have been problems with adherence to medical standards at the two facilities in question, ICE&#8217;s overall standards are equivalent to other detention organizations. ICE has been taking steps to enhance its ability to effectively monitor immigration detention facilities.</blockquote> The report recommended stricter standards and reporting requirements, as well as increased oversight and internal reviews. ICE has maintained that it <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/detention_health_care.htm">provides sufficient medical care</a> [ICE statement] for its detainees. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5haVi3MmR8ZkNZiAqzGMUmKi8PUqAD91LC1T00">more</a>.<br /><br />US immigration detention practices have been criticized in the past for providing inadequate levels of medical care. In June 2007, the <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</A> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/woods_v_myers_complaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</A> [petition, PDF; <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/detention/30102prs20070613.html">press release</A>] against federal immigration officials, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of immigration detainees, alleging that <A src="/paperchase/2007/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-for-immigration.php">inadequate medical and mental health care</A> [JURIST report] at detention facilities has caused &quot;unnecessary suffering [and] avoidable death.&quot; Later that year, <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) said DHS policies for detainees with AIDS <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2007/us1207/">do not meet international and domestic standards of care</a> [report text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/dhs-immigration-detention-care-for-hiv.php">report</a>], and that the DHS consistently fails to enforce its own minimum standards.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Millions of Swedish citizens have filed <a href="http://blogg.expressen.se/thomasmattsson/entry.jsp?messid=390294">electronic petitions</a> [sample petitions, in Swedish] against the country&#39;s newly approved <a href="http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/8670/a/78367">electronic wiretapping law</a> [draft text, in Swedish], according to news reports Wednesday. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sweden-approves-wiretapping-bill.php">narrowly approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month and gives  the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.fra.se/english.shtml">National Defence Radio Establishment</a> [official website] broad authority to monitor international telephone and electronic communications passing through the country. Upon passage, opponents warned that the bill could also be used to <a href="http://mp.se/templates/Mct_78.aspx?avdnr=12575&number=152238">intercept domestic communications</a> [press release, in Swedish], and more recently one business leader said that it may <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/12744/20080630/">drive high-tech companies out of the country</a> [<em>Local</em> report]. The new law is scheduled to take effect in January 2009. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hp_i3fXl5TKV39naTF8uW6bXspGwD91L7ULG6">more</a>. <font style="font-style: italic;">Expressen</font> has <a href="http://www.expressen.se/1.1214535">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Warrantless wiretaps have been an increasingly controversial topic as officials struggle to balance civil liberties with security concerns. In February, a Canadian judge <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/Jdb-txt/SC/08/02/2008BCSC0212.htm">ruled</a> [excerpts] that <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI-gb:s_184//en?noCookie">Section 184.4</a> of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showtdm/cs/C-46?noCookie">Canadian Criminal Code</a> [text], which allows law enforcement officers to electronically intercept private communications in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; without court authorization, is unconstitutional because it violates &quot;the fundamental freedom to be free from unreasonable search and seizure&quot; protected by the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. In March, the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a controversial bill to amend the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fisa">Foreign Intelligence Security Act</a> [JURIST news archive] that would extend government power to eavesdrop on individuals within the US under judicial oversight but not grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that had previously allowed the government to eavesdrop on their lines as part of its <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">warrantless wiretapping program</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US&nbsp;<a href="http://feingold.senate.gov/">Sen. Russ Feingold</a> (D-WI) [official website] has criticized the <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection&#39;s</a> (CBP) [official website] warrantless searches and seizures of travelers&#39; laptops and other digital devices at the US border, calling the searches an <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearing.cfm?id=3420">unacceptable invasion of privacy</a> [hearing materials]. The Supreme Court has held that reasonable suspicion is not necessary to conduct routine searches at the border, but searches of laptops and other digital devices are analogous to more invasive practices such as strip searches, said&nbsp;Feingold, who chairs the&nbsp;<a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/subcommittees/110/constitution110.cfm">Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution</a>&nbsp;[official website].&nbsp;In his opening statement at a congressional hearing on this issue last week, Feingold <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=3420&wit_id=4083">said</a> [speech text]:<blockquote>Ideally, Fourth Amendment jurisprudence would evolve to protect Americans&#8217; privacy in this once unfathomable situation. But if the courts can&#8217;t offer that protection, then that responsibility falls to Congress. Customs agents must have the ability to conduct even highly intrusive searches when there is reason to suspect criminal or terrorist activity, but suspicionless searches of Americans&#8217; laptops and similar devices go too far. Congress should not allow this gross violation of privacy.</blockquote>Feingold said that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dhs.gov%2F&ei=n89qSPWLK4LMevP83fIL&usg=AFQjCNG7Axpltrd6MYjGhtNUSsUz9cX-RA&sig2=YzIomEcuMwzQh-MMOQQBYA">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] will not explain why and when it conducts such digital searches.&nbsp;AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20080625/tc_pcworld/147546">more</a>.<br /><br />Feingold has&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/05/doj-to-share-interrogation-opinions.php">often criticized</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] the Bush administration&#39;s failure to share information with Congress, and in February, privacy advocate&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>&nbsp;[advocacy website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/alc/alc-complaint.pdf">filed suit</a>&nbsp;[complaint, PDF] against DHS to discover more information on the government&#39;s policies.&nbsp;In April, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ca9.uscourts.gov%2F&ei=gs9qSOqwEKTYePXruOwL&usg=AFQjCNEqeLDtPl1dSzUYE9RWlqXhTaoeEQ&sig2=LbhG0Z4ZpH8-cwds7krRSA">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/6D5D931898D8168188257432005AC9B8/$file/0650581.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that reasonable suspicion is not necessary for a warrantless search of a laptop or other digital device at the border due to inherent national security interests.  The court rejected the argument that a laptop is like a human mind because of its ability to record ideas and emails, and held instead that a laptop is the same as closed containers such as purses and wallets. Civil liberties groups have <a href="http://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/06/12">petitioned</a> [EFF press release] the Ninth Circuit to rehear the case <span style="font-style:italic;">en banc</span>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chilean judge Monday sentenced <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/juan-manuel-guillermo_contreras-sepulveda_257.html">General Manuel Contreras</a> [TrialWatch profile] to two consecutive life terms in prison for a 1974 car bombing that killed another general and his wife. At the time of the bombing, Contreras was the head of the country&#39;s infamous secret police, the <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/chile/dina.htm">National Intelligence Directive</a> (DINA), under former dictator <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archive].  The sentence is the longest that has yet been given to a member of Pinochet&#39;s regime and will only symbolically increase the more than 60 years in prison that Contreras has already been sentenced to for other crimes. McClatchy has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/story/589176.html">more</a>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Patagonia Times</span> has <a href="http://www.patagoniatimes.cl/content/view/572/1/">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In April, Contreras was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/chile-court-sentences-former-general.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 15 years in prison for his role in the 1974 disappearance of a political dissident. In January, a Chilean appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/chile-court-sentences-pinochet-police.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Contreras to 10 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping of seven neighborhood leaders from La Legua in December 1973. In November 2007, Chile&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chile-high-court-upholds-convictions-of.php">affirmed seven convictions and overturned one</a> [JURIST report] in cases involving murders committed by state agents during Pinochet&#39;s 1973-90 regime. The court based that decision on the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials], finding that Chile was in a state of internal armed conflict when the murders occurred.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Italian Court of Cassation</a> [official website] Monday overturned the convictions of six Italians, including Verona Mayor Flavio Tosi, for distributing anti-Roma literature in 2001.  The court found that the men were motivated by a belief that all Roma are thieves, but held that this motivation did not amount to &quot;racial hatred&quot; under existing Italian anti-discrimination laws.  The decision is expected to draw anger from human rights groups and <a href="http://www.errc.org/">Roma advocates</a> [European Roma Rights Centre website].  It was speculated that the release of the ruling, which was handed down in March, was timed to bolster recent government <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-plan-to-fingerprint-roma.php">plans to fingerprint</a> [JURIST report] the nation&#39;s entire Roma population.  <a href="http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,3438,en_21571361_34360727_34508996_1_1_1_1,00.html">Interior Minister Roberto Maroni</a> [OECD profile] said that the fingerprinting would help to reduce street begging and keep children in school, but opponents immediately criticized it as a method of &quot;ethnic screening.&quot;  The <em>Guardian</em> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/01/italy">more</a>.<br /><br />In November 2005, the <a href="http://www.eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php">European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia</a> (EUMC) [advocacy website] reported that Roma minorities are the ethnic group <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/roma-facing-most-prejudice-in-european.php">most susceptible to racism in the European Union </a>[JURIST report].  Two years later, in November 2007, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/echr-rules-against-separate-schooling.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the educational separation of Roma children in the Czech Republic, holding that the practice amounted to racial discrimination and violated principles of human rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit Monday released <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200806/06-1397-1124487.pdf">declassified portions of last month&#39;s decision</a> [PDF text] that a US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Combatant_Tribunals.html">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> [DOD materials] had improperly designated a <a href="/currentawareness/uighurs.php">Chinese Uighur Muslim</a> [JURIST news archive] detained at Guantanamo Bay as an enemy combatant. In the opinion, Circuit Judge Merrick Garland dismissed government arguments that classified documents established Huzaifa Parhat&#39;s terror connections:<blockquote>First, the government suggests that several of the assertions in the intelligence documents are reliable because they are made in at least three different documents. We are not persuaded. ... In fact, we have no basis for concluding that there are independent sources for the documents&#39; thrice-made assertions. To the contrary, as noted in Part III, many of those assertions are made in identical language, suggesting that later documents may merely be citing earlier ones, and hence that all may ultimately derive from a single source. And as we have also noted, Parhat has made a credible argument that - at least for some of the assertions - the common source is the Chinese government, which may be less than objective with respect to the Uighurs. Other assertions in the documents may ultimately rely on interview reports (not provided to the Tribunal) of Uighur detainees, who may have had no first-hand knowledge and whose speculations may have been transformed into certainties in the course of being repeated by report writers.</blockquote>Last month, the court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/parhat-order-6-20-08.pdf">ordered</a> [PDF text] the US government to release or transfer Parhat.  Barring release or transfer, the order directed the US to &quot;expeditiously hold a new Tribunal consistent with the court&#39;s opinion.&quot;  Parhat can challenge his detention in federal court and seek immediate release through a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> pursuant to the US Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in  <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>].     The <I>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.twincities.com/national/ci_9748349?source=rss">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, US Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers defended Parhat&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-defends-detention-of-uighur-at.php">detention</a> [JURIST report] in oral arguments before the court, claiming he is an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; due to his ties with the <a href="http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=4347">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [MIPT backgrounder], a militant group that calls for separation from China and was designated as a terrorist group by the US government in 2002. The DOJ acknowledged that Parhat did not fight against the US and that there is no evidence that he intended to do so, but said he can still be held under the <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/sjres23.enr.html">Authorization for Use of Military Force Act of 2001</a> [SJ Res 23 materials] because ETIM is affiliated with al Qaeda. In 2006, five Chinese Uighur detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">released to Albania</a> [JURIST report], where officials reviewed applications for asylum. The transfer, which was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/china-wants-gitmo-uighurs-back-says.php">criticized by China</a>, ended a court challenge against the detainees&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/federal-judge-rules-chinese-gitmo.php">indefinite detention</a> [JURIST reports]. In December 2006, lawyers for seven Uighur detainees <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/chinese-guantanamo-detainees-file.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the process by which they were determined to be enemy combatants was flawed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/">Constitutional Court of Hungary</a> [official website] Monday ruled that two proposals passed by the country&#39;s parliament to criminalize hate speech were unconstitutional infringements on the freedom of expression.  The court held that the extremist speech that the amendments sought to prevent was not a danger to society because it was already marginalized. The first bill, passed last year, would have allowed recovery in cases where a person&#39;s ethnic group - rather than the individual person - was insulted.  The second bill, <a href="http://www.politics.hu/20080219/hate-speech-proposal-passed-by-hungarian-parliament">passed in February</a> [Politics.hu report], would have designated national, ethnic, racial, or religious insults as misdemeanors punishable by up to two years in prison. In March, <a href="http://www.keh.hu/keh_en">Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom</a> [official website] requested that the Constitutional Court rule on the constitutionality of the two amendments before they took effect.  AFP has <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080630/twl-hungary-constitution-hate-speech-4bdc673.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Balancing free speech interests with anti-hate efforts has also been a difficult task for other European governments in recent years. In 2006, British politicians, writers and comedians urged members of the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm">House of Commons</a> [official website] to accept freedom of speech revisions in the controversial <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldbills/015/06015.i-iii.html">Racial and Religious Hatred Bill</a> [text; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3873323.stm">BBC Q/A</a>]. The bill was <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldbills/015/amend/ml015-ir.htm">amended</a> [official amendments; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/uk-house-of-lords-amends-proposed.php">report</a>] in the British <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about_lords/about_lords.cfm">House of Lords</a> [official website] in 2005 when peers voted to restrict punishable actions to &quot;threatening words or behavior&quot; rather than including words which may be insulting or abusive, which critics said would <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/english-comic-slams-uk-religious.php">unfairly infringe upon comedians</a> [JURIST report] and writers who satirize religion.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=437">Polish President Lech Kaczynski</a> [official website] Tuesday refused to sign the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], properly known as the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">website</a>], saying that to do so would be &quot;pointless&quot; after Irish voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the treaty in a June referendum.  The treaty&#39;s future has been uncertain since the Irish vote, as the instrument requires that all 27 European Union member nations ratify it before it can go into effect.  In April, the lower house of the <a href="http://www.sejm.gov.pl/">Polish parliament</a> [official website, in Polish] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/poland-lower-house-approves-eu-reform.php">voted 384-56</a> [JURIST  report] to approve the EU Reform Treaty.  The Upper House approved it the following day.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7482660.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Poland had <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/poland-pm-calls-for-new-discussions-on.php">raised numerous objections to the pact during negotiations</a>, many having to do with the proposed Council of Europe voting system, but <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/eu-leaders-sign-reform-treaty.php">signed the reform treaty</a> [JURIST reports] along with other EU nations in December. Fourteen countries have <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lisbon+treaty">ratified the document</a> [JURIST news archive].  In 2005, an earlier draft for a <a href="/currentawareness/euconstitution.php">European constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] failed when voters in <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-exit-polls-say-france.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST reports] rejected the proposal in national referenda.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTQyMTYtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-4216-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl3f1/2/hilite">dismissed</a> [decision, PDF] a lawsuit brought by Canadian citizen <a href="http://www.maherarar.ca/">Maher Arar</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=arar">news archive</a>], who sought a declaratory judgment against US government officials for deporting him to Syria. The court ruled that Arar had failed to state a claim for which it had jurisdiction to grant relief: <blockquote>We do not doubt that if Congress were so inclined, it could exercise its powers under the Constitution to authorize a cause of action for money damages to redress the type of claims asserted by Arar in this action.  The fact remains, however, that Congress has not done so.  Instead, it has chosen to establish a remedial process that does not include a cause of action for damages against US officials for injuries arising from the exercise of their discretionary authority to remove inadmissible aliens.  We are not free to be indifferent to the determinations of Congress, or to ignore the Supreme Court&#39;s instructions to exercise great caution when considering whether to devise new and heretofore unknown, causes of action.</blockquote> The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), which represented Arar, <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/no-justice-canadian-rendition-victim-maher-arar">expressed disappointment</a> [press release] at the ruling, pointing to the court&#39;s dissenting opinion that the ruling would allow the government to &quot;violate constitutional rights with virtual impunity.&quot; Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN3041828520080630">more</a>. Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ihSd23YLVLMLx8tEc6GQXpZ12j7A">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Arar was detained by the US in 2002 after flying to New York from Tunisia on his way home to Canada.  He was later tansferred to Syria, where he alleges he was tortured. Arar had <a href="http://www.ccr-ny.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-argues-appeal-rendition-victim-maher-arar%3A-u.s.-officials-must-be-held-a">argued</a> [CCR press release] that he should be able to challenge the US government&#39;s policy of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victim Protection Act</a> [text] and the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution.  In October 2007, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-lawmakers-apologize-to-rendition.php">apologized</a> [JURIST report] to Arar during a joint hearing of the <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">House Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [official website]. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice <a href="http://international.edgeboss.net/real/international/fc_10-24-07.smi">testified</a> [recorded video] in front of the same committee that Arar&#39;s rendition was not &quot;handled as it should have been,&quot; but stopped short of apologizing. Rice added that the US government has told the Canadian government that it will &quot;try to do better in the future.&quot; In January 2007, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/canada-pm-announces-settlement-with.php">apologized to Arar</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the Canadian government and announced a settlement of $10.5 million (CAD) compensation for pain and suffering.

Sun Lin, who writes under the pen name Jie Mu, has reported on sensitive topics including crime, police brutality, and corruption in China, and Boxun said Sun was being punished for his work. His wife, He Fang, a Boxun contributor, received a suspended sentence for similar charges.  The two have been in Chinese custody since their <a href="http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=71556">arrest</a> [<em>Asia Media</em> report] in May 2007. <a href="http://www.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] condemned Sun&#39;s sentence, <a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=27689">calling it</a> [RSF press release] &quot;yet another tragic example of the government&#39;s inability to tolerate journalists who dare to report news freely, without constraint or censorship.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jYFSY7vQGjgTs4Whr1olMwQXcMnQD91KV8V04">more</a>.<br /><br />China has continued to stifle dissent, including arresting and imprisoning journalists and writers, in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games, being held this summer in Beijing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/June/08-tax-579.html">filed papers</a> [press release] in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida Monday asking the court to force a Swiss bank to hand over the names of American clients suspected of hiding funds from tax collectors.  The DOJ is requesting permission for the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] to issue &quot;John Doe&quot; summons against <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] to obtain information about unidentified American bank patrons accused of tax fraud.  A former UBS banker <a href="http://www.examiner.com/Subject-Bradley_Birkenfeld.html">pleaded guilty</a> [<em>San Francisco Examiner</em> news archive] to conspiracy to defraud the IRS last month, after he admitted that UBS employees assisted US citizens in hiding approximately $20 billion in taxable assets. IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman <a href="http://op.bna.com/dt.nsf/id/emcy-7g4uah">said</a> [statement]:<blockquote>Today&#39;s action sends a strong, unequivocal signal to anyone thinking of short-changing the nation and their fellow citizens by evading the tax laws.<br /><br />Offshore accounts harbor billions of dollars, and people should take notice that the secrecy surrounding these deals is rapidly fading. The information we would gather from this action would help us detect wealthy individuals who don&#39;t pay their taxes as well as provide details about how advisors facilitate this abuse.</blockquote>The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/business/worldbusiness/01ubs.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1214922789-aNJxIwVPoeoATU5P8U6twQ">more</a>.    The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121486342353917387.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Owners of Swiss bank accounts have traditionally enjoyed great privacy, but Swiss banks have recently released information on certain clients. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.ofj.admin.ch/bj/en/home.html">Swiss Justice Ministry</a> [official website] granted US investigators <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/switzerland-to-give-us-prosecutors.php">access to information</a> [JURIST report] about bank accounts of terrorism suspects.  Prosecutors in the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/vae/">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] requested the information in a four-year old investigation into money laundering to support terrorist activities.  The same year, the Swiss Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/swiss-court-denies-russian-request-for.php">denied a Russian request</a> [JURIST report] for the transfer of bank documents to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a> [JURIST news archive] which were relevant to an ongoing investigation into Russian oil giant <a href="http://www.yukos.com/">Yukos</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nearly $100 million in annual funding is needed to fix California&#39;s &quot;dysfunctional&quot; prison system, according to a state commission&#39;s <a href="http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/reports/dp/official/FINAL%20REPORT%20DEATH%20PENALTY.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/press/Press28.pdf">press release</a>] released Monday. The <a href="http://www.ccfaj.org/">California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice</a> (CCFAJ) [official website] was asked to evaluate instances of wrongful convictions and to make informed recommendations for future changes.  The CCFAJ report found: <blockquote>The system is plagued with excessive delay in the appointments of counsel for direct appeals and <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions, and a severe backlog in the review of appeals and <em>habeas</em> petitions before the California Supreme Court. Ineffective assistance of counsel and other claims of constitutional violations are succeeding in federal courts at a very high rate.</blockquote> Because it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than to keep an inmate sentenced to life without parole, the CCFAJ also suggested that the state could alleviate some stresses on the system by allowing for more judicial discretion in sentencing or narrowing the list of crimes punishable by death. The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-death1-2008jul01,0,722194.story">more</a>.<br /><br />The California justice system has previously tried to reduce the death row population by increasing the judicial discretion allowed, but <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/california-high-court-urges.php">recent proposals</a> were <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/california-supreme-court-withdraws.php">withdrawn</a> [JURIST reports] out of fear of overburdening appellate courts. The CCFAJ found that California has the largest death row among all 50 states, with 670 prisoners, but that the California appeals process takes an average of eight to 13 years longer than those in the other states. Under California law, a death sentence is <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=922266169+3+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">automatically appealed</a> [California Penal Code s. 1239(b) text] to the state Supreme Court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US does not appropriately protect its citizens and foreign nationals from executions that are out of line with international law, <a href="http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/about/people.html#alston">UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Philip Alston</a> [advocacy profile] <a href="http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/news/united_states/Press_Statement.pdf">said</a> [statement, PDF; <a href="http://webcast.un.org/ramgen/ondemand/pressconference/2008/pc080630am1.rm">video</a>, RM] Monday.  Alston said state death penalty systems need stronger safeguards against&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aba-recommends-georgia-death-penalty.php">racial bias</a> [JURIST report] and wrongful convictions.  He added that investigations into the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/us-marine-charged-with-murder-in.php">deaths of foreign detainees held in US custody</a> [JURIST report] are often insufficient, due process protections are inadequate for those facing the death penalty under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions+act">news archive</a>], and US military contractors <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-should-prosecute-contractors-who.php">are not held accountable </a> [JURIST report] for killings committed abroad. Summarizing his findings, Alston said:<blockquote>If there is a single theme that emerges from my visit it is the need for greater transparency in relation to a number of issues of major importance... I was frequently told by Government officials that although they were unable to answer my specific questions, I should rest assured that there was accountability.  Whether or not it does in fact exist, this &#8220;private&#8221; or &#8220;internal&#8221; accountability cannot take the place of genuine, public accountability.  A Government open and accountable to its people is a foundational premise of a democratic state.</blockquote> Alston, who is also a law professor at NYU, <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2008/080630_Alston.doc.htm">presented the report</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.blogger.com/a%20href=" edu="" paperchase="" 2007="" 10="">after an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into both the formal death penalty system and extrajudicial killings. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hfeTXJcArPUC_qgbHITFRypXfs4w">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hfeTXJcArPUC_qgbHITFRypXfs4w">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The US had been under a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">de-facto moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty from September 2007 until April of this year, as the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] considered <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/bazvree">Baze v. Rees</a> [Duke law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">report</a>], a case which challenged the legality of Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection protocol.  The Court upheld the procedure, ruling that it did not violate the Constitution&#39;s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.  In another landmark decision <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/kenvlou">Kennedy v. Louisiana</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">report</a>], the Court held that a death sentence does constitute cruel and unusual punishment when imposed for a crime in which the victim was not killed.

Jaruzelski was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/poland-prosecutors-charge-communist.php">charged in March 2006</a> [JURIST report] with &quot;organizing crimes of a military nature&quot; and carrying out crimes that consisted of the deprivation of freedom through internment&quot; in connection with his imposition of <a href="http://www.poland.gov.pl/?document=366">martial law</a> [Polish government backgrounder] in Poland on December 13, 1981. The trial is expected to begin in September or October. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gz5MbrNiCRGntARe9Q-yoAREV6OwD91KGVSG0">more</a>. From Poland, <em>The News</em> has <a href="http://www.polskieradio.pl/thenews/news/?id=85927">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last week, a Polish court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/poland-court-rules-on-riot-police.php">overturned the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of a riot police officer found guilty for the 1981 shooting deaths of nine coal miners who were protesting Jaruzelski&#39;s imposition of martial law. Jaruzelski was previously tried in 2001 for ordering troops to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1331686.stm">fire on striking ship workers</a> [BBC report] in the 1970s, but the trial ended without a verdict. About 100 people are said to have died as a result of the declaration of martial law and subsequent arrests of <a href="http://www.solidarity.gov.pl/">Solidarity movement</a> [official website] leaders, including former Polish president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/963417.stm">Lech Walesa</a> [BBC profile].  An estimated 10,000 people were held in internment camps during martial law. Jaruzelski has argued that his decision to impose martial law was necessary to maintain order and prevent foreign intervention in Poland.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four former <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-files-four-new-abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuits-targeting-military-contractor">filed lawsuits</a> [CCR materials] Monday against two private US military contractors and three of their employees, alleging torture, war crimes and civil conspiracy. The former detainees said that employees of <a href="http://www.caci.com/">CACI International</a> and <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/">L-3 Communications</a> [corporate websites], which performed interrogation and interpretation work for the US military, violated the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Geneva Convention</a>, the <a href="http://www.army.mil/fm1/">Army Field Manual</a> [texts] and US law by torturing and conspiring to torture the detainees.  They further alleged that CACI and L-3 negligently failed to prevent the torture. In a <a href="http://www.caci.com/iraq/ccr_state_5-7-08.shtml">statement</a> [text], CACI responded: <blockquote>After numerous and thorough government investigations, no CACI employee or former employee has been charged with any misconduct in connection with CACI&#39;s interrogation work in Iraq. CACI has unequivocally renounced the abuse that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison and has cooperated fully in all government inquiries of this matter. CACI does not condone or tolerate illegal or inappropriate behavior by any employee when engaged in CACI business.</blockquote> The men are seeking a jury trial and all remedies available to them, including compensatory damages, punitive damages and court costs. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gROPg2e2CXQULZxrFLEK1Gz7DstQ">more</a>.<br /><br />In May, another former Abu Ghraib detainee <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/abu-ghraib-ex-detainee-files-torture.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against CACI and L-3 alleging torture and conspiracy. Last year, US District Judge James Robertson <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv1165-137">refused to dismiss</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-judge-rules-abu-ghraib-abuse-lawsuit.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/saleh-v.-titan">class action lawsuit</a> [CCR materials] against CACI alleging torture. Robertson dismissed a similar lawsuit against L-3 subsidiary Titan, saying that Titan&#39;s translators worked under the military&#39;s exclusive supervision and control. Robertson concluded, though, that &quot;a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that CACI retained significant authority to manage its employees.&quot; An <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/Saleh_FourthAmendedComplaint_12_07.pdf">amended complaint</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-lawsuit-claims-us-contractor.php">report</a>] alleged that CACI was responsible for the torture of more than 250 former detainees held in Iraqi prisons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.ri.us/Supreme/defaultnew-supreme.htm">Supreme Court of Rhode Island</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.courts.ri.gov/supreme/pdf-files/04-63_7-2-08.pdf">overturned</a> [decision, PDF] a 2006 jury verdict <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/rhode-island-jury-finds-lead-paint.php">holding paint manufacturers liable</a> [JURIST report] for contamination caused by lead-based paint. The court rejected state arguments that the paint companies had created a public nuisance,  finding that they had no control over how the paint was used:<blockquote>But however grave the problem of lead poisoning is in Rhode Island, public nuisance law simply does not provide a remedy for this harm.  The state has not and cannot allege facts that would fall within the parameters of what would constitute public nuisance under Rhode Island law.  As set forth more thoroughly herein, defendants were not in control of any lead pigment at the time the lead caused harm to children in Rhode Island, making defendants unable to abate the alleged nuisance, the standard remedy in a public nuisance action.</blockquote>The court also ruled that protection against the dangers of lead paint was already available under laws requiring property owners to mitigate the risks of lead contamination.  Rhode Island <a href="http://www.riag.state.ri.us/">Attorney General Patrick Lynch</a> [official website] issued a statement <a href="http://thephoenix.com/blogs/notfornothing/archive/2008/07/01/lynch-statement-on-lead-paint-ruling.aspx">criticizing the ruling</a> [Phoenix report]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gowfIfp9t-BVbEol52gXgHi4gWqwD91LBFS80">more</a>. <em>Providence Journal</em> has <a href="http://www.projo.com/news/environment/content/Paint_suit_07-02-08_SEANHTM_v41.403bac8.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The sale of lead paint was banned in 1978 after studies concluded that lead content caused serious health problems to children, and various states have addressed the issue of paint manufacturer liability. In June 2007 the Missouri Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/missouri-high-court-rejects-st-louis.php">rejected efforts</a> [JURIST report] by the city of St. Louis to recoup $15 million in lead paint removal costs from paint and pigment manufacturers because the city was unable to connect any specific manufacturer to the paint particular cleanup sites.  July 2005, the Wisconsin Supreme Court extended the &quot;risk contribution theory&quot; to lead paint manufacturers and <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/states-brief-wi-supreme-court-extends.php">allowed a suit filed against them to proceed</a> [JURIST report] even though plaintiffs could not link their injuries to the products of a specific company.

HRW rejected government claims that the detentions are meant for the refugees&#39; own protection and called on the government to give aid agencies access to detainees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://beckermanlegal.com/Documents/viacom_youtube_080702DecisionDiscoveryRulings.pdf">ordered</a> [PDF text] <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google</a> to turn over databases containing logs of every time any IP address has accessed any <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/about">YouTube</a> [corporate websites] video. <a href="http://www.viacom.com/">Viacom</a> [corporate website] had requested access to the databases in a <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/new-york/nysdce/1:2007cv02103/302164/">lawsuit</a> [case materials] brought for copyright infringement, arguing that Google and YouTube knowingly made copyrighted material available on their websites without permission. District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Google&#39;s claim that turning over user information would invade users&#39; privacy in violation of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002710----000-.html">Video Privacy Protection Act</a> [text], finding that an IP address or YouTube username alone was not enough to identify users. The court did, however, reject Viacom&#39;s bid to compel Google to turn over larger databases which include user-provided text summaries of hosted videos. Technology and privacy advocates <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/07/court-ruling-will-expose-viewing-habits-youtube-us">sharply criticized</a> [EFF blog post] the order, saying that it would set a dangerous precedent for internet privacy. Computerworld has <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&taxonomyName=government&articleId=9106518&taxonomyId=13&intsrc=kc_top">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Strict French anti-terrorism laws violate European and international human rights standards, according to a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/france0708/france0708web.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/02/france19186.htm">press release</a>] released by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Wednesday. In particular, the report criticized a <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=1E97FE2A9723687EB3B7073D0870C5D2.tpdjo04v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000367689&dateTexte=">French law</a> [text, in French] criminalizing &quot;association in relation to a terrorist undertaking,&quot; which HRW says allows prosecutors and law enforcement officials to detain terrorism suspects without cause and undermine suspects&#39; right to a fair trial:<blockquote>Central to this preemptive approach is the broadly defined offense of &quot;criminal association in relation to a terrorist undertaking&quot; (association de malfaiteurs en relation avec une entreprise terroriste, hereafter &quot;association de malfaiteurs&quot;). Established as a separate offense in 1996, it allows the authorities to intervene with the aim of preventing terrorism well before the commission of a crime. No specific terrorist act need be planned, much less executed, to give rise to the offense. Intended to criminalize all preparatory acts short of direct complicity in a terrorist plot, an association de malfaiteurs charge may be leveled for providing any kind of logistical or financial support to, or associating in a sustained fashion with, groups allegedly formed with the ultimate goal of engaging in terrorist activity....<br /><br />In practice, French counterterrorism laws and procedures undermine the right of those facing charges of terrorism to a fair trial. The broad definition and expansive interpretation of association de malfaiteurs translate into a low standard of proof for decisions to arrest suspects or to place them under investigation by a judge. Indeed, casting a wide net to ensnare large numbers of people who might have some connection with an alleged terrorist network has been one of the characteristics of investigations into association de malfaiteurs.</blockquote> The report also faulted France for seeking to allow evidence obtained through <a href="/currentawareness/torture.php">torture</a> [JURIST news archive] in foreign countries, and for limiting terrorism suspects&#39; access to legal representation. HRW recommended several reforms, including redefining criminal association to terrorist activity, improving safeguards for suspects in police custody, and requiring investigating judges to order official inquiries into any allegation of police mistreatment. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/world/europe/03france.html?em&ex=1215230400&en=a6ebad9b74bece8c&ei=5087%0A">more</a>. Voice of America has <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-07-02-voa10.cfm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June 2007, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/france-terror-expulsion-policy-lacks.php">criticized France</a> [JURIST report] for expelling non-citizens accused of links to violent extremism, a practice it said undermined human rights. The report found the French procedure to be a way of expelling individuals through administrative action, bypassing the &quot;more stringent and procedural guarantees in the criminal justice system.&quot;

Last week, the US <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html?ref=world">agreed to eliminate legal immunity for US contractors</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/private-contractors-in-iraq-may-be.php">report</a>] from the proposed agreement, and suggested that it might concede US control of Iraqi airspace. The US is still pushing for immunity for US troops from prosecution in Iraqi courts and the right to hold detainees independent of Iraqi review. The two countries had set an informal deadline of July 31 to reach a permanent agreement, but have said they may have to adopt an interim deal to keep US troops in the country legally before the UN mandate authorizing the US troop presence <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">expires in December</a> [UN press release].

McClatchy has <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/42961.html">additional coverage</a>. Voices of Iraq has <a href="http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/english/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=84327&NrIssue=2&NrSection=1">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=nouri+al-maliki">news archive</a>] said some of the provisions the US is seeking would <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/iraq-pm-says-sovereignty-violated-by.php">violate Iraqi sovereignty</a> [JURIST report], but US President George Bush downplayed the disagreement, saying he thought the two countries would reach a deal before the deadline. The US has <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/sofa.htm">SOFAs</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] with many other countries around the world, and legal immunity for US troops is one of their most sought-after provisions. Immunity is a particularly divisive issue in Iraq, which has previously <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/iraq-will-ask-un-security-council-to.php">asked the UN to nullify</a> [JURIST report] the immunity granted to troops under the <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/381/16/PDF/N0438116.pdf?OpenElement">original mandate</a> [Security Council Resolution 1546] due to past misconduct by US soldiers, including the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=haditha">Haditha killings</a> of Iraqi civilians and the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal</a> [JURIST news archives]. Iraq has also asked the UN to lift the current provision allowing the US to <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/iraq-justice-minister-condemns-us.php">hold prisoners without Iraqi review</a> [JURIST news report].

The government argued that the NSA did not need to obtain a court order before eavesdropping on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Al-Haramain+charity">al-Haramain Islamic Foundation</a> [JURIST news archive] charity group because the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive] trumped procedural requirements under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FISA">news archive</a>], but US District Judge Vaughn Walker wrote: <blockquote>Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this regard, FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities and it limits the executive branch&#8217;s authority to assert the state secrets privilege in response to challenges to the legality of its foreign intelligence surveillance activities.</blockquote>Even so, Walker found that the charity had not established that it had standing to sue, since it was blocked from introducing a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-rules-against.php">leaked confidential call log</a> [JURIST report] as evidence of the alleged wiretap. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/washington/03fisa.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The original lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/islamic-charity-sues-to-shut-down-nsa.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] by the foundation in February 2006, alleged that the NSA illegally taped several conversations between the charity and its lawyers. In September 2006, lawyers for the US Department of Justice asked the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse a district court <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-lets-islamic-foundations.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] allowing the charity&#39;s lawsuit to proceed. Earlier that month, the lower court judge <a href="http://newsroom.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/178980-nsa.pdf">denied the government&#39;s motion to dismiss</a> [opinion, PDF], rejecting <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/doj-oregon-nsa-surveillance-suit-could.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] that the proceeding would reveal state secrets.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/2A67C56587DE89748825747A004D9E87/$file/0555294.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that the First Amendment protected an anti-abortion group&#39;s right to display graphic pictures of early-term aborted fetuses outside of a California middle school. The <a href="http://abortionno.org/index.html">Center for Bio-Ethical Reform</a> (CBER) [advocacy website], a pro-life advocacy group, filed a <a href="http://abortionno.org/pdf/Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in federal court in 2003 against the school and the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department after sheriff&#39;s deputies acting under <a href="http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/626.8.html">California Penal Code &sect; 626.8</a> [text] stopped two of its members for circling a Rancho Palos Verdes public school in a large truck plastered with the images. The court found that the deputies and the school were protected by the doctrine of <a href="http://www.robertslaw.org/qualifie.htm">qualified immunity</a> [backgrounder] with respect to the CBER&#39;s First Amendment violation claim, but it distinguished between constitutionally problematic statutes which criminalized expressive behavior based on the disruptive content of the expressed message, and those that criminalize disruptive means of expression. Judge Harry Pregerson wrote:<BLOCKQUOTE> As a whole, the language of &sect; 626.8 does not evidence any intent to criminalize a person&#8217;s behavior based on a listener&#8217;s reaction to the content of his speech. We thus conclude that the California courts would construe &sect; 626.8 to apply to speech only when the disruption caused by the speaker is caused by the manner of the speech. Controversial words and images that, because of their content, upset the listener and cause the listener to behave disruptively are not covered by the statute.<br /><br />Under our narrow construction, &sect; 626.8 does not apply to Plaintiffs&#8217; conduct in driving their trucks around Dodson Middle School....Construing &sect; 626.8 as we do, the statute provided no basis to prohibit Plaintiffs from continuing to drive their vehicles around the school before classes began.<br /><br />Section 626.8 was the only authority cited by Defendants in asking Plaintiffs to leave, and thus provided the only possible source of a significant governmental interest necessary to restrict Plaintiffs&#8217; speech in a public forum...Misapplying a statute is not a significant governmental interest. Defendants have suggested no other significant governmental interest to justify restricting Plaintiffs&#8217; speech. We therefore hold that the Deputy Sheriffs violated Plaintiffs&#8217; First Amendment right of free speech.</BLOCKQUOTE>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-abortion3-2008jul03,0,7097452.story">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Relying on a similar interpretation of the First Amendment, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in January <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-arizona.php">upheld the right of Arizona residents to purchase specialty license plates bearing the slogan &quot;Choose Life&quot;</a> [JURIST report]. That court <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/89B645323FA2ABF2882573DE005C3358/$file/0516971.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Arizona License Plate Commission violated the First Amendment free speech rights of the <a href="http://www.azchoose-life.org/">Arizona Life Coalition</a> (ALC) [advocacy website] when it refused an application to print the group&#39;s anti-abortion message on state-issued license plates in 2002. The court explained that the Commission&#39;s actions constituted viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment because they ultimately denied the ALC&#39;s application based on the content of their message.

In June 2006, Oric was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/icty-convicts-former-bosnian-commander.php">convicted of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] for failing to prevent the murder and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners in <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] by military police under his command. The ICTY appeals court ruled that Oric did not have control over most of the accused police at the time of the alleged crimes. It found that one subordinate was effectively under Oric&#39;s control at the time, but that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Oric knew or had reason to know that person would commit any war crimes. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gzMf5TP25p8ZMtqw04RJd6aaOYcwD91M9VP01">more</a>.

Oric was charged with failing to prevent abuses by military police under his command, and was also charged with responsibility for destruction of Serb villages around Srebrenica. He was sentenced to two years in prison, but was released immediately following his conviction as he had already been detained for two years. Former ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/icty-prosecutor-appeals-light-sentence.php">appealed the sentence</a> [JURIST report] in July 2006, after having called for an 18-year prison term.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.organojudicial.gob.pa/">Supreme Court of Panama</a> [Panama judiciary official website, in Spanish] has declared unconstitutional 183 pardons issued in 2004 by then-outgoing president <a href="http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_central_y_caribe/panama/mireya_moscoso_de_arias">Mireya Moscoso</a> [profile, in Spanish]. Among the pardoned had been four Cubans - including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Carriles">Luis Posada Carriles</a> [JURIST news archive] - charged with a 2000 assassination attempt against then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and 87 journalists charged with libel or defamation. The high court judges said Monday that some of the pardons were given before the defendants had actually stood trial. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN0119961420080701">more</a>. <em>Prensa</em> has <a href="http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2008/07/01/hoy/panorama/1426044.html">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />Carriles and three other Cubans were originally sentenced by a Panamanian court to up to eight years in prison for endangering public safety, possession of explosives and conspiracy in connection with a plan to assassinate Castro. In response, the Cuban government <a href="/paperchase/2004/08/panamanian-pardons-of-would-be-castro.htm">severed ties</a> [JURIST report] with Panama. After his pardon, Carriles was <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/cuban-bombing-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested in 2005</a> [JURIST report] for illegally entering the United States. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/anti-castro-militant-released-from-us.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007. Cuba <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/cuba-says-us-release-of-anti-castro.php">criticized Carriles&#39; release</a>, and accused the US of violating international anti-terrorism treaties by <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/court-dismisses-indictment-against-anti.php">dismissing US charges</a> [JURIST reports] against him. The US government has <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/us-judge-prevents-deportation-of-cuban.php">denied Cuban and Venezuelan requests</a> [JURIST report] for Carriles&#39; extradition, citing the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] as it claims that Carriles may face torture in Cuba or Venezuela.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] said Wednesday that it had mistakenly failed to brief the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on the existence of a <a href="http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/PL109-163.pdf">military law</a> [PDF text] allowing capital punishment for child rape before the court decided the case of <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/kenvlou">Kennedy v. Louisiana</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">report</a>]. In <em>Kennedy</em>, the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">held 5-4</a> [JURIST report] that a death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment when imposed for a crime in which the victim was not killed. The majority supported its reasoning by saying that very few states had such laws and that - incorrectly - there were no federal laws allowing the punishment for rape. In its admission, the DOJ noted that a 2006 amendment to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/stApIIch47.html">Uniform Code of Military Conduct</a> [LII materials] does in fact allow the death penalty at court-martial for rape and child rape. <a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/">Lousiana Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website] has said lawyers for the state are considering whether or not to petition the court to reconsider the case. The oversight <a href="http://caaflog.blogspot.com/2008/06/supremes-dis-military-justice-system.html">was first raised</a> [CAAFlog post] Saturday by a civilian Air Force lawyer in his blog on military justice. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/03/us/03scotus.html?hp">more</a>. The <em>Washington Times</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/03/louisiana-seizes-on-us-oversight/?page=1">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Supreme Court&#39;s holding reversed a 2007 <a href="http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2007/05ka1981.opn.pdf">decision</a> [PDF text] by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. The high court ruling has already been <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/child-rape-should-remain-punishable-by.php">criticized</a> by a wide range of lawmakers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced Wednesday that it will <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=12037">transfer two Guantanamo detainees</a> [press release] to Algeria. The unnamed individuals are among the more than 65 Guantanamo detainees that government officials have declared eligible for transfer. About 265 detainees remain at the base.<br /><br />Algerian Justice Minister Tayeb Belaiz indicated in March that officials from his country had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/algeria-officials-visit-guantanamo-bay.php">visited Guantanamo to identify Algerian detainees</a> [JURIST report], and said that although the country would accept repatriation of the 17 then still held there, some might face criminal charges upon their return. US officials have expressed concern that former detainees considered dangerous are not simply set free. Another Algerian, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Sufyian.pdf">Sufyian Barhoumi</a> [charge sheet, PDF] was among a group of three Guantanamo prisoners <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/pentagon-files-new-charges-against-3.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in May with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism based on alleged involvement with an al Qaeda bomb-making group in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200807/07-5139-1125074.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court ruling and found that <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) [NIMH backgrounder] may qualify as a disability under the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/rehabact.doc">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</a> [text, DOC]. The plaintiff in the case, Martin Desmond, alleged that he was forced to resign from the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/td/academy/sat/sat.htm">FBI New Agent Training Unit</a> [FBI backgrounder] in Quantico, VA when his superiors learned that he suffered from PTSD. Desmond argued that his dismissal from the program constituted discrimination based on disability, in violation of Section 501 of the Act. In its ruling, the court explained that under the Rehabilitation Act a plaintiff is disabled if &quot;(1) he suffers from an impairment; (2) the impairment limits an activity that constitutes a major life activity under the Act; and (3) the limitation is substantial.&quot; Finding that PTSD qualified as a &quot;mental impairment&quot; and that sleep constituted a &quot;major life activity,&quot; the court concluded that the condition was covered by the Act where evidence of significant sleeplessness exists. The case was remanded for further proceedings. <br /><br />The Rehabilitation Act, administered by the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/osers/rsa/index.html">Rehabilitation Services Administration</a> [official website], was passed in 1973 to prevent discrimination based on disability in government agencies and federally funded programs, and foreshadowed broader legislation like the 1990 <a href="http://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> [official website] and other measures aimed at increasing protection for people with disabilities in the workplace. Last week, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/house-passes-americans-with.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.03195:">Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008</a> [HR 3195 materials], which will make it easier for employees with mental or physical handicaps to prove they are victims of employment discrimination. Supporters of the bill contend that the Supreme Court has interpreted the ADA in an overly restrictive manner, denying protection to a wide range of disabilities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1418-ENG.pdf">ordered the release</a> [decision, PDF; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/394.html">press release</a>] of Congolese ex-militia leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/RDC/c0106.html">Thomas Lubanga</a> [ICC materials; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6131516.stm">profile</a>] after finding that past prosecutorial misconduct would prevent him from having a fair trial.  The release order will go into effect in five days, barring an appeal by prosecutors and assuming the completion of transfer arrangements with a &quot;state that is obliged to receive him.&quot;  The court explained:<blockquote>[T]he Chamber has concluded that the logical - indeed the inevitable - consequence of the Decision is that the only correct course is to order the release of the accused, because, consistent with the Decision and on the basis of the available information, a fair trial of the accused is impossible, and the entire justification for his detention has been removed. It would be unlawful for the Chamber to order him to remain in what, in reality, would be preventative detention or to impose conditional release.</blockquote>  Last month, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1401-ENG.pdf">imposed an indefinite stay</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/icc-reluctantly-stays-trial-of-congo-ex.php">report</a>] on Lubanga&#39;s war crimes trial after it accused the prosecution of using confidentiality agreements to withhold possible exonerating evidence.  The Chief Prosecutor later filed a  <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1407-ENG.pdf">petition</a> [PDF text] asking the court not to consider releasing Lubanga and seeking leave to appeal the indefinite stay.  On Wednesday, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1417-ENG.pdf">granted leave to appeal</a> [decision, PDF].<br /><br />Once the leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/upc.htm">Union of Patriotic Congolese</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], Lubanga is <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">charged with using child soldiers</a> [JURIST report; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2772575.stm">report</a>] in his militia, which is believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in Congo&#39;s violent <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2003/ituri0703/">Ituri district</a> [HRW backgrounder]. He became the <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/congo-militia-leader-makes-first.php">first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC</a> after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2006. Lubanga&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/icc-delays-trial-of-congo-militia.php">long-delayed trial</a> [JURIST report] was scheduled to be the ICC&#39;s first since its creation in 2002.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Washington DC police are launching a new voluntary program to reduce the number of guns in the city after the US Supreme Court  <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">ruled</a>  [JURIST report] last month that a city ban on private handgun ownership violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Second Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution. Under the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/12/AR2008031202717.html">Safe Homes Initiative</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report], police will ask residents for permission to search their homes for guns and residents will receive amnesty from prosecution for any weapons confiscated under the program. Critics allege that the program could amount to a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] right against unreasonable search and seizure if homeowners are intimidated into allowing the searches. The <a href="http://aclu-nca.org/">Washington DC chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] has distributed <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/docs/know_your_rights.doc">flyers</a> [DOC text] advising DC residents of their constitutional rights.  NBC has <a href="http://www.nbc4.com/news/15688264/detail.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Other cities are considering similar programs following the Supreme Court ruling.  Gun ownership advocacy groups have filed lawsuits in <a href="http://207.41.16.133/rfcViewFile/08cv3645comp.pdf">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/859084/NRA-v-San-Francisco-Housing-Authority-complaint">San Francisco</a> [court documents; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawsuits-seek-to-overturn-gun-bans.php">report</a>] seeking to overturn laws which ban handguns within those cities.  In September 2007, <a href="http://dc.gov/mayor/bios/fenty.shtm">Washington DC Mayor Adrian M. Fenty</a> and <a href="http://occ.dc.gov/occ/cwp/view.asp?a=3&Q=637262&PM=1occNav_GID,1522,occNav,|31705|,.asp">DC Attorney General Linda Singer</a> [official profiles] formally <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/dc-formally-appeals-handgun-ban-ruling.php">appealed</a> a March 2007 federal court ruling which <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-dc.php">invalidated the District of Columbia&#39;s handgun ban</a> [JURIST reports].  The Supreme Court affirmed a March DC Circuit <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200703/04-7041a.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that the city&#39;s 30-year-old ban on private possession of handguns was unconstitutionally broad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Belgium&#39;s <a href="http://www.cass.be/pyramide_fr2.php">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French] Tuesday approved the transfer of former <a href="/countries/congo.php">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [JURIST news archive] rebel leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/RCA/c0108.html">Jean-Pierre Bemba</a> [ICC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bemba">news archive</a>] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] where he will face prosecution for war crimes. Bemba, who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested by Belgian authorities</a> [JURIST report] in May, had challenged the move by alleging that authorities did not follow proper procedures. The ICC has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-05-01-08-1-FRA.pdf">indicted</a> [arrest warrant, PDF, in French; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-05-01-08-5-FRA.pdf">decision to unseal</a>, PDF, in French]  Bemba on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder] between October 2002 and March 2003. Prosecutors say he is responsible for rape, torture, outrages upon personal dignity, and pillaging.  Bemba&#39;s arrest warrant is the first issued by the ICC in its investigation of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/371.html">large-scale sexual offenses</a> [ICC press release] in the CAR. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iH3_oKv2qGOw-Z5mSSXcXXdh4SkA">more</a>. IWPR has <a href="http://www.iwpr.net/?p=acr&s=f&o=345495&apc_state=henh">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Bemba, now a member of the Congolese Senate, was elected to his office after losing a <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-election-panel-announces-run-off.php">run-off presidential election</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1123006.stm">Joseph Kabila</a> [BBC profile], who in December 2006 became the first freely-elected president of the DRC since 1960. After the election, Bemba&#39;s private militia force led a violent campaign against government troops until the DRC Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-high-court-dismisses.php">rejected his election challenge</a> [JURIST report]. In the process, Bemba&#39;s supporters <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-supreme-court-building-set.php">set fire to the Supreme Court building</a> [JURIST report]. Following the clashes, the chief prosecutor of the DRC <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/congo-chief-prosecutor-orders-arrest-of.php">issued a warrant for Bemba&#39;s arrest</a> [JURIST report], and he fled to Europe. A court in CAR referred the <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/central-african-republic-court-refers.php">original war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC in April 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Private security contractors operating in Iraq will no longer receive immunity from prosecution under a US-Iraqi agreement now in negotiation, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told AFP Tuesday.  Contractors have  worked largely above the law due to legal loopholes because the US government <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040627_CPAORD_17_Status_of_Coalition__Rev__with_Annex_A.pdf">exempted its employees and contractors from Iraqi law</a> [order, PDF] when Iraq was still under US administration.  Even though Iraq has since formed its own government, the exemption still applies and has been a source of tension between the US and Iraqi governments.  Criticism of the exemption intensified in January after the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp-doj.php">shooting death of at least eight Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of private security contractor <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website].  AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gr71LvzNq75h_QC3cpJ5_t3ycXyw">more</a>.<br /><br />During a private meeting in December, DOJ officials reportedly told Congress that <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp-doj.php">numerous legal hurdles</a> [JURIST report] would have to be overcome before Blackwater employees could be charged with any crimes. The Blackwater allegations have caused domestic outrage in Iraq and have prompted legal controversy in the US. In November, the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em> reported that an FBI investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> {JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A divison of the New York State Supreme Court&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2008/2008_05970.htm">dismissed</a> [decision] remaining charges against former <a href="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) [official website] CEO <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3119030.stm">Richard Grasso</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=grasso">news archive</a>] on Tuesday. Former NY Attorney General Eliot Spitzer had brought six charges against Grasso over his controversial $187.5 million compensation package from NYSE.  Four of the charges were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/new-york-appeals-court-dismisses-most.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007. The two remaining charges against Grasso involved violations of state law regarding not-for-profit corporations. In the dismissing the charges against Grasso, Associate Justice James McGuire wrote:<blockquote>Here, the Attorney General is using public funds out of appropriations to his office to prosecute causes of action on behalf of an entity that is no longer a not-for-profit corporation and seeks only a money judgment that would benefit the owners of the for-profit entity into which the not-for-profit has been converted (even if the judgment nominally would be paid to the not-for-profit corporation). The Attorney General&#39;s continued prosecution of these causes of action ... vindicates no public purpose.</blockquote> NY <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Attorney General Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile] announced that the AG&#39;s office <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/01/AR2008070101390.html?hpid=moreheadlines">will not appeal Tuesday&#39;s decision</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] to dismiss the remaining charges.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/business/02grasso.html?_r=1&ref=business&oref=slogin">more</a>.<br /><br />Grasso was forced out of his position as CEO of the NYSE after public outcry over his compensation package. Spitzer and the state of New York had argued in the <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2004/may/may24a_04_attach.pdf">complaint against Grasso</a> [text, PDF] that the amount of the compensation package was unreasonably high and violated state non-profit law.  Grasso fought the charges in court, contending that NYSE directors were aware of his pay, and had approved it. In October 2006, a NY court <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/ex-nyse-chairman-grasso-ordered-to.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Grasso to pay back a major portion of the compensation he earned as CEO between 1995 and 2003.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A proposed Ethiopian law regulating non-governmental organizations, which it terms Civil Society Organizations (CSO), would severely undermine human rights efforts in the country, according to two separate reports issued Tuesday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/africa/HRW.NGO.Law.Analysis.pdf">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/africa/HRW.NGO.Law.Analysis.pdf">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [PDF texts; joint <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/06/30/ethiop19228.htm">press release</a>].  The groups said that Ethiopia&#39;s <a href="http://mahder.com/the-implications-of-the-draft-charities-and-societies-proclamation-for-ehrco.html">Charities and Societies Proclamation</a> [Mahder.com backgrounder] would bar foreign CSOs from engaging in human rights work and block Ethiopian CSOs from accepting foreign funding.  The provision could result in the complete shutdown of all aid groups not expressly approved by the government.  The law would also create a Charities and Societies Agency with broad authority to interfere in CSO internal workings and to ban any CSO that failed to meet government specifications.  HRW&#39;s <a href="http://www.hrw.org/pub/2008/africa/HRW.NGO.Law.Analysis.pdf">analysis of the law</a> [PDF, text] stated: <blockquote>The CSA and numerous government ministries would have enormous discretionary powers to refuse to accord legal recognition to CSOs, to disband CSOs that have already been legally recognized, to subject CSOs to intrusive patterns of surveillance, and to interfere in the management and staffing of CSOs up to the point of altering their organizational missions.</blockquote> Amnesty and HRW alleged that the proposition violated both international law and freedoms enshrined in Ethiopia&#39;s own constitution. AfrolNews has <a href="http://www.afrol.com/articles/29647">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, HRW <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/ethiopia0608/ethiopia0608web.pdf">reported</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ethiopia-ethnic-separatists-targets-of.php">report</a>] on human rights violations committed by both the Ethiopian military and the ethnic Somali group the <a href="http://www.onlf.org/">Ogaden National Liberation Front</a> [group website] in the eastern Ogaden region.  In October 2007, the US House of Representatives passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:2:./temp/~c110lHCyXp::">Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> (HR 2003) [text; JURIST <a href="/forumy/2008/01/linking-rights-and-foreign-aid-for.php">commentary</a>], aimed in part at encouraging the human rights situation in Ethiopia. The bill is currently before the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. In July 2007, HRW accused Ethiopian troops of <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/ethiopia-military-crackdown-on-rebels.php">violating international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report] by burning homes and forcibly relocating civilians in Ogaden.  In March 2007, HRW also accused Ethiopia of complicity with the US and Kenya in <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">secretly detaining Somalis</a> [JURIST report] accused of being Islamic militants. Ethiopia had <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/ethiopia-admits-to-detaining-terror.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 that it detained terror suspects but denied that the detentions were secret.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.associazionemagistrati.it/">National Association of Magistrates</a>  [organization website, in Italian] voted Saturday to <a href="http://www.associazionemagistrati.it/articolo.php?id=1727">proclaim</a> [text, in Italian] a &quot;state of agitation,&quot; preparing for a possible strike over anticipated judicial budget cuts by the government of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>].  Judges argued that the proposed cuts would drastically reduce the judiciary&#39;s ability to combat lawlessness.  The judges also expressed frustration over government efforts to finalize <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-senate-approves-legislation.php">legislation</a>  that would suspend ongoing <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/italy-corruption-trial-of-ex-pm.php">corruption proceedings</a> [JURIST reports] against Berlusconi. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h8v82QabViSW3C_YTD0regxIE7SA">more</a>.<br /><br />The Italian government also plans to propose a bill that would protect high-ranking government officials from prosecution during their terms in office. Berlusconi, thought to be Italy&#39;s richest man, has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports]. In October 2007, Italy&#39;s highest court of appeal <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/italy-high-court-upholds-berlusconi.php">upheld</a> Berlusconi&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/berlusconi-acquitted-of-bribery-charges.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery charges. That trial was initially blocked in 2004 by a bill drafted by Berlusconi ally and later defense lawyer Gaetano Pecorella but went ahead after the bill was struck down as unconstitutional. Berlusconi has denied guilt and accused prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him.

The country&#39;s majority Islamic <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] has alleged that the generals belong to secular extremist group <a href="http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=108986">Ergenekon</a> [<em>Turkish Daily News</em> backgrounder], which is suspected of involvement in bombings, political assassination plots, and the death of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/foreign_affairs_committee.cfm">House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [official website] Sunday called &quot;deplorable&quot; what it termed &quot;false US assurances&quot; about rendition flights through the UK Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia and said the &quot;failure of the United States Administration to tell the truth resulted in the UK Government inadvertently misleading&quot; the committee and the House of Commons about US operations on a <a href="http://www.dg.navy.mil/web/">military base</a> [official website] located on the island. In a new <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/14705.htm">report</a> [text] it said it would conduct a further investigation of UK supervision of US activities on Diego Garcia, including all flights and ships serviced there. In February UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs David Miliband said that two US planes landed on Diego Garcia in 2002 to refuel <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/cia-rendition-flights-refueled-on-uk.php">during extraordinary rendition flights</a> [JURIST report]. Miliband <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1007029391629&a=KArticle&aid=1199215094287">apologized</a> [text] for previously denying that such stops had been made. His statement followed an <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/past-use-of-diego-garcia.html">admission</a> [text] by US CIA Director Michael Hayden, who said the information on the renditions to Guantanamo Bay and Morocco was discovered in late 2007 after the CIA reviewed records on the renditions. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080705/D91O0G600.html">more</a>. <br /><br />Lawyers for <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], a UK legal charity representing some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/FinalReprieveSubmissionFASC.pdf">alleged</a> [report, PDF] last year that UK overseas territories have been used &quot;to support illegal interstate transfer, enforced disappearance and torture in the context of the &#39;war on terror&#39;&quot; and urged UK lawmakers to question US and UK officials about the allegations. In 2005, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak said there had been allegations that the US was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/un-torture-investigator-us-may-be.php">secretly detaining prisoners on military vessels</a> [JURIST report] at the Diego Garcia naval base.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A class of plaintiffs suing several dozen US companies which did business in South Africa during <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=apartheid">apartheid</a> [JURIST news archive] will ask to narrow their claims Tuesday in a status conference to be held in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The plaintiffs are South Africans seeking to hold the businesses liable under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1350.notes.html">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> (ATCA) [text] based on alleged complicity in perpetuating the oppression of the black majority in that country.  In 2003, the South African government issued a <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/apartheid.pdf">statement</a> [PDF text] of its position on substantially similar litigation then in US courts, calling it &quot;inconsistent with South Africa&#39;s approach to achieving its long term goals.&quot; Global Research has <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=9515">more</a>.<br /><br />The case returns to the SDNY after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/orders-mon-05-12.pdf">affirmed</a> [PDF text] a Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA1LTIxNDEtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/05-2141-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irldf4e/5/hilite">judgment</a> [PDF, text] in May on the rare grounds that it <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/supreme-court-affirms-ruling-allowing.php">lacked a quorum</a> [JURIST report] due to four recusals. The Second Circuit&#39;s decision allowed the ATCA action to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-appeals-court-allows-apartheid.php">go forward</a> to trial [JURIST report], but had dismissed additional claims filed under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act</a> [text].  The Supreme Court&#39;s recusals were <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002109----000-.html">statutorily required</a> [text] because several justices had financial conflicts, but raised fairness concerns and brought about discussion as to possible effects on future cases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A new tool for measuring adherence to the rule of law developed by the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/wjp/">World Justice Project</a> (WJP) [advocacy website] was presented at the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/wjp/docs/abawjp_forumagenda_05-30-08.pdf">World Justice Forum</a> [PDF agenda] in Vienna Thursday.  The development of the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/wjp/rolindex.html">Rule of Law Index</a> [WJP backgrounder] was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> [profession website] and is based on <a href="http://www.abanet.org/wjp/about.html">principles</a> [WJP mission statement] which emphasize the relationship between the rule of law and the quality of people&#39;s everyday lives. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxnXdiQFlkrWlI4QPPK43xeteKiQD91MEVSG2">more</a>.<br /><br />Developing a more quantitatively-oriented assessment tool was deemed important because dictators often use the language of democracy to legitimize their actions.  In its <a href="http://hrw.org/wr2k8/">World Report 2008</a> [HRW index], <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]  criticized established democracies for not doing enough to expose dubious democratic claims by authoritarian regimes.

Eleonore Geer-Brakke, Bouterse&#39;s ex-secretary, also testified that Bouterse was at Fort Zeelandia on the day of the killings. Bouterse has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/suriname-tribunal-backs-charges-against.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] along with 24 others in connection with the deaths. The former dictator has staunchly denied his involvement, insisting that he was not present at the military compound at the time of the shootings. Bouterse faces up to 20 years in prison. <br /><br />Bouterse seized control of northeastern South American state of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suriname">Suriname</a> [JURIST news archive] during a military coup in 1980, five years after the country achieved independence from the Netherlands. He stepped down in 1987 in the face of international pressure and briefly seized power in 1991. He is now the leader of the county&#8217;s primary opposition party, the <a href="http://www.ndp.sr/">National Democratic Party</a> [official website, in Dutch], which is preparing for the 2010 presidential elections.

A 13-judge panel headed by current Chief Justice Abdul Hamid Dogar upheld Musharraf&#8217;s actions in November 2007 as &#8220;inevitable&#8221; in order to prevent &quot;chaos and anarchy.&#8221; Friday&#8217;s decision confirmed an <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/reconstituted-pakistan-high-court.php">earlier judgment</a> [JURIST report] by the same Supreme Court upholding Musharraf&#39;s declaration of emergency rule as constitutional. <br /><br />Musharraf&#39;s emergency declaration - now rescinded - effectively dismissed the pre-emergency Supreme Court bench led by Chaudhry. The ousted judges have since been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ousted-pakistan-judges-involuntarily.php">formally retired</a> [JURIST report], although they and their supporters insist that they still legally hold office under Pakistan&#39;s constitution.

ICC prosecutors say he is responsible for rape, torture, outrages upon personal dignity, and pillaging. Bemba&#39;s arrest warrant is the first issued by the ICC in its investigation of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/371.html">large-scale sexual offenses</a> [ICC press release] in the CAR. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/world/africa/05hague.html?ref=world">more</a>. BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7490484.stm">additional coverage</a>. <br /><br />Bemba, now a member of the Congolese Senate, was elected to office after losing a <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-election-panel-announces-run-off.php">run-off presidential election</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1123006.stm">Joseph Kabila</a> [BBC profile], who in December 2006 became the first freely-elected president of the DRC since 1960. After the election, Bemba&#39;s private militia force led a violent campaign against government troops until the DRC Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-high-court-dismisses.php">rejected his election challenge</a> [JURIST report]. In the process, Bemba&#39;s supporters <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-supreme-court-building-set.php">set fire to the Supreme Court building</a> [JURIST report]. Following the clashes, the chief prosecutor of the DRC <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/congo-chief-prosecutor-orders-arrest-of.php">issued a warrant for Bemba&#39;s arrest</a> [JURIST report], and he fled to Europe.

US District Judge Stephen Larson declined to rescind his contempt rulings, but released the Marines after their attorneys argued that the detentions would never compel them to testify.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] told journalists Thursday that the trial of Congolese ex-militia leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/RDC/c0106.html">Thomas Lubanga</a> [ICC materials; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6131516.stm">BBC profile</a>] would proceed as planned after evidentiary problems which had threatened the case were settled, according to AFP. Late last month, the ICC imposed an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1401-ENG.pdf">indefinite stay</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/icc-reluctantly-stays-trial-of-congo-ex.php">report</a>] on Lubanga&#39;s war crimes trial after it found that the prosecution had used confidentiality agreements to withhold possible exonerating evidence and concluded that Lubanga would be unable to receive a fair trial. The court subsequently ordered Lubanga set free but agreed to suspend his release for five days, giving the prosecution time to appeal. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-04-01-06-1419-ENG.pdf">appeal</a> [PDF], filed Wednesday, requested an indefinite suspension of Lubanga&#39;s release while the procedural issues concerning its use of the confidentiality agreements were addressed. The prosecution contends that the previously withheld evidence has now been released to all parties involved in the trial. AFP quoted ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/presidency/president.html">President Judge Philippe Kirsch</a> [official profile] as saying that the procedural issues would be resolved &quot;shortly&quot;. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gQGK2tNGAOlXUja4LCbnrDRcY-0A">more</a>.<br /><br />Once the leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/upc.htm">Union of Patriotic Congolese</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], Lubanga is <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">charged with using child soldiers</a> [JURIST report; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2772575.stm">report</a>] in his militia, which is believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in Congo&#39;s violent <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2003/ituri0703/">Ituri district</a> [HRW backgrounder]. He became the <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/congo-militia-leader-makes-first.php">first war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC</a> after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2006. Lubanga&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/icc-delays-trial-of-congo-militia.php">long-delayed trial</a> [JURIST report] is scheduled to be the ICC&#39;s first since its creation in 2002.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] White House Press Secretary Dana Perino <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080703-8.html">said</a> [press briefing transcript] Thursday that the administration is still working to close the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay detention center</a> [JURIST news archive], but suggested that a recent US Supreme Court decision could lead to the release of &quot;dangerous detainees&quot; into the US. The Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> last month that &quot;enemy combatants&quot; have the right to challenge their detention by <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-assigns-judges-to.php">filing habeas corpus petitions in federal court</a> [JURIST report]. Perino said that if a detainee successfully challenged their detention and couldn&#39;t be repatriated to their home country, they could either be immediately released into the US or held for no longer than six months under current immigration laws. She said the administration was still deciding how to close the base and comply with the decision:<blockquote>...The Department of Defense has been working for years to try to get many of these enemy combatants repatriated, and in fact we&#39;ve gotten hundreds repatriated back to their country where they would be held securely. But some detainees have been released, and some have returned to the battlefield, and some have even become suicide bombers. And we have to be really careful about what we&#39;re going to do with these detainees...<br /><br />But there is considered judgment from many federal government lawyers, all the way up to the Attorney General of the United States, that it is a very real possibility that a dangerous detainee could be released into the United States as a result of this Supreme Court decision...<br /><br />I&#39;m sure that none of us want Khalid Sheikh Mohammed walking around our neighborhoods. And there might be some lawyers that you can find that would say that&#39;s a stretch, but what I would submit to you is that they don&#39;t know either, and that the Attorney General of the United States, who has been intimately involved in trying these types of cases, and in fact oversaw the first World Trade Center bombing case, he&#39;s very concerned about the situation. And so you can bet that he is at the table as well, trying to figure this out so we make sure that we don&#39;t endanger any citizen of the United States.</blockquote>Perino and other administration officials have said that one solution would be new legislation preventing the release of detainees while deportation hearings are held.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/keyfacts/list_judiciary/biographies/lord_chief.htm">Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=UK+phillips">news archive</a>] said Thursday that there may be applications of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/#2">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder] in the British legal system during a <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/speeches/lcj_equality_before_the_law_030708.pdf">speech</a> [PDF text] at the <a href="http://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/?page=resources">East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre</a> [official website]. Phillips&#39; comments were in support of the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/about/bio.html">Rowan Williams</a> [official profile], who controversially said earlier this year that certain aspects of Sharia <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/brown-rejects-sharia-law-for-uk-muslims.php">could be applied to resolve some civil disputes</a> [JURIST report] between British Muslims. Phillips said:<BLOCKQUOTE>there is widespread misunderstanding in this country as to the nature of Sharia law. Sharia consists of a set of principles governing the way that one should live one&#8217;s life in accordance with the will of God. These principles are based on the Qu&#8217;ran, as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad and interpreted by Islamic scholars. The principles have much in common with those of other religions. They do not include forced marriage or the repression of women. Compliance with them requires a high level of personal conduct, including abstinence from alcohol. I understand that it is not the case that for a Muslim to lead his or her life in accordance with these principles will be in conflict with the requirements of the law in this country.<br /><br />What would be in conflict with the law would be to impose certain sanctions for failure to comply with Sharia principles. Part of the misconception about Sharia law is the belief that Sharia is only about mandating sanctions such as flogging, stoning, the cutting off of hands, or death for those who fail to comply with the law. And the view of many of Sharia law is coloured by violent extremists who invoke it, perversely, to justify terrorist atrocities such as suicide bombing, which I understand to be in conflict with Islamic principles. There can be no question of such sanctions being applied to or by any Muslim who lives within this jurisdiction. Nor, when I was in Oman, did I find that such penalties formed any part of the law applied there. It is true that they have the death penalty for that intentional murder, but they do not apply any of the other forms of corporal punishment I have just listed.<br /><br />It remains the fact that in Muslim countries where the law is founded on Sharia principles, the law includes sanctions for failure to observe those principles and there are courts to try those who are alleged to have breached those laws. The definition of the law and the sanctions to be applied for breach of it differ from one Muslim country to another. In some countries the courts interpret Sharia Law as calling for severe physical punishment. There can be no question of such courts sitting in this country, or such sanctions being applied here. So far as the law is concerned, those who live in this country are governed by English law and subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts.... <br /><br />[But i]t was not very radical [for Archbishop Williams] to advocate embracing Sharia Law in the context of family disputes, for example, and our system already goes a long way towards accommodating the Archbishop&#8217;s suggestion. It is possible in this country for those who are entering into a contractual agreement to agree that the agreement shall be governed by a law other than English law. Those who, in this country, are in dispute as to their respective rights are free to subject that dispute to the mediation of a chosen person, or to agree that the dispute shall be resolved by a chosen arbitrator or arbitrators. There is no reason why principles of Sharia Law, or any other religious code should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution. It must be recognised, however, that any sanctions for a failure to comply with the agreed terms of the mediation would be drawn from the laws of England and Wales. So far as aspects of matrimonial law are concerned, there is a limited precedent for English law to recognise aspects of religious laws, although when it comes to divorce this can only be effected in accordance with the civil law of this country.<br /><br />Those who provide financial services in this country are subject to regulation in order to protect their customers and that regulation accommodates financial institutions or products that comply with Sharia principles. There are three Islamic banks authorised by the Financial Services Authority to carry on business in the United Kingdom. A number of Sukuk issues have been listed on the London Stock Exchange. In May this year Europe&#8217;s first Islamic insurance company or &#8220;takaful&#8221; provider was authorised by the Financial Services Authority.</BLOCKQUOTE>Some members of the British parliament expressed concern over Phillips&#39; comments, saying that Sharia would be divisive and could lead to alienation of the Muslim community in Britain.

The comments <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7235550.stm">sparked outrage</a> [BBC report] both from social conservatives, who maintain that UK law should be exclusively based on Christianity, and from liberals, who fear that implementation of Sharia law might hurt the rights of women and homosexuals. In response to Williams, Prime Minister Gordon Brown <a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page14504.asp">rejected the suggestion</a> [press briefing] that UK Muslims be given an option to resolve some civil disputes under Sharia law rather than UK law.

With the expectation and hope that they will be incentivized to cooperate to resolving the crisis of legitimacy, to creating a government there that represents &#8211; genuinely represents the legitimate representatives of the people of Zimbabwe.</blockquote>The draft calls for Zimbabwe&#39;s government to accept mediation efforts by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa-union.org%2F&ei=32ttSPeNNpTyeebTrdIC&usg=AFQjCNFhQ6FZ1FsJ5Ucd9iSL-6WdnWJ_jw&sig2=ti6dFZ8owz_o3h7tRfpv9Q">African Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sadc.int%2F&ei=NmxtSN6sBY6seb7K7NoC&usg=AFQjCNE6nrfIhzm0WxDwzc-L5QcjHpu42w&sig2=9pVDtcw-bUD8IPQx28zzag">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC), and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official websites].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] Thursday <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=25092&&name=n&&currPage=1&&Active=1">blasted</a> [press release] a proposed plan that would allow <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] agents to consider a person&#39;s race, religion, or ethnicity in deciding whether to open a terrorism investigation. CAIR decried the plan as &quot;unconstitutional and un-American,&quot; saying that it could allow security agents to target Muslims and Arab-Americans for harassment. A US Department of Justice spokesman responding to press reports on the plan - which has neither been finalized nor formally announced - denied that the new guidelines would allow profiling, noting that ethnicity is only one of many factors to be considered and that it is only when all those factors as a whole are deemed suspicious that an investigation can be opened. Under the proposed guidelines as explained to AP by unnamed sources, agents would be able to initiate investigations even in instances where there is no evidence of a crime, something required under current guidelines. AP has <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/wireStory?id=5294541">more</a>. Fox News has <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,375542,00.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Rights complaints by Muslims in the US rose 25 percent in 2006, according to an <a href="http://www.cair.com/pdf/2007-Civil-Rights-Report.pdf">annual report on civil rights</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.cair.com/default.asp?Page=articleView&id=2781&theType=NR">press release</a>] released by CAIR last year. The group attributed the jump to a rise in anti-Muslim bias. The majority of reported complaints came against government agencies, including the DOJ.

A major impediment to the negotiated release and repatriation of Yemeni detainees - who make up the largest single group of nationals at the prison - has been concern that they might be freed on their return to their home country, but AP quoted a senior official with Yemen&#39;s <a href="http://www.mhryemen.org/index_en.php">Ministry of Human Rights</a> [official website] as saying that the US has been assured that any returned detainees suspected of terrorism will be prosecuted. There are currently close to 100 Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo, and talks concerning an agreement between the Yemeni and US governments on the return of the Yemeni prisoners have been ongoing. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g-L-KX-wfA4ZYyk22gBXb2cwQubgD91METUG0">more</a>. <em>Saba</em> has <a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news158033.htm">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In October 2007, US officials <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/yemen-official-denies-release-of-uss.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] reports that the Yemeni government had released suspected <em>USS Cole</em> bomber <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/jamal_al_badawi.htm">Jamal al-Badawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile] after he turned himself in. In May 2007, a senior Yemeni official said that the country had <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/yemen-agrees-to-take-most-yemeni.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to receive most Yemeni detainees being held at Guantanamo. In June 2006, Yemeni officials <A src="/paperchase/2006/06/yemen-calls-for-probe-into-guantanamo.php">called for investigations</A> into the Guantanamo suicides of <A src="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">three detainees</A> [JURIST reports], including one Yemeni national, saying that the deaths exemplified the &quot;inhumane conditions of detainees&quot; at the US military prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Italian government Thursday began carrying out a controversial plan to fingerprint the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> [JURIST news archive], despite fierce <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-plan-to-fingerprint-roma.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1315385&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">international human rights community</a> [COE statement] and <a href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2958">Roma advocates</a> [ERRC materials]. The fingerprinting scheme, announced last Thursday by <a href="http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,3438,en_21571361_34360727_34508996_1_1_1_1,00.html">Interior Minister Roberto Maroni</a> [OECD profile], involves recording the fingerprints of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging. According to some reports, the Italian Interior Ministry has said that fingerprints will not be taken from any Roma who has Italian or EU documentation. The plan has been condemned as constituting &quot;<a href="http://euobserver.com/22/26408">ethnic cataloguing</a>&quot; [EUobserver.com report]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iCXe61_aGppiJaspRhnl61yzNi1wD91MEUR07">more</a>.<br /><br />Vincenzo Spadafora, head of <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/italy.html">UNICEF in Italy</a> [official website], said UNICEF was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the proposal, commenting that &quot;[i]f this is being brought in to protect the rights of Roma children, Italian children should also be fingerprinted to protect them as well.&quot; On Monday, the Italian Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-court-overrules-racial-hatred.php">released a ruling</a> [JURIST report] overturning the convictions of six Italians, including Verona Mayor Flavio Tosi, for distributing anti-Roma literature in 2001 in a move some speculated was timed to bolster the fingerprinting plan. In November 2005, the <a href="http://www.eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php">European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia</a> (EUMC) [advocacy website] reported that Roma minorities are the ethnic group <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/roma-facing-most-prejudice-in-european.php">most susceptible to racism in the European Union </a>[JURIST report]. A spokesman for an Italian NGO opposed to fingerprinting said Thursday that life expectancy for Roma living in Italy is already <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.2307678589">under 60</a> [AKI report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Moscow court Monday rejected an attempt by relatives of Polish victims of the 1940 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/01/spotlight/index.html">Katyn massacre</a> [CNN backgrounder; Poland <a href="http://www.poland.gov.pl/The,Katyn,Massacre,2579.html">backgrounder</a>] to renew investigations into the killings. The government of <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/books/story/0,,538550,00.html">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile] admitted in 1990 that Josef Stalin had personally <a href="http://katyn.codis.ru/kdocs1.htm">ordered</a> [documents, in Russian] the secret police to carry out the killings. Russia had previously blamed the Nazis for the incident, in which more than 20,000 Polish Army reservists, academics and politicians were killed in the Katyn Forest in present-day Belarus, as well as other locations. The Moscow City Court&#39;s Monday ruling upheld an earlier lower court <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080527/108613306.html">ruling</a> [RIA Novosti report] denying the appeal. A lawyer for the family members said they will appeal to the district military court. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL07252897">more</a>.<br /><br />The Polish <a href="http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/en/">Institute of National Remembrance</a> [official website] has long sought to convince the Russian government to apply its law on the &quot;rehabilitation of victims of political repressions&quot; to the Katyn victims, but suits have so far been unsuccessful.  Russia&#39;s own 10-year investigation of the massacre ended in 2004 when the government closed its classified files and said the crime&#39;s statute of limitations had expired.  In 2006, the families filed a <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/poles-filing-echr-complaint-against.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website], asking it to classify the incident as genocide and compel the Russian government to disclose its information.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An <em>en-banc</em> panel of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] Wednesday released a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/Documents.nsf/54dbe3fb372dcb6c88256ce50065fcb8/706cfc8a9f0494f38825747a00662dd7/$FILE/0735000.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF text] granting broad deference to the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a> (NFS) [official website] when making decisions regarding the impact of logging on national forests.  The ruling comes in a case brought by environmental groups <a href="http://www.landscouncil.org/">Lands Council</a> and the <a href="http://www.wildwestinstitute.org/">Wild West Institute</a> [advocacy websites] to enjoin the NFS from instituting a proposed logging plan in <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/ipnf/">Idaho Panhandle National Forest</a> [official website].   The court Wednesday held that under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/ch5.html">Administrative Procedures Act</a> [statute text; provision <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000706----000-.html">text</a>], it could only overturn NFS decisions on these matters of they were &quot;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,&quot; a  standard that had not been met in this case:<blockquote>In essence, Lands Council asks this court to act as a panel of scientists that instructs the Forest Service how to validate its hypotheses regarding wildlife viability, chooses among scientific studies in determining whether the Forest Service has complied with the underlying Forest Plan, and orders the agency to explain every possible scientific uncertainty... this is not a proper role for a federal appellate court.  But Lands Council&#8217;s arguments illustrate how, in recent years, our environmental jurisprudence has, at times, shifted away from the appropriate standard of review and could be read to suggest that this court should play such a role...  Today, we correct those errors.</blockquote> The court set a new standard of authority which overturned a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/AD80E02F50359F82882570D0007C6849/$file/0335995.pdf?openelement">2005 ruling</a> [PDF text] on a separate logging plan, in which the court had exercised control over the Forest Service&#39;s internal affairs.  AP has <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008032560_apwsttimberruling1stldwritethru.html">more</a>. The <em>Oregonian</em> has <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/121514735090910.xml&coll=7&thispage=1">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In late June, the same panel <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/1A2A49E9939948C788257472008188F7/$file/0735804.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [PDF text, AP <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/368468_logging26.html">report</a>] that the NFS generally has the prerogative to determine which trees are candidates for clearing after after a forest fire, but directed the agency to more thoroughly consider whether any logging should be done in certain wilderness areas. In May, the court <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/library/legal_docs/sierra-9th-cir-decision-051408.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-forest.php">report</a>] a lower court order denying an injunction against a NFS plan to allow commercial logging in another forest to help pay for a wildfire prevention program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> [official website] Monday hosted a discussion with genetic scientists, advocates and direct-to-consumer (DTC) genome mapping companies <a href="http://www.navigenics.com/">Navigenics</a>, <a href="http://www.decode.com/">DeCode Genetics</a>, and <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a> [corporate websites] to discuss regulatory concerns.  DTC genetic testing allows members of the public to obtain genetic data about themselves, usually to look for potential health risks, but does not require consultation with a health care professional.  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/">Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> [official website] Director Muin Khoury said that the industry lacks effective regulation and worried that DTC genetic testing does not offer the insights into a person&#39;s health that customers may believe it does. Questions still surround the accuracy and usefulness of DTC testing, and some states want to impose legal limits on the industry. Last month, California <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/files/madrigal.PDF">warned DTC companies that they faced legal action</a> [letter PDF; Genomeweb <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/issues/news/147665-1.html">report</a>] if they failed to comply with state laws requiring physician supervision of the process. New York has also issued similar warnings.  Genomeweb has <a href="http://www.genomeweb.com/issues/news/148033-1.html">more</a>.  <br /><br />In May, US President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/05/20080521-7.html">signed into law</a> [remarks transcript] a bill aimed at preventing employers and health insurers from discriminating against people who have a genetic predisposition to disease.  The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR493:">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008</a> (GINA) [HR 493 materials] had passed with overwhelming majorities in both the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-house-passes-legislation-to-bar.php">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-senate-passes-legislation-to-bar.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports]. Under the measure, employers are barred from basing hiring and firing decisions on genetic risk or predisposition to disease, while health insurers would not be permitted to deny coverage based on genetic information.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Genocide suspects held at the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] will now be able to receive conjugal visits, court officials said Saturday. Court spokesman Roland Amoussouga said that the new policy would bring the court&#39;s practices more in line with those of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], which has allowed conjugal visits since 1993, and with the <a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text].  Detainees must abide by the court&#39;s <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/basicdocs/rulesdet.htm">rules of detention</a> [text] for the visits, and failure to do so would lead to the <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200807070553.html">revocation of the privilege</a> [Hirondelle News Agency report]. Rwandan officials criticized the new policy, calling it a <a href="http://dailynews.habarileo.co.tz/home/index.php?id=5738">&quot;mockery&quot; of the justice system</a> [<em>Daily News</em> report] and saying that it is an <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=13581&article=7618">&quot;excessive&quot; privilege</a> [<em>New Times</em> report] to grant to those suspected of war crimes. The African Press Agency has <a href="http://www.netnewspublisher.com/un-tribunal-allows-rwandan-detainees-conjugal-rights/">more</a>.<br /><br />In early June, the ICTR prosecutor asked the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-seeks-more.php">extend the court&#39;s mandate</a> [JURIST report] so that it could complete all war crimes trials.  <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/factsheets/Jallow.htm">Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [official profile] said in a <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/completionstrat/080501.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] that the recent arrests of several Rwandan genocide suspects meant that the court would not have time to finish several first-instance cases until 2009.  Pursuant to UN <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">Security Council Resolution 1503 (2003)</a> [PDF text], the court is to complete all trials by the end of the year, and to complete all of its work, including appellate review, by 2010.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush called on Congress Tuesday to reject <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080708-7.html">amendments</a> [WH fact sheet] to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">news archive</a>] that would deny telecom companies retroactive immunity for participating in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].  In a <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/DNI-AG-Ltr-07-07-08.pdf">letter</a> [PDF text] sent to Senate Majority leader Harry Reid on Monday, Director of National Intelligence Jack McConnell and Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that they would recommend that Bush veto the legislation if it included the <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/06/bingaman-amendment">Bingaman amendment</a> [EFF backgrounder]:<blockquote>Any amendment that would delay implementation of the liability protections in this manner is unacceptable.  Providing prompt liability protection is critical to the national security.  <u>Accordingly, we, as well as the President&#39;s other senior advisors, will recommend that the President veto any bill that includes such an amendment.</u>[sic]</blockquote>The Bingaman amendment would suspend telecom immunity pending a decision by the Inspector General on the legality of the warrentless wiretapping program.  Two other proposals, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/33906leg20080204.html">Dodd-Feingold-Leahy amendment and the Specter amendment</a> [ACLU backgrounder], would also limit telecom immunity.  EEF has <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/07/court-rules-fisa-preempts-state-secret-">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the US House of Representatives <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml">passed</a> [roll call] a <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6304">compromise version of a bill</a> [HR 6304 materials] amending FISA and including a controversial provision granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].  The bill also grants the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/patriot_foia/2003/court_rules.pdf">FISA court</a> [governing provisions] authority to review a wider range of wiretapping orders, would prohibit the executive branch from overriding the court&#39;s authority, and orders the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] and other agencies to issue a report on the country&#39;s use of wiretapping orders. Earlier versions of the bill without the immunity provisions had also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/house-passes-fisa-amendment-bill.php">passed in the House</a>, but President Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/bush-says-no-compromise-possible-on.php">has promised to veto</a> [JURIST reports] any version of the bill without the language.  The Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week and has already <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-senate-passes-surveillance-bill-with.php">approved similar legislation including the immunity clause</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/074131.P.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF text] that the government can require convicts to receive injections of anti-psychotic medication as a condition of their supervised release. Philip Holman repeatedly failed to abide by a condition of his supervised release that required him to take oral anti-psychotic drugs.  A federal court in Virginia ordered that Holman should instead receive injections, but Holman claimed that the injections violated his due process rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentv">Fifth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text], arguing they were not medically necessary and that less intrusive alternatives existed.  The Fourth Circuit held:<blockquote>The evidence establishing Holman&#8217;s dangerousness also establishes that the district court&#8217;s order was narrowly tailored to the circumstances of this case. As the district court noted, Holman became a danger to himself and others when he was off his medication, and injections of long-lasting antipsychotic drugs provide the only means of insuring that Holman takes his medication. The special condition of supervised release thus significantly furthers and is clearly necessary to further the government&#8217;s interests in protecting Holman and the public.</blockquote>Holman did not dispute that the government could require him to take the oral form of the drug.<br /><br />Last month, lawyers for death-row inmate Richard Taylor <a href="http://blog.aclu.org/2008/06/08/richard-taylors-extraordinary-life-sentence/">arranged a plea agreement</a> [attorney blog post] to prevent their client from being executed, arguing that Taylor <a href="http://www.aclu.org/capital/mentalillness/35508prs20080603.html">was tried despite extreme mental illness</a> [ACLU press release] and that his murder of a prison guard occurred as a result of authorities&#39; refusal to administer anti-psychotic medication.  In 2003, the US Supreme Court ruled on <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/02pdf/02-5664.pdf">Sell v. United States</a> [PDF], finding that anti-psychotic medications can be administered to make a defendant competent to stand trial.  The Court held that an order to involuntarily medicate an individual may be necessary if &quot;any alternative, less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] EU justice ministers agreed to a draft immigration and asylum proposal Tuesday during an informal meeting held ahead of the official Wednesday summit in Cannes, France.  The draft policy is aimed at standardizing EU nations&#39; approach to immigration and asylum, as set out in the <a href="http://www.ue2008.fr/webdav/site/PFUE/shared/ProgrammePFUE/Programme_EN.pdf">work programme</a> [PDF text] circulated by the <a href="http://www.ue2008.fr/PFUE/lang/en/accueil">French EU Presidency</a> [official website] late last month. The programme includes streamlining legal procedures, stepping up efforts against illegal immigration, and promoting a closer partnership between migrants&#39; countries of origin, transit countries, and countries of destination.  The draft policy also seeks to strengthen EU border controls, improve the European asylum system, and provide for the removal of foreigners who remain in the EU illegally.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVe9RiWg-zxQoALQ2sd1w_4s6LswD91P7M380">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7493902.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, EU government leaders meeting in Brussels directed member states to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-union-leaders-call-for-tougher.php">draft tougher border security legislation</a> [JURIST report] to curb the increasing problem of illegal immigration. Also in June, the European Parliament approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-parliament-adopts-new-eu.php">new set of immigration rules</a> [JURIST report] to help combat the increasing number of illegal immigrants in the EU. The rules allow EU states to detain illegal immigrants for up to 18 months to decrease flight risk while deportation is being processed, in addition to imposing a re-entry ban of up to five years on expelled immigrants who do not cooperate or are deemed a security threat. The plan also requires that immigrants be given access to free legal advice, and that minors and families with children only be detained as a last resort.

In June, Thai Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama signed the Thai-Cambodian Joint Communique, indicating Thai support for the Cambodian bid to have the 900-year-old <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/asia/thailand/730106/%27Preah-Vihear-has-the-most-breathtaking-location%27.html">Preah Vihear temple</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> backgrounder] designated a World Heritage site. The court found that section 190 of the Thai <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/download/Constitution2007byIFES.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF text] forbade such a move without parliamentary approval: <blockquote>A treaty that provides for a change in the Thai territories, the extraterritorial areas in which the Kingdom has a sovereign right, or any jurisdictional area the Kingdom has acquired through treaty or through international law, or requires the enactment of an Act for its implementation, or has extensive impacts on the country&#39;s economic and social stability, or has significant bindings on trade, investment, or national budget, must be approved by the National Assembly.</blockquote>On Monday, the <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29008&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html">United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) [official website] <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/fr/actualites/451">approved the Cambodian bid</a> [press release, in French]. After Tuesday&#39;s ruling, opposition party members said they would petition for the removal of Noppadon and eventually the entire cabinet. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSBKK15784420080708?sp=true">more</a>. <br /><br />Tensions have long existed between Thailand and Cambodia concerning the Preah Vihear temple, as both countries have claimed jurisdiction over the structure.  In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4871.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the temple was officially located in Cambodia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US group co-chaired by former Secretaries of State <a href="http://millercenter.org/policy/commissions/warpowers/biographies">James Baker and Warren Christopher</a> [group&#39;s leadership profiles] released a <a href="http://millercenter.org/dev/ci/system/application/views/_newwebsite/policy/commissions/warpowers/report.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/opinion/08baker.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp">op-ed</a>] Tuesday calling for a new law requiring the president to consult with Congress before going to war. Called the <a href="http://millercenter.org/policy/commissions/warpowers/">National War Powers Commission</a> [official website], the group said the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [LII materials] was intended to serve this purpose, but that it has been ignored and may actually be unconstitutional. They called their proposed replacement for the law the &quot;War Powers Consultation Act of 2009,&quot; and said that it would require the president to engage in &quot;meaningful consultation&quot; with Congress before ordering military operations that are planned to last more than a week. Underlining the importance of congressional input on these decisions, the Commission wrote:<blockquote>When congressional consultation and support are obtained during times of war, our country can most effectively execute a unified response to hostilities. That is particularly important today, with the face of war changing and with non-state actors being one of the greatest threats to national security. The more the President and Congress work together to confront these threats, the more likely it is that the country can avoid political and constitutional controversies and also devise the best strategies for defending against those threats.</blockquote>The group says its proposed law will be more effective than the earlier effort because it excludes questionable&nbsp;provisions&nbsp;and provides specific mechanisms for cooperation between the two branches of government. A separate committee on war powers that is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/index.cfm">Constitution Project</a> [advocacy website] criticized the report and proposed resolution following their release, saying the president would still be granted too much deference. The Constitution Project&#39;s committee release its own <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/pdf/War_Powers_Deciding_To_Use_Force_Abroad.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] on war powers in 2005. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hTGW0nTMOMChE7F3D8Fqoqyzs0jAD91PKKBO0">more</a>.<br /><br />The balance of war powers between the president and Congress has <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13092/">long been a point of contention</a> [CFR backgrounder], with constitutional ambiguity concerning what falls under the president&#39;s purview as &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; and what falls under Congress&#39;s exclusive authority to &quot;declare War.&quot; In May, a group filed a <a href="http://law.newark.rutgers.edu/Complaint%20For%20A%20Declaratory%20%20Judgment.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-peace-groups-file-constitutional.php">report</a>] in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the war in Iraq violates the US Constitution because action was initiated without appropriate Congressional approval.  When the 1973 War Powers Resolution was passed, about 80% of the public thought the president should get permission from Congress before going to war, and a Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/108658/Public-Wants-Congress-Approve-Military-Action-Bombings.aspx">poll</a> [results] released Monday determined that 79% of Americans think so today.

The group said that migrant domestic workers have fewer protections than those in other occupations, and are specifically excluded from the country&#39;s 2005 <a href="http://www.mol.gov.sa/mol_site/labor_law.pdf">Labor Law</a> [statute text].  HRW added that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to abuse because their visas are tied to their employer, and that the workers, mostly Asian women, are subject to much of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/women-facing-worldwide-legalized.php">sexual discrimination in the country</a> [JURIST report]. The group said that not all workers were abused but that too many faced harsh conditions:<blockquote>While many domestic workers enjoy decent work conditions, others endure a range of abuses including non-payment of salaries, forced confinement, food deprivation, excessive workload, and instances of severe psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. Human Rights Watch documented dozens of cases where the combination of these conditions amounted to forced labor, trafficking, or slavery-like conditions.</blockquote>HRW encouraged the government to swiftly enact a proposed annex to the labor law, allow the workers access to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/saudi-arabia-setting-up-new-supreme.php">new labor courts</a> [JURIST report], and allow independent monitoring of the migrant worker system. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iLerLxwJJ5C0FPTniAHBL9dm_jcQD91PIMDO0">more</a>.<br /><br />In July 2006 HRW released a broader <a href="http://hrw.org/campaigns/women/2006/domestic_workers/index.htm">report</a> [HRW materials] on conditions faced by domestic workers around the world, chronicling abuses in El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. In December 2006, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/annan-urges-cooperation-in-ending.php">urged member countries</a> [JURIST report] to sign and ratify the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cmw.htm">Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families</a> [text] to protect domestic and other migrant workers.

In March, Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges stemming from a 2003 land purchase his wife, Pojamarn, made from a government-directed institution despite a ban on officials making business deals with government agencies. &nbsp;The court will determine whether Thaksin abused the authority of his office to influence the deal. The judgment in the trial, which is expected to last about two months, cannot be appealed, and Thaksin could be sentenced to up to 13 years in prison if found guilty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [court website] ruled Monday that sentences imposed on seven aboriginal protesters in March for opposing mining company operations on community land were too severe. In February, Robert Lovelace, a member of the <a href="http://www.aafna.ca/">Ardoch Algonquin First Nation</a> (AAFN) [official website], was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt after he refused to comply with a court order allowing <a href="http://www.frontenacventures.com/">Frontenac Ventures Corporation</a> [corporate website] to prospect for uranium on traditional AAFN lands in Ontario. In March, six members of the <a href="http://www.kitchenuhmaykoosib.com/">Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation</a> (KIFN) [official website] were <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2008/2008canlii11049/2008canlii11049.pdf">sentenced</a> [order, PDF] to six months&#39; imprisonment each for contempt of court after they impeded the access of <a href="http://www.platinex.com/">Platinex Inc.</a> [corporate website], an oil drilling company, to exploration property on traditional First Nations land. Lovelace and the so-called &quot;K6&quot; were released in May after their sentences were reduced to time served. In <em>Frontenac Ventures Corporation v. Ardoch Algonquin First Nation</em>, released Monday, the court <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2008/july/2008ONCA0534.pdf">explained</a> [judgment, PDF] that: <blockquote>[I]mprisonment, far from being a meaningful sanction for the community, had the effect of pitting the community against the justice system. That the court found it necessary to imprison the leaders of the AAFN simply serves to emphasize the gulf between the dominant culture&#8217;s sense of justice and this First Nation&#8217;s sense of justice. ... In summary, the appellants&#8217; character and circumstances, their actual conduct, and the difficult legal context within which it occurred, should have counted as significant mitigation when sentences were imposed on them.</blockquote> The court applied the same reasoning in its decision to release the six protestors in <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2008/july/2008ONCA0533.pdf">Platinex, Inc. v. Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation</a> [judgment, PDF]. Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQM-z4eaaPQp1B9RYj9Ss-7X1kTA">more</a>.<br /><br />The <span style="font-style:italic;">Frontenac</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Platinex</span> cases both involve mineral exploration activities on traditional aboriginal lands falling outside the First Nations&#39; federally-recognized territory. In June 2007, Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/canada-pm-proposes-new-tribunal-to.php">unveiled a series of reforms</a> [JURIST report] designed to address a backlog of claims from aboriginal groups seeking redress for land seized by the Canadian government. In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/canadian-high-court-rules-government.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Canadian governments must consult with the <a href="http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=3">Assembly of First Nations</a> [official website] before developing land claimed by aboriginal groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] More than 3000 members of the People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy rallied outside of the Royal Thai Police Headquarters in Bangkok on Monday, calling for a speedy resolution to the corruption trials of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>]. &nbsp;  According to a <em>Bangkok Post</em> <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/070708_News/07Jul2008_news11.php">report</a>, the <a href="http://nccc.thaigov.net/nccc/eng.php">National Counter Corruption Commission</a> (NCCC) [official website] has also expressed impatience with delays in Thaksin&#39;s trials.  The Commission has said that it may bring charges against him without waiting for <a href="http://www.ago.go.th/">Office of the Attorney General</a> [official website, in Thai] to file additional indictments. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080707/D91OUKHG0.html">more</a>. TNA has <a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=5105">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Despite the delays, Thaksin has already been indicted on several counts of corruption. In June, the Committee recommend that <a href="http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080627/tap-as-gen-thailand-thaksin-7934085.html">two new charges be brought</a> [AP report] against Thaksin, one for using his position to secure a $127 million loan to benefit a company owned by his family, and another for corruption related to the purchase of approximately $43 million worth of rubber trees. In March, Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to separate corruption charges stemming from a 2003 land purchase by his wife Pojamarn from a government-directed institution despite a ban on officials making business deals with government agencies. In February, Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/thailand-ex-pm-returns-to-face.php">returned to Thailand</a> from self-imposed exile to face corruption charges laid against him after he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ousted in a military coup</a> [JURIST reports] in September 2006.

The court subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-orders-release-of-congo-ex-militia.php">ordered Lubanga set free</a> [JURIST report] but agreed to suspend his release for five days, giving the prosecution time to appeal.

Averin also called on the Russian government to release 25 alleged political prisoners, but government officials denied that they held any such prisoners in custody.  Rights groups have also accused Russia of holding political prisoners and have <a href="http://www.theotherrussia.org/2008/05/23/activists-urge-medvedev-to-free-political-prisoners/">petitioned for their release</a> [advocacy report].  Averin said NBP plans to hold a rally on September 14 and called for Russians to protest the detentions.

Police reportedly used force against the students and arrested 21 protesters who disregarded police instructions to disperse. The protesters had accused the government of spending over $2 million on luxury cars for legislators, using funds that the protesters argued should be spent on alleviating poverty and subsidizing rising oil prices.  AFP has <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080707/twl-timor-politics-demo-4bdc673.html">more</a>.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP325196.htm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Monday&#39;s protest comes amid rising tensions in East Timor, prompting comparisons to the run-up to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5045510.stm">2006 clashes between soldiers and police</a> [BBC backgrounder] that killed 21 and displaced thousands.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Sudanese parliament Monday passed a long-anticipated electoral law that is expected to ease the country&#39;s transition to democracy.   The law establishes that 60 percent of parliamentary seats will be chosen by majority voting, while the remaining 40 percent will be filled by a proportional representation of political parties.  Of the proportional representation seats, 25 percent will be reserved for women.  Critics, including the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/nda.htm">National Democratic Alliance</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], argued that the draft law would marginalize some political groups.  AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080707/wl_africa_afp/sudanpoliticsvote_080707140442">more</a>.  The <em>Sudan Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27769">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Under the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.unmis.org/English/documents/cpa-en.pdf">2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> [PDF text; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8306.doc.htm">press release</a>], Sudan is scheduled to hold its first democratic elections by 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in Equatorial Guinea Monday convicted British national <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3916465.stm">Simon Mann</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mann">news archive</a>] for his involvement in an alleged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3597450.stm">2004 coup attempt</a> [BBC backgrounder] against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3516588.stm">President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo</a> [BBC profile]. Mann was sentenced to 34 years in prison, to be served at Blackbeach prison in Malabo. The sentence is longer than the 31 years of imprisonment that Equatoguinean prosecutors had sought. Last month, Mann admitted his involvement in plotting the attempted coup, and expressed remorse for his actions. At his trial, Mann testified that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3597196.stm">Sir Mark Thatcher</a> [BBC profile], the son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was involved in the plot and that Mann was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/alleged-equatorial-guinea-coup-plotter.php">&quot;only a junior member&quot;</a> [JURIST report] in the organization plotting to overthrow Mbasogo.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0712570820080707">more</a>.  BBC has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7493717.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Mann, a former British military officer with the elite <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1552242.stm">Special Air Service</a> [BBC backgrounder], was arrested four years ago after a plane carrying him and approximately 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. Mann was <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/alleged-coup-plotters-sentenced-in.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in 2004 in Zimbabwe for plotting the coup, and was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/zimbabwe-slammed-after-alleged.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] to Equatorial Guinea in secret in February 2007 before his appeal process against extradition in Zimbabwe was complete. His lawyers argued that Mann would face torture and possibly the death penalty if extradited, but the Zimbabwe High Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/zimbabwe-court-oks-brit-extradition-to.php">ruled against his appeal</a> [JURIST report] this past January, finding that there was enough evidence of his involvement to carry out extradition, and that the defense failed to show a sufficient likelihood of torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US government is preventing the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] from paying lawyers defending Guantanamo Bay terrorism suspects on trial before <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+military+commissions">US military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive], ACLU director Anthony Romero said Tuesday. Lawyers for the group&#39;s <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/johnadams.html">John Adams Project</a> [advocacy website] are defending detainees included on the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/">US Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control</a> [official website] list of <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sdn/t11sdn.pdf">sanctioned persons</a> [PDF text], but the project must have special licenses in order to&nbsp;<a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2007/julqtr/pdf/31cfr597.505.pdf">pay for the defense</a>&nbsp;[regulatory text, PDF] of the suspects.  Romero said the department is unnecessarily delaying the granting of the licenses, and that the project already owes the lawyers more than $200,000 in fees. Treasury Department spokesman John Rankin said the department works as quickly as possible to process all license requests. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</span> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/guantanamo/story/598224.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, the ACLU and the <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> [advocacy website] announced plans to raise more than $8 million to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/34779prs20080403.html">provide private defense attorneys</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/law-groups-to-underwrite-defense-of.php">report</a>] for high-profile detainees, claiming the US military had not provided adequate financing to defend the detainees with the military lawyers appointed to them. Among the detainees chosen by the ACLU and Criminal Defense Lawyers is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2811855.stm">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid">news archive</a>], who has claimed under oath that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-admits-planning.php">planned the 9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST report] and is responsible for 29 other terrorist attacks. In February, the US government announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-to-seek-death-penalty-in-six-911.php">seek the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and five other Guantanamo detainees accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials for the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Wednesday that they will revise the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dag/cftf/business_organizations.pdf">Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations</a> [text, PDF] to no longer induce waivers of the attorney-client privilege and to limit what sensitive information investigators may gather. The announcement was part of a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearing.cfm?id=3453">DOJ oversight hearing</a> [materials] by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and was included in a letter from <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dag/">Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip</a> [official profile] to Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Arlen Specter (R-Penn.), who have both opposed the current wide prosecutorial discretion in business organization cases. In response, Leahy <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200807/070908d.html">wrote</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Filip&#8217;s letter appears to be an encouraging development.  The proposed policy would ensure that the Department will evaluate corporate cooperation based on the information provided, rather than whether or not a corporation waived the privilege; limits the types of privileged information that may be requested; and makes clear that the Department cannot consider whether a corporation covered employee legal expenses or sanctioned its employees.</blockquote> The <font style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</font> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/09/AR2008070902167.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dag/dagmcnultybio.htm">former US Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty</a> [official profile] announced that the DOJ would <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/doj-drops-policy-encouraging-turnover.php">no longer encourage corporations to turn over confidential records</a> [JURIST report] to officials investigating corporate fraud. The so-called <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dag/speech/2006/mcnulty_memo.pdf">McNulty Memorandum</a> [text, PDF] revised portions of an older policy, which included the turning over of records as a indicator of a business&#39;s cooperation with prosecutors. In late 2007, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-house-passes-bill-to-protect.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.03013:">Attorney-Client Privilege Act of 2007</a> [HR 3013 materials], which would bar prosecutors from demanding that a corporation waive its attorney-client privilege and from considering that waiver in deciding whether to prosecute.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday ordered a federal court to hold an evidentiary hearing to consider whether a man sentenced to death for murder might be mentally retarded.  After Michael Wayne Hall was convicted of the 1998 killing of a 19-year-old woman, he claimed at state <em>habeas</em> proceedings that he was mentally retarded.  While Hall&#39;s state <em>habeas</em> claim was pending in Texas, the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-8452.ZS.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Atkins v. Virginia</span></a> [text], holding that the execution of mentally retarded individuals is unconstitutional and outlining heightened standards for determining a defendant&#39;s developmental status.  The Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-70041-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that Hall is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to prove his contentions because: <blockquote>[T]he facts before us are a core manifestation of a case where the state fails to provide a full and fair hearing and where such a hearing would bring out facts which, if proven true, support habeas relief...[T]he state court&#39;s erroneous factfinding and its refusal to accept more than paper submissions despite the development of a new constitutional standard and a lack of guidance from the state on that standard deprived Hall of a full and fair hearing at the state level...Given the material errors in credibility determinations and factfinding at the state level, we are persuaded that the determination of Hall&#39;s claim, caught in the immediate uncertainty following <span style="font-style: italic;">Atkins</span>, was so freighted with a risk of error in factfinding that the failure of the district court below to conduct a meaningful hearing was an abuse of discretion in these unusual and unique circumstances.</blockquote> Concurring in part and dissenting in part, Judge Patrick Higginbotham asserted that the district court should enter an order that unless the state provides Hall with a constitutionally adequate evidentiary hearing within 120 days, Hall will no longer be eligible to receive a death sentence.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hUltupqhInIii8YSPEhE2eVyNYiQD91LHOVG0">more</a>.<br /><br />In August 2007, the European Union (EU) urged Texas officials to <a href="http://www.eu2007.pt/UE/vEN/Noticias_Documentos/Declaracoes_PESC/20070821Texas.htm">halt all executions in the state</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/eu-urges-moratorium-on-texas-death.php">report</a>] and to consider introducing a moratorium on death sentences. EU officials specifically praised the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Atkins</span> and asked the state to expand it to those with severe mental illness. Texas has since maintained its death-penalty policy, and other states have <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/tennessee-high-court-allows-execution.php">followed suit</a> [JURIST report]. In 29 states, the defendant <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/new-jersey-high-court-shifts-mental.php">carries the burden</a> [JURIST report] of proving mental retardation in death-penalty cases to receive a lesser sentence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] Wednesday affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/nyc-subway-bomb-plotter-who-wanted-to.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of a Pakistani man tried for conspiring to bomb a New York City subway station.  On appeal, Shahawar Matin Siraj (Matin) argued that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a> [text] required police to produce reports memorializing oral statements that he made to an undercover police officer.  The court <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA3LTAyMjQtY3Jfb3BuLnBkZg==/07-0224-cr_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irlf8f5/6/hilite">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] Matin&#39;s argument, concluding that <blockquote>[B]y explicitly designating as discoverable only those written memorializations of oral statements made in response to interrogation by a known government agent...Rule 16 implicitly excludes from its scope written memorializations of other oral statements such as those at issue here.</blockquote>Matin will be deported after he serves his 30-year <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/federal-judge-sentences-nyc-subway.php">sentence</a> [JURIST report] in the US.<br /><br />A federal jury <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2006may24.htm">convicted</a> [US DOJ press release] Matin despite his claim that he was entrapped. He said that an undercover officer suggested the bomb plot and incited him with photographs of US prisoner abuse at <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive]. The prosecution <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12609443">presented videotape surveillance</a> [MSNBC report] of Matin in which he stated he would not plant the explosive device. Siraj first drew authorities&#39; attention for expressing anti-American sentiments after <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive]. No evidence was presented linking him to any terrorist groups or showing that he ever actually gathered explosive materials.

Mbarushimana, a Hutu, was an employee of the <a href="http://www.undp.org/">UN Development Programme</a> (UNDP) [official website] in Rwanda during the the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder], and was arrested in Frankfurt after Interpol issued an <a href="http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/2004/74/2004_52874.asp">alert</a> [Interpol notice]. He is suspected by Rwandan authorities of being responsible for the deaths of a number of Tutsis during the genocide, including some fellow UNDP employees.

Carla Del Ponte, the former chief prosecutor for the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> [official website], refused to charge him and said the ICTR did not file an indictment against Mbarushimana because it lacked sufficient evidence against him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]   <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics</a> (CREW) [advocacy website] Monday <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/32420">filed bar complaints</a> [press release] against two former US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] officials, alleging that <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Elston%20Complaint.pdf">Michael J. Elston</a> and <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/McDonald%20Complaint.pdf">Esther Slater McDonald</a> [bar complaints, PDF] improperly considered applicants&#39; political affiliations when reviewing applications for DOJ jobs and summer internships.  Both McDonald and Elston were named in a June <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0806/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">report</a>] released by the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website], which found that the DOJ had granted preferential treatment to conservative candidates under 2002 and 2006 screening programs.<br /><br />The June report found that political officials played a significant role in the department&#39;s hiring processes, supporting accusations that the Bush administration has politicized the supposedly nonpartisan department. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/gonzales-resigns-as-us-attorney-general.php">resigned</a>  [JURIST report] last year amidst related allegations concerning the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">alleged firing of US Attorneys for political reasons</a> [JURIST news archive].  On Monday, former DOJ intern Sean Gerlich announced he was seeking class action status for a suit against the DOJ for <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2008/07/01/GerlichvDOJ.pdf">discrimination based on political affiliation</a> [PDF complaint; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-intern-sues-doj-for-partisan.php">report</a>]. In the suit, Gerlich alleges that he was denied a position in the department&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oarm/arm/hp/hp.htm">Honors Program</a> [DOJ materials] because of his earlier work with a human rights group and a democratic campaign.  The <a href="http://www.osc.gov/">Office of Special Counsel</a> [official website] has also announced that it will be conducting an investigation into whether or not disciplinary measures are warranted for employees involved in the illegal screening of applicants.  <em>Legal Times</em> has <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202422843431">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two Swiss nationalist parties gathered enough signatures on their <a href="http://www.minarets.ch/">initiative against the construction of minarets</a> [initiative website, in French] to <a href="http://www.edi.admin.ch/aktuell/00705/00724/index.html?lang=en&msg-id=20064">force a national referendum</a> [Federal Council press release] on whether the country&#39;s constitution should be amended to ban the structures, the Swiss government announced Tuesday. Officials for the right-wing <a href="http://www.svp.ch/">Swiss People&#39;s Party</a> (UDC) and the <a href="http://www.edu-schweiz.ch/cms/">Federal Democratic Union</a> (UDF) [party websites, in German] introduced the initiative in May 2007 in an effort to amend Article 72 of the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/org/polit/00083/index.html?lang=en&download=M3wBPgDB_8ull6Du36WenojQ1NTTjaXZnqWfVp3Uhmfhnapmmc7Zi6rZnqCkkIN0f32CbKbXrZ6lhuDZz8mMps2gpKfo">Federal Constitution</a> [text, PDF] to include that &quot;[t]he construction of minarets is prohibited.&quot; Supporters have said that the Islamic towers are not inherently religious and would not prevent the free exercise of religion, meaning that they are not protected for religious reasons under the constitution. They also have said that the towers are more accurately symbols of religious and political power and suggest a stronger deference to Islam than to the Swiss political and legal systems. More than 114,000 people signed the initiative, but the Federal Council said that it will continue to advise against adopting the initiative. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/08/islam.race?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront">more</a>.<br /><br />In June the UDC supported another <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d//pore/vi/vis320t.html">referendum</a> [question text, in German] that would have given municipalities control over the granting of Swiss passports without providing an appeal process for applicants. Voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/switzerland-voters-reject-citizenship.php">rejected the initiative</a> [JURIST report], but the UDC had urged the referendum to reduce the influence of outside cultures on Switzerland and ensure better-integrated immigrants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand&#39;s opposition Democrat party Wednesday announced it would launch an impeachment bid against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] after a series of court decisions against key officials in the government and Samak&#39;s People Power Party (PPP).  On Wednesday, the Thai <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Thai] dismissed Thai Public Health Minister Chaiya Sasomsup from office after finding he had violated finance laws by not declaring certain assets held by his wife.  On Tuesday, the court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-support-for-cambodia-heritage.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a June cabinet communique signed by Thai Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama in support of a World Heritage site on Thailand&#39;s border with Cambodia was <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/download/news12_2551.pdf">unconstitutional</a> [PDF press release, in Thai]. Opposition parties have since announced plans to seek Noppadon&#39;s impeachment.  Also Tuesday, the Thai Supreme Court found ranking PPP official Yongyuth Tiyapairat guilty of voter fraud related to last December&#39;s election.  Experts say that the ruling could clear the way for further legal actions against the PPP, including a possible bid for the party&#39;s dissolution.  AFP has <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/359262/1/.html">more</a>.  TNA has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/previousdetail.php?id=128795">additional coverage</a>. The <em>Bangkok Post</em> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/previousdetail.php?id=128784">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The PPP has been closely associated with former Thailand prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], now on trial for corruption.  Protesters have demanded Samak&#39;s resignation, accusing him of being a puppet for Thaksin.  On Monday, members of the People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-protesters-accuse-authorities.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] delays in various corruption trials Thaksin is facing, and the <a href="http://nccc.thaigov.net/nccc/eng.php">National Counter Corruption Commission</a> (NCCC) [official website] said that it may bring more charges against Thaksin without waiting for <a href="http://www.ago.go.th/">Office of the Attorney General</a> [official website, in Thai] to file additional indictments.   In March, Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges stemming from a 2003 land purchase his wife, Pojamarn, made from a government-directed institution despite a ban on officials making business deals with government agencies.  The court will determine whether Thaksin abused the authority of his office to influence the deal. The judgment in the trial, which is expected to last about two months, cannot be appealed, and Thaksin could be sentenced to up to 13 years in prison if found guilty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former Chinese <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/171281.htm">anti-corruption</a> [Xinhua backgrounder] prosecutor was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday for torturing to death a government official in May 2007. Xiong Zhengliang was convicted of killing Liang Jiping, a deputy director of a government electricity utility, while Liang was in custody for allegedly accepting bribes.&nbsp;Xiong and two deputies <a href="http://www.thebeijingnews.com/news/guonei/2008/07-09/018@085354.htm">beat and deprived Liang of sleep</a> [<em>The Beijing News</em> report, in Chinese] in order to obtain a confession, eventually resulting in Liang&#39;s death. The two deputies received prison sentences of 10 and 15 years respectively for their involvement in the killing, and Xiong&#39;s supervisor received a seven-year sentence for attempting to cover up the incident. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSPEK68096">more</a>.<br /><br />China has taken a hard line on corruption in recent years, punishing several officials with lengthy prison terms or <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/china-ex-prosecutor-gets-suspended.php">executions</a> [JURIST report]. In January, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/china-issues-anti-corruption-rules-for.php">issued new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] for public officials.  In December 2007, a former prosecutor received a <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/china-ex-prosecutor-gets-suspended.php">suspended death sentence</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted of accepting bribes and embezzling money. In September 2007, a former official of the Agricultural Bank of China was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/china-executes-bank-official-for-taking.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] for taking bribes and embezzling nearly $2 million.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate Wednesday voted <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00168">69-28</a>  [roll call] to approve a bill amending the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">news archive</a>] to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies participating in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].   Earlier in the day, the Senate had rejected three proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080708-7.html">amendments</a> [WH fact sheet] to the bill that would have limited immunity.  The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SP05064:">Dodd-Feingold-Leahy amendment</a> [S.Amndt 5064; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/33906leg20080204.html">backgrounder</a>], which would have removed all mention of telecom immunity from the legislation, was rejected <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00164">32-66</a> [roll call].  The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SP5066:">Bingaman amendment</a> [S.Amndt 5066; EFF <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/06/bingaman-amendment">backgrounder</a>], which would have suspended immunity pending a decision by the Inspector General on the legality of the warrantless wiretapping program, was rejected by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00166">56-42</a> [roll call].  The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SP5059:">Specter amendment</a> [S.Amndt 5059; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/33906leg20080204.html">backgrounder</a>], which would have limited immunity to instances where a court found that the associated intelligence operation was constitutional, was rejected <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00165">61-37</a> [roll call].  On Tuesday, President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-calls-on-congress-to-reject-fisa.php">called on Congress</a> [JURIST report] to pass legislation granting telecom companies retroactive immunity, promising to veto any bill that did not include such provisions.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080709/D91QGQHO0.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the US House of Representatives <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml">passed</a> [roll call] a <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6304">compromise version of a bill</a> [HR 6304 materials] amending FISA and including a controversial provision granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that participated in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].  The bill also grants the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/patriot_foia/2003/court_rules.pdf">FISA court</a> [governing provisions] authority to review a wider range of wiretapping orders, would prohibit the executive branch from overriding the court&#39;s authority, and orders the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] and other agencies to issue a report on the country&#39;s use of wiretapping orders. Earlier versions of the bill without the immunity provisions had also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/house-passes-fisa-amendment-bill.php">passed in the House</a>, but President Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/bush-says-no-compromise-possible-on.php">has said he will veto</a> [JURIST reports] any version of the bill without the language.  The Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week and has already <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-senate-passes-surveillance-bill-with.php">approved similar legislation including the immunity clause</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli rights group <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en&id=">Yesh Din</a> [advocacy website] published an <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/sys/images/File/LESVDataSheetJuly2008Eng%5B1%5D.pdf">update</a> [data sheet, PDF] Tuesday to its <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/report/ASemblanceofLaw-Eng.pdf">2006 report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/report/ASemblanceofLaw-EngSum.pdf">summary</a>, PDF] detailing the lack of investigations and prosecutions of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=israeli+settlers">Israeli settlers</a> who commit crimes against <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=palestinians">Palestinians</a> [JURIST news archives]. According to the report, Israeli police have issued indictments in less than 10 percent of complaints filed by Palestinians monitored by the group, and most of the complaints filed were for assault or criminal trespass.  The group said the way police investigate these claims has not changed since the 2006 report was released:<blockquote>[V]ictims&#39; complaints and testimonies were recorded in Hebrew rather than Arabic, the language in which they were given; the police investigators rarely visited the crime scenes, and in the cases when they did arrive on site, defects were noted in documenting the events; in many cases testimony was not collected from key witnesses, including suspects and both Palestinian and Israeli eyewitnesses of the incident; live identification lineups of Israeli civilian suspects were hardly ever carried out; confrontations between victims and suspects were also rarely staged; in none of the investigation files checked by Yesh Din, in which the suspects offered claims of an alibi, were their claims verified before the case was closed; the contents of about one third of the investigation files were very sparse, and indicated a hasty closure of the case shortly after the complaint was received; in a number of cases a decision was made to close the investigation, even though the material accumulated in the case file indicated sufficient prima facie evidence to prosecute the suspects; and an examination of cases closed on grounds of &quot;no criminal culpability&quot; raised questions about the decision to close cases on those grounds, given that the closure was executed on the basis of insufficient investigations.</blockquote> A lawyer for the organization said the report shows that Israel is failing to control its citizens, but spokesmen for the police and a pro-settler group said that the report misrepresents data and draws erroneous conclusions. Haaretz has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1000210.html">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Jerusalem Post</span> has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215330904443&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] released a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=3203">statement</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">report</a>] criticizing recently announced Israeli plans to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">create new settlements in the West Bank</a> [Haaretz report]. In December 2007 Yesh Din <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/israel-soldiers-rarely-charged-for.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Israeli government for failing to investigate Palestinian killings allegedly committed by members of the <a href="http://www.idf.il/">Israel Defense Force</a> [official website]. Israeli military officials later said that there was a <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/israel-military-says-investigations-of.php">36 percent increase</a> [JURIST report] of such investigations in 2007.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attorney General Michael Mukasey denied Wednesday that proposed <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] guidelines would allow agents to open terror investigations based solely on a person&#39;s race, religion, or ethnicity.  Testifying at a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearing.cfm?id=3453">meeting</a> [notice of hearing] of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website], Mukasey said that travel to foreign terror &quot;hot spots&quot; would be one of many factors to be considered but refused to discuss hypothetical situations that might lead to an investigation.  In a <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=3453&wit_id=7281">prepared statement</a> [text], Mukasey focused on DOJ efforts to ensure a smooth transfer of power in the upcoming presidential election and called on Congress to pass an amended <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">news archive</a>], saying that it was vital for national security:<blockquote>It is also important that we do everything we can to give our national security professionals, who will be confronting the al Qaeda threat in this Administration and the next, the tools they need to keep us safe. Nothing is more important in that regard than the effort to reform and update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The ability to intercept and to analyze the electronic communications of our country&#8217;s enemies is the best defensive weapon we have, and I appreciate all the efforts of the members of this Committee and your colleagues in the Senate in this regard.</blockquote>  Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/member_statement.cfm?id=3453&wit_id=2629">said</a> [statement] that Mukasey&#39;s testimony would be a chance to address concerns that the DOJ had become politicized under the Bush administration:<blockquote>The recent report from the Department&#39;s Inspector General confirms what our oversight efforts have uncovered about the politicizing of hiring practices at the Department. It confirms our findings and our fears that the same Bush Justice Department officials involved with the firing of United States Attorneys were injecting partisanship into the hiring of young attorneys. I expect further reports from the Inspector General will shed additional light on the extent to which the Bush administration has allowed politics to affect &#8211; and infect &#8211; the Department&#39;s priorities, from law enforcement to the operation of the Civil Rights Division to the Department&#39;s hiring practices.<br /><br />The Department of Justice is not the President&#8217;s legal defense team any more than the Attorney General is his lawyer. The Attorney General is not the White House counsel and should not act as one. The Department of Justice is a law enforcement agency, not a partisan political operation. These are the truths that have been overridden in the last seven years.</blockquote> In response to questioning by committee members over the alleged politicization of the DOJ, Mukasey said that the department was instituting the reforms <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">recommended by the Inspector General</a> [JURIST report] in a June report.  AP has <a href="http://www.lawinfo.com/legal-news-story.html?msgID=FEDA3E53-67C0-46D9-8E37-E70D3CAC1327">more</a>.<br /><br />Under the proposed FBI guidelines as explained to AP by unnamed sources last week, agents would be able to initiate investigations even in instances where there is no evidence of a crime, something required under current guidelines.  Last Thursday, the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] decried the plan as <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=25092&&name=n&&currPage=1&&Active=1">&quot;unconstitutional and unAmerican&quot;</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/fbi-terrorism-profiling-proposal-un.php">report</a>], saying that it could allow security agents to target Muslims and Arab-Americans for harassment. A US Department of Justice spokesman responding to press reports on the plan - which had neither been finalized nor formally announced - denied that the new guidelines would allow profiling, noting that ethnicity is only one of many factors to be considered and that it is only when all those factors as a whole are deemed suspicious that an investigation can be opened.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The chief judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [court website] said Tuesday that the US government should make detention appeals by Guantanamo detainees a top priority, and devote all necessary resources to ensuring that the appeals reach trial in a timely manner.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/hogan-bio.html">Judge Thomas F. Hogan</a>&nbsp;[official profile] made the comments&nbsp;at the first hearing concerning coordination issues for the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habeas+corpus"><font style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</font></a> [JURIST news archive] appeals of several terrorism detainees now being held at <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hogan will be establishing deadlines for the government to turn over evidence on the&nbsp;detainees&nbsp;to their lawyers, and told the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to put other cases on hold while complying with these requests.&nbsp;AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gUxng-zkl2uhqdCATFQyY9_8QV3QD91PUIK80">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges at the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [court website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/95/Decision_on_Ieng_thirith_appeal_C20_I_27_EN.pdf">denied the bail request</a> [decision text, PDF] of former Khmer Rouge minister for social affairs <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ieng+thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [JURIST news archive], finding that she could be criminally culpable for her actions and that she is still dangerous to society. The ECCC ordered Ieng Thirith into <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/11/Provisional_detention_order_IENG_Thirith_ENG.pdf">provisional detention</a> [order, PDF] in November 2007 on charges of crimes against humanity on the basis that the detention was necessary to ensure a timely and fair trial. Her lawyers <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/28/Appeal_Ieng_thirith_C20_I_3_EN_revised.pdf">appealed</a> [text, PDF], arguing that the court&#39;s <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/fileUpload/27/Internal_Rules_Revision1_01-02-08_eng.pdf">Internal Rules</a> [Rule 63(3) text, PDF] did not warrant detention. The appellate division upheld the order, saying: <blockquote>There are well-founded reasons to believe that the Charged Person was, in her capacity as Minister of Social Affairs, in a position to prevent the enslavement and other inhumane acts to which the civilian population was allegedly subjected and that she failed to do so. The Charged Person might therefore be responsible for these alleged crimes of enslavement and other inhumane acts which, in the context of a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population, can be characterized as crimes against humanity.</blockquote> The appellate division also held that Ieng Thirith&#39;s past conduct indicated a risk that she could pressure witnesses and victims, destroy evidence, and flee the country. The decision also found that her release would disturb public order, making her continued detention necessary. If convicted of the charges against her, Ieng Thirith faces a sentence of five years to life in prison. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdrjQo_Pv-W1uYB0uWZ3f-o1d2SA">more</a>.<br /><br />The ECCC was established by <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/law/4/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf">law</a> [text as amended 2004, PDF] in 2001 to investigate and try surviving Khmer Rouge officials. The Khmer Rouge is generally believed to be responsible for the genocide of an <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] between 1975 and 1979. No top Khmer Rouge officials have yet faced trial. In August 2007, the ECCC brought its first charges against <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Khek Iev</a> [TrialWatch profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/indicted-ex-khmer-rouge-leader-willing.php">report</a>], who was in charge of the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh. Former Khmer Rouge official <a href="http://www.genocidewatch.org/CambodiaLatestInterviewWithNuonCheaBrotherNumber2OfTheKillingField16Feb2007.htm">Nuon Chea</a> [GenocideWatch report] is <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/khmer-rouge-second-in-command-selects.php">awaiting trial</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/indictment/2/Provisional_Detention_Order_Nuon_Chea_19092007_ENG.pdf">charges</a> [statement, PDF] of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Charges have also been brought against former Khmer Rouge head of state Khieu Samphan, who was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/eccc-arrests-ex-khmer-rouge-head-of.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November 2007, and against former Foreign Minister and Ieng Thirith&#39;s husband, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ieng+sary">Ieng Sary</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A UK intelligence official said Tuesday that there are &quot;very strong indications&quot; that the Russian government was behind the murder of former KGB agent and British citizen <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6179074.stm">timeline</a>].  The official made the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7494585.stm">comments</a> [BBC video clip] anonymously during a television interview with the BBC, and asserted that the type of poison used proves Russia&#39;s involvement in the plot.  The UK has a strained relationship with Russia, due partly to Russia&#39;s refusal to extradite <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lugovoi+OR+lugovoy">Andrei Lugovoy</a> [JURIST news archive], the man suspected of actually administering the poison, so that he could <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/britain-charging-russian-in-probe-of.php">stand trial for murder</a> [JURIST report] in the UK.  Russian officials say the Russian constitution <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-formally-rejects-uk-extradition.php">prohibits the extradition of citizens for criminal trials in other countries</a> [JURIST report].  While the government has offered to prosecute Lugovoi in Russia, it contends that the UK has <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/russia-says-uk-has-not-turned-over.php">not yet provided any credible evidence</a> [JURIST report] to link Lugovoy to the murder.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7494142.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Litvinenko and Lugovoy, both former employees of the <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/">Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation</a> (FSB) [official website], met in London on November 1, 2006, hours before Litvinenko fell ill to radioactive poisoning.  UK Ambassador to Russia Sir Tony Brenton has <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/putin-rebukes-uk-ambassador-on-russia.php">implied</a> [JURIST report] that the Russian constitution should not prevent Lugovoy&#39;s extradition, alleging that the Russian government routinely ignores its own laws.  Former Russian President <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">news archive</a>] rebuked the comments, characterizing the UK&#39;s demand for the extradition as &quot;a clear remnant of colonial thinking.&quot;  The two countries have battled politically since Litvinenko&#39;s death, with each <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-expels-4-uk-diplomats-as-lugovoy.php">expelling a number of the other country&#39;s diplomats</a> in July 2007 and Russia <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/russia-uk-trade-legal-barbs-over.php">closing down local offices of the British Council</a> in December 2007 [JURIST reports].

Therefore, on a matter of principle, I cannot support the proposal in the Bill for pre-charge detention of 42 days.</blockquote> Manningham-Buller&#39;s speech was part of the opening House of Lords <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80708-0002.htm#08070843000002">debate</a> [transcript; Liberty UK <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2008/peers-to-begin-opposition-to-42-day-pre-charge-detention-plans.shtml">backgrounder</a>] on the bill. The peers will vote on the bill in the fall, and are expected to reject it. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Independent</span> has <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/former-head-of-mi5-says-42day-detention-plan-is-unworkable-862947.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Currently, British law authorizes <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-uk-government-loses.php">detention of terrorism suspects without charge for 28 days</a> [JURIST report]. Proponents of the new bill have argued that the 28-day time limit endangers national security. <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12037.asp">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4045210.ece">argued for the necessity of the bill</a> [<em>Times</em> column] and told MPs that it is the <a href="http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm/cmtoday/cmdebate/02.htm#hddr_3">government&#39;s duty</a> [PMQ transcript] to provide such security. In June, the House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-commons-approves-42-day-terrorism.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report], but the House of Lords must still approve it for it to become law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg1/greco/default_en.asp">Group of States against Corruption</a> (GRECO) [official website] expressed &quot;great concern&quot; Tuesday over Italy&#39;s decision to dissolve the office of <a href="http://www.anticorruzione.it/site/home/1/home.aspx">High Commissioner against corruption</a> [official website], effective August 25, 2008.  In a <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg1/greco/news/News(20080708)EliminationOfficeHighComm.Letter%20Drago%20KOS_en.pdf">letter</a> [PDF] to High Commissioner Vincenzo Grimaldi, the president of GRECO, a coalition of European states dedicated to monitoring compliance with the Council of Europe&#39;s anti-corruption standards, wrote:<blockquote>I really fear that Italy is about to move back to a situation in which there is no real political will to fight corruption...the elimination of your Office is not only a loss for your country but also for GRECO.  It would appear that your government does not understand that Italy, as a founding member of the Council of Europe, is watched closely by those member States which have more recently joined the organisation.  This bad example may well impact on the position of anti-corruption bodies in other GRECO member States, some of which have come under pressure lately.</blockquote>The office of High Commissioner, established on October 24, 2004, was charged with identifying and investigating possible cases of corruption within the Italian government.  The move to eliminate the office is part of a national reorganization plan meant to consolidate a number of small public administrative offices.  Last week <a href="http://www.transparency.org">Transparency International</a> [official website], a global anti-corruption advocacy group, expressed <a href="http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases_nc/2008/italy_high_commissioner_against_corruption_03_july_2008">similar concerns</a> [press release] over the decision.<br /><br />GRECO&#39;s statements came on the same day as an estimated <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/08/europe/EU-Italy-Protest.php">10,000 people assembled in Rome</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">International Herald Tribune</span> report] to protest proposed legislation that would protect high-ranking government officials from prosecution during their terms in office. Italian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] faces <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/italy-corruption-trial-of-ex-pm.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] dating back to 1997, causing critics to speculate that Burlusconi&#39;s support for the measures is personally motivated, since his trial is likely to be affected. The proposed bill, along with a <a href="http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00302147.pdf">resolution</a> [PDF, in Italian; <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/31433.htm">legislative materials</a>, in Italian] passed by the Italian Senate that would <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-senate-approves-legislation.php">suspend older trials for nonviolent crimes</a> [JURIST report], could suspend the proceedings indefinitely.

The two signatories <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2008/April/20080403111421eaifas0.1671259.html">worked out most of the details</a> [joint statement] of the agreement in April, but it has yet to be approved by the Czech parliament. An estimated two-thirds of Czechs oppose the pact and over 1000 protesters demonstrated Monday against its signing in Prague. The US is <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igM4W3LbJq_Q4GjTciMlVjYEA6ZQ">seeking a similar agreement with Poland</a> [AFP report], but that agreement has been delayed by disagreements over what other military aid might be involved.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The upper house of the Dutch parliament voted 50-15 Tuesday to approve the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], formally known as the <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [official website; PDF <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf">text</a>].  Last month, <a href="http://www.minister-raad.info/english/prime_minister/pm/index.html">Netherlands Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende</a> [official profile] said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/netherlands-pressing-on-with.php">press on with ratification</a>, even after <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">Irish voters rejected the treaty</a> [JURIST reports] in a referendum earlier that month.  The Dutch parliament&#39;s lower house <a href="http://www.europeanvoice.com/Article/61093.aspx">approved</a> [European Voice report] the treaty by a vote of 111-39 in June.  Xinhua has <a href="http://rss.xinhuanet.com/newsc/english/2008-07/08/content_8513231.htm">more</a>.  <em>Dutch News</em> has <a href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/07/the_netherlands_ratifies_eu_tr.php">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Other EU countries have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-council-to-discuss-lisbon.php">delayed ratifying the treaty</a> [JURIST report] until the full effect of the Irish referendum is known. The future of the pact is currently in doubt as it must be approved by all 27 EU states in order to take effect. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/eu-leaders-sign-reform-treaty.php">signed the reform treaty</a> [JURIST report] last December, and 14 countries have <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lisbon+treaty">ratified the document</a> [JURIST archive] so far.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former UK shadow Home Secretary <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=people.person.page&personID=4881">David Davis</a> [party profile], who <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7450899.stm">resigned</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/top-uk-opposition-mp-resigns-to-protest.php">report</a>] his parliamentary position in protest over an <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/counterterrorism.html">anti-terror bill</a> [materials; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7207659.stm">Q/A</a>] in June, won  a forced by-election Friday with almost 72% of the vote.  In his <a href="http://www.daviddavisforfreedom.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&newsID=63360&from=list">acceptance speech</a> [text], Davis promised to stand for civil liberties and oppose what he termed &quot;draconian&quot; security measures:<blockquote>Today, the people of Haltemprice and Howden have delivered a stunning message to the government ... as our campaign has reverberated across the country.  Four weeks ago as Gordon Brown stooped into the gutter to rig the vote on 42 days, Ministers crowed that 69% of people supported 42 days.  Today just 36% support it.  Four weeks ago, the government touted public support for a range of other draconian measures.  Today, 71% support my stand against the attacks on British liberty.  And in the House of Lords, the last Head of MI5 savaged the government&#39;s 42 day proposal.  It now lies in tatters, robbed of any remaining credibility. Along with this government.  And that&#39;s after just 3 weeks.</blockquote> Davis had resigned after the UK House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-commons-approves-42-day-terrorism.php">passed an anti-terror bill</a> [JURIST report] that would allow authorities to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=42+days+UK">detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days</a> [JURIST news archive].  He said that by resigning and forcing a by-election, in which he ran, he could take the issue to his constituents for public debate.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7501029.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Current British law authorizes <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/breaking-news-uk-government-loses.php">detention without charge for 28 days</a> [JURIST report], but proponents of the 42-day detention limit have argued that the 28-day limitation endangers national security. Critics of the bill, including Davis, say that it would be an unacceptable abridgment of basic rights.  UK Home Secretary Jacqui Smith first <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-government-proposes-42-day-detention.php">proposed a 42-day detention period</a> [JURIST report] in December 2007. The proposal followed statements made in June 2007 by then-UK Home Secretary John Reid <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/uk-home-secretary-floats-toughened-anti.php">calling for longer pre-charge time limits</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human rights groups and defense lawyers have criticized the refusal of Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official profile] to interfere with US proceedings against Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] in light of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/KhadrDocuments.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday showing that the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-documents-show-canada-knew-of-khadr.php">knew Khadr had been mistreated</a> [JURIST report]. Harper spoke Friday of the severity of the criminal charges against Khadr, and called the Guantanamo process necessary to discover the truth. Harper also stressed that the US has assured Canada that the treatment of Khadr is humane. <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/">Amnesty International Canada</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said in an <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/amnestynews/upload/Open_Letter_Khadr_July_2008.pdf">open letter</a> [text, PDF] that the treatment revealed by the documents constitutes torture, and that Canadian inaction is indefensible and unjust: <blockquote>It is shocking to learn that as far back as five years ago Canadian officials knew of the torture and ill-treatment Omar Khadr had experienced but did not intervene on his behalf. Instead at that time, much as today, the government had insisted that they had received assurances from US officials that Mr. Khadr was being well-treated, in a manner consistent with the spirit of the Geneva Conventions, and that there was therefore no reason for Canada to intervene. Today&#39;s revelations underscore how unreliable and hollow those assurances were.</blockquote> Lawyers for Khadr have agreed with AI&#39;s calls for Canadian government <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=cdb6cf5c-a9b1-47f5-b74e-01a7c24b88a6">action</a> [Canwest report] on Khadr&#39;s behalf.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] announced that next week it will <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/139/14631.pdf">rule on a Mexican petition</a> [press release, PDF] asking to delay the executions of five Mexicans on death row in the US.  Mexican authorities allege that US officials denied the five men the chance to speak with Mexican counselor officers in violation of the 1963 <a href="http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/consul.htm">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text].  Last month, Mexico asked the ICJ to rule on its request for provisional measures and to clarify a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imus/imusframe.htm">2004 ruling</a> [ruling and case materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004_03_31_indexarch.htm#108073611218442417">report</a>] holding that such executions violated international law. The group of Mexicans includes <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights/2005/05/insights050531.html">Jose Ernesto Medellin</a> [ASIL backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medellin">news archive</a>], who is scheduled to be executed August 5. In May, a Texas court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/texas-judge-sets-execution-date-for.php">set  Medellin&#39;s execution date</a> [JURIST report] after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchas%20/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in March that President George W. Bush did not have the authority to direct state courts to comply with the ICJ&#39;s order for new court hearings.  Reuters has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080711/ts_nm/mexico_usa_icj_dc">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2005, the Mexican Congress <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/mexican-congress-votes-to-remove-death.php">voted to remove the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] from the Mexican constitution.  While Mexico had not carried out a death sentence in the previous 43 years and regularly refused to hand over suspects to the US who faced a potential death sentence, the practice was still legal in military courts. The same year, the US <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/us-asking-texas-to-rehear-cases-of.php">asked Texas</a> [JURIST report] to rehear the cases of 51 Mexicans sentenced to death in the state after their sentences were <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/imus/imusframe.htm">deemed improper</a> [ruling and case materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004_03_31_indexarch.htm#108073611218442417">report</a>] by the ICJ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> (EP) [official website] voted Thursday to adopt a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0361+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN">resolution</a> [text; EP <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/019-33526-189-07-28-902-20080707IPR33524-07-07-2008-2008-false/default_en.htm">press release</a>] calling on member states to &quot;review and repeal laws and policies that discriminate against the Roma on the basis of race and ethnicity.&quot;  The EP resolution also calls on the European Commission and EU member states to <blockquote>enact legislation and policies to support Roma communities while promoting their integration in all fields to launch anti-racism and anti-discrimination programmes in schools, employment and the media and to enhance the exchange of expertise and best practices [sic]</blockquote> The resolution was prompted by Italy&#39;s decision last week to begin implementing a controversial plan to fingerprint the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> [JURIST news archive]. The scheme has been condemned by some as constituting &quot;<a href="http://euobserver.com/22/26408">ethnic cataloguing</a>&quot; [EUobserver report] and was intensely <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-plan-to-fingerprint-roma.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1315385&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">international human rights community</a> [COE statement] and <a href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2958">Roma advocates</a> [ERRC materials].  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7500605.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Late last month, the Italian Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-court-overrules-racial-hatred.php">released a ruling</a> [JURIST report] overturning the convictions of six Italians, including Verona Mayor Flavio Tosi, for distributing anti-Roma literature in 2001 in a move some speculated was timed to bolster the fingerprinting plan. In November 2005, the <a href="http://www.eumc.eu.int/eumc/index.php">European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia</a> (EUMC) [advocacy website] reported that Roma minorities are the ethnic group <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/roma-facing-most-prejudice-in-european.php">most susceptible to racism in the European Union</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report]. A spokesman for an Italian NGO opposed to fingerprinting said Thursday that life expectancy for Roma living in Italy is already <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.2307678589">under 60</a> [AKI report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Italian <a href="http://www.camera.it/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian], the country&#39;s lower house of parliament, approved <a href="http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/stampati/pdf/16PDL0005720.pdf">legislation</a> [PDF text, in Italian; Draft Law 1442 <a href="http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg16/lavori/schedela/trovaschedacamera_wai.asp?pdl=1442">materials</a>] Thursday that would grant Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] and other high-ranking officials immunity from prosecution while in office. Berlusconi&#39;s government proposed the legislation, saying the officials needed to operate without fear of politically motivated prosecutions, but opponents have said the law is specifically tailored to suspend Berlusconi&#39;s own trial on <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi+corruption">corruption charges</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Chamber is also considering <a href="http://www.senato.it/service/PDF/PDFServer/BGT/00302147.pdf">public safety legislation</a> [PDF text, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-senate-approves-legislation.php">report</a>] that would suspend trials for non-violent crimes that occurred before 2002. Supporters say that the measure would help fix the congested criminal law system, but opponents say it is politically motivated because it would also suspend some of the charges against Berlusconi.  The immunity law passed the Chamber by a wide margin and is also expected to be approved when considered  by the Senate. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7501825.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Italy has recently faced significant criticism by both <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-criticized-for-dissolving-anti.php">advocacy groups</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-judges-threaten-strike-over.php">members of the country&#39;s judiciary</a> [JURIST reports] for relaxing its anti-corruption measures. The majority of the criticism has been targeted at Berlusconi, who has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports]. In October 2007, Italy&#39;s highest court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/italy-high-court-upholds-berlusconi.php">upheld</a> Berlusconi&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/berlusconi-acquitted-of-bribery-charges.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST reports] on bribery charges. That trial was initially blocked in 2004 by a bill drafted by Berlusconi ally and later defense lawyer Gaetano Pecorella but went ahead after the bill was struck down as unconstitutional. Berlusconi has said he is innocent on all charges and has accused prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Arab activist <a href="http://www.freesamialarian.com/home.htm">Sami Al-Arian</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sami+al-Arian">news archive</a>] was granted bail Thursday by a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/opinions/index.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], but it is speculated that he might be detained by immigration officials upon release. The former <a href="http://www.usf.edu/">University of South Florida</a> (USF) [official website]  computer science professor allegedly provided supported to terrorist organizations.   <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=261">Judge Leonie Brinkema</a> [official profile] agreed with the <a href="http://media.tbo.com/tbo/pdfs/070908alarian.pdf">motion for bail</a> [PDF text] made by Al-Arian&#39;s lawyers earlier this month, finding that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Al-Arian agreed to conditions for his release, such as electronic monitoring, to guarantee his appearance at his criminal contempt hearing scheduled for August. In his <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2008/07/10/dr-sami-al-arian-granted-bail/">blog</a> [post], Al-Arian&#39;s lawyer Jonathan Turley said that Brinkema was concerned about government interference with a plea agreement requiring Al-Arian to be deported following completion of his federal prison sentence. Brinkema reportedly said that the plea agreement still applied, preventing US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] officials from taking Al-Arian into custody, and that he could not be held indefinitely to prevent his deportation.&nbsp;The <font style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</font> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/10/AR2008071001319.html">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/10/america/NA-US-Attacks-Professor.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Al-Arian was <a href="/paperchase/2003/02/background-on-palestinian-usf.php">arrested in February 2003</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/alarian/usalarian0203ind.pdf">indicted</a> [PDF text] on charges of supporting terrorism based on comments he made in the wake of 9/11 and his association with an Islamic think tank at USF in the 1990s.  In 2005 he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/breaking-news-ex-professor-acquitted.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] on eight of 17 terrorism charges. The next year he <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/ex-professor-to-plead-guilty-to-terror.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to one charge of conspiring to provide services to the <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/pij.cfm">Palestinian Islamic Jihad</a> [CDI backgrounder] in violation of US law and agreed to be deported after serving a 57-month sentence.  Al-Arian then refused to testify before grand juries that were investigating a group of Islamic charities, and he was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-al-arian-sentenced-to-18.php">charged with contempt</a> [JURIST report].  Last year an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-appeals-court-affirms-civil.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the contempt ruling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/faa_complaint_20080710.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/35942prs20080710.html">press release</a>] against leaders of the US intelligence community on Thursday, acting on behalf of rights groups and activists. Filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, the action <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/faachallenge.html">challenges the constitutionality</a> [ACLU backgrounder] of the newly-amended <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text; JURIST <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">news archive</a>]. President George W. Bush <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6304enr.txt.pdf">signed the bill into law</a> [HR 6304 text, PDF; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080710-2.html">press release</a>] Thursday, allowing wider and less-regulated government monitoring of international communications. Bush said that the law is necessary to help intelligence officials keep the country safe, but critics, including ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero, have <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/35942prs20080710.html">argued</a> [press release] that it violates the Constitution and erodes privacy rights: <blockquote>Electronic surveillance must be conducted in a constitutional manner that affords the greatest possible protection for individual privacy and free speech rights. The new wiretapping law fails to provide fundamental safeguards that the Constitution unambiguously requires.</blockquote> The ACLU claims that the law violates the Fourth Amendment by allowing unjustified and unregulated surveillance, and violates the First Amendment by limiting the freedom of speech and the press. The complaint also alleges that the Act violates the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement and separation of powers. The ACLU asks the court to declare the law unconstitutional and to permanently enjoin such surveillance. The ACLU also filed a separate <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/fisc_motion_20080710.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] requesting that it be given leave to participate in all cases concerning the Act. The separate motion also requests that publications of all related motions and decisions be made available to the public. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Sun</span> has <a href="http://www.nysun.com/national/surveillance-bill-prompts-aclu-suit/81668/">more</a>.<br /><br />On Wednesday the US Senate voted <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00168">69-28</a> [roll call; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senate-rejects-bid-to-deny-immunity-for.php">report</a>] to approve the FISA amendment to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies participating in the <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">NSA warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive].   Earlier in the day, the Senate rejected three proposed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080708-7.html">amendments</a> [WH fact sheet] to the bill that would have limited immunity. Last month, the US House of Representatives <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2008/roll437.xml">passed</a> [roll call] HR 6304, amending FISA and including the granting of retroactive immunity. The bill also grants the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/patriot_foia/2003/court_rules.pdf">FISA court</a> [governing provisions] authority to review a wider range of wiretapping orders, would prohibit the executive branch from overriding the court&#39;s authority, and orders the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] and other agencies to issue a report on the country&#39;s use of wiretapping orders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/0718.P.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF opinion]. Thursday that Virginia&#39;s method of execution by <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">lethal injection</a> [JURIST news archive] does not violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.  Virginia death row inmate <a href="http://www.vadp.org/christopherscottemmett.html">Christopher Scott Emmett</a> [advocacy profile] had challenged the procedure, arguing that there is an unacceptable risk that the drugs used in the lethal injection cocktail would cause pain before taking their full effect.  The court based its ruling on the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/bazvree">Baze v. Rees</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/supreme-court-weighs-constitutionality.php">report</a>], in which the court held Kentucky&#39;s use of a <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&did=479#injection">three-drug lethal injection cocktail</a> [DPIC backgrounder] does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Judge William Traxler wrote the majority opinion, where he spoke about the similarities between Kentucky&#39;s lethal injection method approved in <u>Baze</u> and the method used in Virginia:<blockquote>Virginia is one of the thirty states that has adopted the three-drug combination discussed in <u>Baze</u>.  Although there are some minor variations, the protocol is largely identical to that of Kentucky and, like Kentucky&#39;s, includes a number of safeguards designed to ensure that the lethal chemicals are properly administered intravenously in a quick, humane fashion.<br /><br />Having reviewed the record de novo, we conclude that Virginia&#39;s protocol is substantially similar to Kentucky&#39;s protocol and that Emmett has failed as a matter of law to demonstrate a substantial or objectively intolerable risk that he will receive an inadequate dose of thiopental, particularly in light of the training and safeguards implemented by Virginia prior to and during the execution process. <br /><br />[I]t is enough to observe that Virginia is not constitutionally required to eliminate every possibility that pain might occur or every unnecessary risk that may exist.  Because Virginia&#39;s rapid-flow induction procedure does not present a &#8220;substantial&#8221; or &#8220;objectively intolerable&#8221; risk of serious harm to Emmett, its use is a judgment call entrusted to the officials of the Department of Corrections.</blockquote>According to the court, Virginia has executed 70 inmates using the lethal injection procedure.  AP has <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-lethal-injection-virginia,0,4922674.story">more</a>.  <br /><br />Emmett confessed and was convicted in October 2001 of capital murder and robbery of one of his co-workers.  In October 2007 the Supreme Court issued an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/emmett-order-10-17-07.doc">order</a> [DOC text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-supreme-court-stays-virginia-lethal.php">report</a>] staying Emmett&#39;s execution pending this decision by the Fourth Circuit.  The US had been under a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">de-facto moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty from September 2007 until April of this year, waiting for the Supreme Court to decide <u>Baze</u>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US and coalition forces have released more than 9,000 detainees in Iraq already this year, more than were released in all of 2007, according to a <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21085&Itemid=21">statement</a> [press release] issued Wednesday by the <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1">Multi-National Force-Iraq</a> (MNF-I) [official website].  The MNF-I reported that 9,047 detainees had been released in the year to date, while 8,956 were released in 2007.  The statement also indicated that coalition forces have are holding &quot;a steadily decreasing number of individuals determined to be security threat,&quot; and have used a &quot;holistic&quot; assessment program to determine the level of danger present by detainees. According to the press release, less than one percent of detainees released since September 2007 have re-entered the detention system. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNGORxlRDWfG2yDcOvs5bDQ_U-QD91QJ5N80">more</a>.<br /><br />Coalition detention practices have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months. Earlier this month, Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4493999.stm">Foreign Minister Moshyar Zebarai</a> [BBC profile] indicated that disagreements between the US and Iraq, including controversy concerning detainees, are <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement.php">still blocking a permanent Status of Forces Agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the two countries. In June, Physicians for Human Rights released a report <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doctors-examine-ex-detainees-find.php">substantiating claims of abuse and torture</a> [JURIST report] by detainees held in coalition prisons in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+detainees">Iraq</a>, <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+detainees">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+detainees">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives]. In May, a report released by the US Department of Justice found that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation were present when <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/fbi-agents-witnessed-did-not.php">&quot;borderline torture&quot; interrogation tactics were used on detainees</a> [JURIST report], including in Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Former White House advisor <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/results/leadership/bio_383.html">Karl Rove</a> [official profile] Wednesday refused to testify before a scheduled Thursday hearing of the US <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website; hearing <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/oversight.aspx?ID=460">materials</a>] in defiance of a subpoena. In May, the committee <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/22/rove.conyers/">subpoenaed</a> [CNN report] Rove to testify concerning any involvement in the prosecution of <a href="http://www.archives.state.al.us/lg_seigl.html">former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Siegelman">news archive</a>] on federal corruption charges in 2005. Rove Wednesday sent a <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFs/Rove080709.pdf">letter</a> [PDF text] to committee chairman <a href="http://www.house.gov/conyers/">John Conyers</a> (D-Mich) [official website] indicating that he is exerting executive privilege and would therefore not comply with the subpoena.  Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law chairwoman Linda Sanchez (D-CA) Thursday <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFs/Sanchez080710.pdf">rejected</a> [ruling, PDF; <a href="http://www.lindasanchez.house.gov/news.cfm/article/441">press release</a>] Rove&#39;s privilege claims:<blockquote>The courts have made clear that Executive Privilege applies only to discussions involving the President and to communications from or to presidential advisers &quot;in the course of preparing advice for the President.&quot; But the White House has maintained that the President never received any advice on, and was not himself involved in, the US Attorney firings and related events.<br /><br />The presidential communications privilege simply does not come into play here at all.<br /><br />For all the foregoing reasons, as stated more fully in my written ruling, I hereby rule that Mr. Rove&#39;s claims of immunity are not legally valid, and his refusal to comply with the subpoena and appear at this hearing to answer questions cannot be properly justified.<br /><br />These reasons are without prejudice to one another and to any other defects that may, after further examination, be found to exist in the asserted claims.</blockquote> Conyers and Sanchez sent a <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFs/Conyers-Sanchez080710.pdf">reply</a> [PDF text] to Rove Thursday, warning that the committee would pursue &quot;alternative recourse&quot; if he still refused to testify.  Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aKDYdLKwmRvY&refer=us">more</a>.  AP has additional <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080710/ap_on_go_co/rove_subpoena">coverage</a>.<br /><br />The committee&#39;s examination of Siegelman&#39;s case is part of a larger investigation into what it alleges is a pattern of politically-influenced selective prosecutions by the DOJ. In an April <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFS/SelProsReport080417.pdf">report</a> [PDF text], the committee highlighted a number of cases it says were brought as a result of political pressures, including those against former Allegheny County coroner Dr. Cyril Wecht and former Wisconsin procurement official Georgia Thompson. The report also said the DOJ has refused to cooperate with its investigation. In April, the committee <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFS/Com2Mukasey080417.pdf">asked</a> [letter, PDF] US Attorney General Michael Mukasey to turn over all DOJ documents and case materials pertaining to the matters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Korean prosecutors indicted two former naval officers on charges of stealing state secrets Thursday.  The two men, now working for German submarine manufacturer <a href="http://www.hdw.de/">Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft</a> [corporate website, in German], allegedly obtained classified documents about South Korea&#39;s submarine program from a navy captain, who is also under investigation.  AFP has <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080710/twl-skorea-germany-military-submarine-052abf5.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Cases involving the alleged theft of state secrets have been prevalent recently.

A MOD spokesman said the military had agreed to pay &pound;2.83 million in compensation, as well as issue an apology and an admission of liability.  The family of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3931023.stm">Baha Mousa</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mousa">news archive</a>], a tenth man who died in custody, was also included in the settlement.

The <em>Guardian</em> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/10/iraq.military">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Of the seven soldiers charged, only one, Corporal David Payne, faced <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/uk-soldier-jailed-for-abusing-iraqi.php">jail time</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/uk-soldier-first-to-plead-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] to a charge of inhumane treatment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The district court of The Hague ruled Thursday that it does not have jurisdiction to hear a case against the UN for its alleged failure to protect civilians during the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC timeline; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>]. Srebrenica survivors who filed the lawsuit alleged that both the Netherlands and the UN were liable for their failure to protect civilians who had fled to the camp after it was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/Res/819%281993%29">declared</a> [resolution, PDF] a &quot;safe area&quot; by the UN Security Council in 1993. The court began considering the case in November before conceding to the UN&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/un-claims-immunity-in-srebrenica.php">claim of immunity</a> [JURIST report; press briefing <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2007/db070608.doc.htm">transcript</a>] under the <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/%28httpAssets%29/C8297DB1DE8566F2C1256F2600348A73/$file/Convention%20P%20&%20I%20%281946%29%20-%20E.pdf">Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations</a> [text, PDF]. &nbsp;The ruling does not prevent the related case against the Netherlands from going forward, and a lawyer for the plaintiffs said that they will appeal the UN case ruling as far as the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website]. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5glExJfzoYz5GAffRrDpoE8jnKRRw">more</a>. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL10439141">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Tom Karremans, commander of the Dutch peacekeepers, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/dutch-un-commander-claims-troops-didnt.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 that Dutch troops could not intervene to protect the refugees because early phases of the massacre had initially been represented as an &quot;evacuation.&quot; An independent <a href="http://www.srebrenica.nl/en/opdracht.htm">report</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.srebrenica.nl/en/a_start.htm">Netherlands Institute for War Documentation</a> [official website] found that Bosnian Muslims had been mistakenly advised by Dutch troops to leave from the Srebrenica enclave, although it absolved the Dutch troops of blame because it said the peacekeepers were outnumbered, lightly armed, insufficiently supplied, denied air support, and under rules of engagement that permitted only self-defense.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.employmenttribunals.gov.uk/">Employment Tribunal</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/ladelejudgment.pdf">found</a> [judgment, PDF] for a central-London registrar who says she was harassed for refusing to perform same-sex civil unions on religious grounds.  Lillian Ladele alleged that her colleagues at the <a href="http://www.islington.gov.uk/">Islington Council</a> [official website] threatened and excluded her in retaliation for her beliefs, and she characterized the tribunal&#39;s decision as a victory for religious freedom. The council&#39;s Executive Member for Human Resources John Gilbert complained that the decision did not resolve questions over whether registrars could be required to perform civil partnerships.  He said the council was considering an appeal.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7499248.stm">more</a>. <br /><br />The tribunal&#39;s decision immediately sparked reaction from gay rights, secular, and religious groups.  Gay rights group Stonewall <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8314.html">denounced prejudice</a> [<em>Pink News</I> report] among marriage registrars.  The National Secular Society <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/registrarjudgementpotentiallycat.html">condemned the ruling</a> [press release], saying that public officials are required to perform their duties regardless of their personal beliefs, while the Christian Institute, which funded Ladele&#39;s representation before the tribunal, <a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/pressreleases/2008/07july/10jul08.htm">praised</a> [press release] the decision as preserving religious liberties.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/223BC532B50F6A0288257481004EBB36/$file/0616251.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that an Arizona election law requiring that independent presidential candidates register earlier than those affiliated with political parties was unconstitutional.  Presidential candidate <a href="http://www.votenader.org/">Ralph Nader</a> [campaign website] had filed a challenge to the deadline, arguing that it violated his rights to free speech under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First Amendment</a> [text].  <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/">Arizona Secretary of State Jan Brewer</a> [official website] had argued that the early registration requirement was necessary to give the state time to print accurate ballots, but the court ruled that the same deadline should be imposed on all candidates.  The appellate court also overturned a law that only state residents could circulate nomination petitions, finding that the regulation was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to address the state&#39;s ostensible anti-fraud goals.  Nader had argued the regulation violated his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] right to free association.  Brewer said that the state may appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court.  Capitol Media Services has <a href="http://www.yumasun.com/news/court_42855___article.html/run_door.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The case stems from Nader&#39;s 2004 presidency bid.  Also in 2004, Nader asked the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/Index/Supreme/IndexSupreme.asp">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website] to restore his name to the state&#39;s presidential ballot after the state Commonwealth Court <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/nader-ordered-on-ballot-in-pa-taken.php">invalidated his nominating petition</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/opposting/cwealth/out/568MD04_10-13-04.pdf">opinion and order</a>, PDF].  Nader argued that the Commonwealth Court erred in its decision by ruling that petition signatories needed to be registered voters rather than qualified electors.

Passage of the new treaty has been stalled since Irish voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected it last month</a> [JURIST report] in a national referendum, and Sarkozy has said he plans to go to the country on July 21 to seek a resolution.

RTE has <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0710/eulisbon.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Leaders from the 27 countries that make up the EU <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/eu-leaders-sign-reform-treaty.php">signed the reform treaty</a> [JURIST report] last December, and 14 countries had <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lisbon+treaty">ratified the document</a> [JURIST archive] before the Irish rejection. Several countries, including the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-house-of-lords-votes-to-ratify-eu.php">UK</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/netherlands-upper-house-approves-eu.php">Netherlands</a>, have continued their ratification processes, but Polish President Lech Kaczynski said <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/poland-president-refuses-to-sign-eu.php">signing the treaty would be pointless</a> in light of the rejection, and other leaders have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-council-to-discuss-lisbon.php">put off further consideration on ratification</a> [JURIST reports] until a meeting scheduled for October.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Philippine <a href="http://www.chr.gov.ph/index.php">Commission on Human Rights </a> (CHR) [official website] announced Thursday that it will investigate Australian mining company <a href="http://www.oceanagold.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=34&Itemid=83">Oceana Gold</a> [corporate website] for possible human rights violations at the site of a planned gold and copper mine in Didipio, Philippines. According to CHR chairwoman <a href="http://www.chr.gov.ph/MAIN%20PAGES/about%20us/member%20profile/LMDL_profile.htm">Leila M. De Lima</a> [official profile], Oceana Gold has been involved in the destruction of local homes near the mine site, as well as the physical intimidation, assault, and shootings of local residents opposed to construction of the mine. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5goC1uBtV2qahlBTQcicyjaOsqF3g">more</a>. The <em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em> has <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080710-147454/CHR-probes-raps-vs-Aussie-mine-firm">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Some advocacy groups, including <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/">Oxfam Australia</a> [advocacy website], have worked to spread awareness of local opposition to the <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/mining/ombudsman/cases/didipio/">Didipio mine</a> [Oxfam backgrounder]. Local activists believe that the planned open-air strip mine will cause unnecessary environmental and health risks, as well as destroy traditional farmland and endanger local culture. In September 2007, Oxfam Australia published a <a href="http://www.oxfam.org.au/campaigns/mining/ombudsman/cases/didipio/docs/2007-Didipio-Case-Report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by their mining ombudsman containing allegations that Oceana Gold and its representatives harassed and intimidated local residents, sought approval for the mining project in inappropriate ways such as through bribes, and sought to circumvent regulatory requirements to gain local consent for the mining project.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] released <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/KhadrDocuments.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday indicating that the Canadian government knew he had been mistreated at the detention center before agents questioned him in 2004. The documents include reports on interviews with Khadr, and were among those the government was compelled to hand over to Khadr&#39;s defense following a <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/rss/DES-1-08%20Decision.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-court-orders-release-of-khadr.php">report</a>] last month. One of the documents recounts Khadr&#39;s treatment before questioning by <a href="http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/international/index.aspx">Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade</a> [official website] intelligence officer Jim Gould over the course of four days in 2004 : <blockquote>In an effort to make him more amenable and willing to talk, [redacted] has placed Umar on the frequent flyer program: for the three weeks before Mr Gould&#39;s visit, Umar has not been permitted more than three hours in any one location. At three hour intervals he is moved to another cell block, thus denying him uninterrupted sleep and a continued change of neighbours. He will soon be placed in isolation for up to three weeks and then he will be interviewed again.</blockquote>Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that Khadr is facing severe criminal charges and that the Guantanamo process is necessary to discover the truth, but Khadr&#39;s lawyer said that Canada could easily secure Khadr&#39;s repatriation. Canwest has <a href="http://www.canada.com/cityguides/toronto/info/story.html?id=b1ff565a-71c1-4501-8bd6-0859816c1171">more</a>. The Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gtpUdw5XRvJlU-TxhwSmyxRJ-JuA">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Khadr faces life imprisonment for April 2007 <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and spying.

Oric was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/icty-convicts-former-bosnian-commander.php">convicted of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTY in June 2006 for failing to prevent the murder and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners&nbsp;in <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] by military police under his command.  The ICTY Appeals Chamber <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1269e-summary.htm">reversed his conviction</a> [judgment summary, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icty-appeals-court-overturns-conviction.php">report</a>] last week and said that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Oric knew or had reason to know the police he commanded would commit war crimes. In the statement, Russia said Oric&#39;s original sentence was unusually lenient, and that the acquittal showed the court&#39;s complete inability to serve as an impartial adjudicator.&nbsp;Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL103183420080710">more</a>.

Oric was charged with failing to prevent abuses by military police under his command, and was also charged with responsibility for destruction of Serb villages around Srebrenica. He was sentenced to two years in prison, but was released immediately following his conviction as he had already been detained for two years. Former ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/icty-prosecutor-appeals-light-sentence.php">appealed the sentence</a> [JURIST report] in July 2006, after having called for an 18-year prison term.

This renewed political drive to further Mediterranean interests must be reflected in the establishment of a genuine and equal partnership between the northern and southern rims.</blockquote>Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al-Maliki said the original declaration&#39;s reference to Israel as the &quot;state of the Jewish people&quot; and a &quot;national and democratic state,&quot; failed to recognized <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=palestinian">Palestinian</a>&nbsp;[JURIST news archive] interests in the country. The final version of the Union for the Mediterranean&#39;s text was&nbsp;vaguely&nbsp;worded in order to avoid this and other&nbsp;contentious&nbsp;details, but summit leaders have said they will continue to work on making the agreement more specific. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5imQG4hcC5GB2qa3VZTdhWOR38BLg">more</a>.<br /><br />The Union for the Mediterranean <a href="http://english.wafa.ps/?action=detail&id=11933">will include 43 countries</a> [WAFA report] from both Europe and the Middle East. It is designed to take the place of the 1995 <a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/r15001.htm">Euro-Mediterranean Partnership</a> [founding text; <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/euromed/index_en.htm">materials</a>], which was also&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;at&nbsp;promoting&nbsp;cooperation within the region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former vice president for <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/">Hewlett Packard</a>&nbsp;(HP) [corporate website] <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crm-607.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] Friday to one count of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/18usc1832.htm">theft of trade secrets</a> [18 USC s. 1832 text] for giving HP protected information he obtained while working for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> [corporate website]. Atul Malhotra said in his plea that before leaving IBM, he requested and received information on IBM&#39;s pricing and marketing strategies, which he then e-mailed to two HP executives during his employment there. HP spokeswoman Emma McCulloch <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=aozTiaSVg2uA&refer=canada">said</a> [Bloomberg report] that the company fired Malhotra after an internal investigation into the incident. Prosecutors <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/files/malhotrachargingdoc.pdf">formally charged</a> [indictment, PDF] Malhotra last month, and sentencing is scheduled for October 29. He could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressReleasesMolt/idUSWAT00976820080711">more</a>.<br /><br />The Department of Justice said that HP cooperated fully with the investigation, but the company has been under heavy legal scrutiny recently. In November 2007, HP subsidiary Mercury Interactive <a href="http://www.labaton.com/en/about/press/Labaton-Sucharow-LLP-Achieves-Largest-Settlement-Ever-in-a-Stock-Options-Backdating-Class-Action.cfm">settled</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/mercury-settles-stock-option-backdating.php">report</a>] derivative lawsuits regarding the alleged backdating of stock options. In March, a California judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/felony-charges-dropped-in-hewlett.php">dismissed felony charges</a> [JURIST report] against four defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in the HP <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hp">pretexting scandal</a> [JURIST news archive]. In December 2006, HP <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/hp-agrees-to-settle-california.php">settled an unfair business practices suit</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] brought by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer for $14.5 million. The backdating of Mercury option grants occurred before HP&#39;s acquisition of the company, but HP asserted that all liabilities for the backdating scandal would be handled without decreasing the value of HP&#39;s stock.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/home/index.shtml">Council of State</a> [official website, in French] has <a href="http://www.siawi.org/IMG/pdf/jugment.pdf">denied</a> [ruling, PDF, in French] a Moroccan-born Muslim woman&#39;s citizenship application because she failed to assimilate to French culture and she practices a type of Islam found incompatible with French values. The ruling was made public for the first time on Friday by the French newspaper <em>Le Monde</em>, which <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/07/11/une-marocaine-en-burqa-se-voit-refuser-la-nationalite-francaise_1072401_3224.html">reported</a> [text, in French] that the Council of State&#39;s decision marked the first occasion that the French government considered the level of religious practice in determining whether a person was fit for citizenship. The woman, identified only as Faiza M., is married to a French national, speaks French, has three children born in France, and wears a burka covering her entire body except her eyes. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL1173478020080711?sp=true">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7503757.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The perceived assimilation of Muslims has been a source of conflict in France during recent years.  In 2005, the French government <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/french-emergency-laws-helping-to-quell.php">authorized emergency powers</a> [JURIST report] to deal with rioting in Paris suburbs by poor immigrant youths.  The riots were generally attributed to larger race and religious issues in France, including the marginalization of immigrants and young people originally from Muslim countries. In 2004, the French government <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/french-headscarf-ban-takes-effect.htm">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] banning the wearing of conspicuous religious items, including Islamic headscarves, in public schools.

The group is believed responsible for bombing the headquarters of the newspaper <a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?em=cumhuriyet/w/c01.html"><em>Cumhuriyet</em></a> [newspaper website, in Turkish], assassinating Turkish-Armenian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>], and planning other attacks to provoke a military coup to topple the AKP.

News of the proposed warrant was first announced by US State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack, who confirmed the Monday hearings during a press briefing on Friday. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1210493420080712?sp=true">more</a>.

An indictment would mark the first-ever ICC effort to charge a sitting head of state with crimes against humanity and genocide. The Sudanese government has already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">refuses to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].   Hundreds of thousands of people have allegedly been killed in Darfur by Sudanese military and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2104210/">janjaweed</a> [<em>Slate</em> backgrounder] militia forces.  An ongoing probe said to involve more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries led Moreno-Ocampo to state before the <a href="www.un.org/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China executed two members of the <a href="/currentawareness/uighurs.php">Chinese Uighur Muslim</a> [JURIST news archive] ethnic minority last week, according to a report from US-funded <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/">Radio Free Asia</a> (RFA) [media website]. According to the <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/terror-07112008120250.html">report</a> [RFA report], the two Uighurs, Mukhtar Setiwalki and Abduweli Imin, were executed after a public announcement of their death sentences on July 9 in China&#39;s Xinjiang region. Two other Uighurs were given suspended death sentences, and another thirteen were given jail terms ranging from ten years to life imprisonment. The seventeen Uighurs were alleged to be members of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/03/mil-080312-cfr01.htm">East Turkestan Islamic Movement</a> (ETIM) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a militant group calling for separation from China, and which was designated as a terrorist group by the US government in 2002 for alleged links to al-Qaeda. The US has refused to release a number of Uighur detainees being held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] because of fears that they would be executed after their repatriation to China. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtXqlmt40KfwzHpDBCzoZBNtuoxQD91SA2OO1">more</a>.  AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jFE2vd7L8-k_tn404tf5GWxyZW-g">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />One of the Uighurs detained by the US, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=parhat">Huzaifa Parhat</a> [JURIST news archive], was designated an enemy combatant by a US Combatant Status Review Tribunal [DOD materials] and later challenged his detention in federal court. In June, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-enemy.php">ordered the US government to release Parhat</a> [JURIST report], ruling that he had been improperly designated as an enemy combatant. In 2006, five Chinese Uighur detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">released to Albania</a> [JURIST report], where officials reviewed applications for asylum. The transfer, which was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/china-wants-gitmo-uighurs-back-says.php">criticized by China</a>, ended a court challenge against the detainees&#39; <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/federal-judge-rules-chinese-gitmo.php">indefinite detention</a> [JURIST reports]. In December 2006, lawyers for seven Uighur detainees <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/chinese-guantanamo-detainees-file.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the process by which they were determined to be enemy combatants was flawed.

The three other permanent members of the Security Council, the US, Britain and France, voted in favor of the sanctions, arguing that such measures were needed to respond to the repression and violence linked to Zimbabwe&#8217;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+president+election">widely-discredited presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. The draft resolution was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-seeking-un-sanctions-against-mugabe.php">submitted by the US</a> [JURIST report] to the Security Council last week, and called for sanctions against Zimbabwe&#39;s newly reinstalled president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] and 13 of his top military and government officials. The draft resolution would have imposed a targeted sanctions scheme on Zimbabwe, including an embargo on all military or arms shipments and sales to the country, as well as travel bans and asset freezes on Mugabe and his associates.  The draft resolution also called for Zimbabwe&#39;s government to accept mediation efforts by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa-union.org%2F&ei=32ttSPeNNpTyeebTrdIC&usg=AFQjCNFhQ6FZ1FsJ5Ucd9iSL-6WdnWJ_jw&sig2=ti6dFZ8owz_o3h7tRfpv9Q">African Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sadc.int%2F&ei=NmxtSN6sBY6seb7K7NoC&usg=AFQjCNE6nrfIhzm0WxDwzc-L5QcjHpu42w&sig2=9pVDtcw-bUD8IPQx28zzag">Southern African Development Community</a>, and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official websites].

Tsvangirai is currently <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/un-condemns-zimbabwe-violence-after.php">taking refuge</a> [JURIST report] at the Dutch embassy in Harare. The MDC has estimated that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7438275.stm">at least 65 of its members have been killed</a> [BBC report] since the first election in March. Human rights groups suggested that state-sponsored violence would only increase as the second presidential vote drew closer, and in the past few weeks the amount of election-related violence has increased, including the <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5226047&page=1">beating</a> [ABC News report], <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=603140">torture</a> [<em>National Post</em> report], and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/world/africa/22zimbabwe.html?ref=africa">killing</a> [NYT report] of MDC supporters throughout Zimbabwe. Last month, Mugabe&#39;s government <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-expels-un-rights-envoy.php">expelled a UN human rights observer</a> [JURIST news report].

According to the proposal, if the information is deemed necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial, a summary of the information without personal details of the witnesses would be prepared and presented to the defense.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200807/05-1244-1127017.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion text, PDF] Friday that the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] does not have the authority to institute a &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; policy for controlling levels of soot and smog emissions.  The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cair/pdfs/cair_final_reg.pdf">Clean Air Interstate Rule</a> (CAIR) [PDF text, EPA <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cair/">backgrounder</a>] was intended to permanently cap emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides across 28 eastern states and would have reduced the levels of those pollutants by 70 percent and 60 percent respectively. The emission caps were expected to result in $85 to $100 billion in direct health benefits and almost $2 billion in visibility benefits by 2015.  The court&#39;s decision rejected the entire regulation, calling the EPA&#39;s approach to emissions control caps &quot;fundamentally flawed,&quot; and saying that the legislation would not &quot;survive remand in anything approaching recognizable form.&quot;  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbxOhRbC5B8oEFQBjaInpi27rS4wD91RPE480">more</a>.

Friday&#39;s ruling follows a February <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200802/05-1097a.pdf">decision</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-epa-power.php">report</a>] by the same court which held the EPA&#39;s <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/">Clean Air Mercury Rule</a> [EPA backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/new-epa-mercury-regs-to-cut-emissions.php">report</a>] to be invalid.  That rule intended to use a similar &quot;cap-and-trade&quot; policy to reduce mercury emissions from power plants by 70 percent.  The February decision was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bush-administration-asks-federal.php">appealed by the Bush administration</a> [JURIST report] in March.

Moreno-Ocampo is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/402.html">expected to present evidence</a> [ICC media advisory] of human rights crimes allegedly committed in the Sudanese region of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive]. Sudanese Foreign Affairs Minister Al-Samani al-Wasila counseled against the indictment, asserting that it would destroy the country&#39;s peace process. Sudanese Ambassador to the UN Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamed <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMU9_nxHnfBspo342jYG0nXyx7-gD91RST700">told reporters</a> [AP report] that <blockquote>If you indict our head of state, the symbol of our country, the symbol of our dignity, then the sky&#39;s the limit for our reactions ... It will have far-reaching, bad implications for the entire country.</blockquote>   In his comments, McCormack warned the Sudanese government not to respond with violence, reminding the country of its obligations under <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-council-passes-resolution-urging.php">UN Security Council resolutions</a> [JURIST report] as well as the <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:hO971hUp3EYJ:untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf+Vienna+Convention&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a">Vienna Convention</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] ruled Thursday in <a href="http://www.masslawyersweekly.com/index.cfm/archive/view/id/444039">Charron v. Amaral</a> [opinion text] that couples married after the court&#39;s decision legalizing same-sex marriage cannot make claims for benefits they would have received had they been allowed to marry sooner. The plaintiff in the case, Michelle Charron, brought a medical malpractice suit against a group of doctors for misdiagnosis of breast cancer in 2003.  When Charron died in 2006, her spouse Cynthia Kalish attempted to advance the lawsuit as a tort action for loss of consortium.  The couple were married less than a year after Charron&#39;s diagnosis following the court&#39;s 2004 decision in <a href="/same-sex.htm">Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">report</a>].  The court rejected Kalish&#39;s argument that she was entitled to relief because the couple would have married sooner had such marriage been legal, explaining that <em>Goodridge</em> was not to be applied retroactively. The court also stressed that allowing recovery in the case would open the door to increased litigation:<blockquote>We also reject Kalish&#39;s argument that we should allow her to recover for the loss of consortium because she meets all other criteria for recovery and would have been married but for the legal prohibition. Goodridge granted same-sex couples the right to choose to be married after a specific date; the court never stated that people in same-sex, committed relationships (including the Goodridge plaintiffs, who had applied for, and were denied, marriage licenses) would be considered married before they obtained a marriage license. ... Instead, as discussed, one of the grounds on which the Goodridge court based its decision regarding the constitutionality of the marriage licensing statute was that so many benefits flowed only from being married. ... [t]o allow Kalish to recover for a loss of consortium if she can prove she would have been married but for the ban on same-sex marriage could open numbers of cases in all areas of law to the same argument.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/07/10/mass_court_gay_couples_cant_claim_past_benefits/">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Herald</span> has <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view/2008_07_11_SJC:_Gay_couples_can%E2%80%99t_claim_pre-wed_benefits/srvc=home&position=recent">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 2003, Massachusetts became the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/06/14/a_timeline_of_events_involving_gay_marriage_in_massachusetts_1181860376/">first state to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span> timeline] with the state high court&#39;s decision in <u>Goodridge</u>. More than 8,500 same-sex couples have been married in Massachusetts since May 2004. In June 2007, Massachusetts lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/massachusetts-legislature-blocks.php">voted against</a> [JURIST report] allowing a statewide vote on a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/senate/185/st02/st02220.htm">proposed constitutional amendment</a> [text] defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] Friday <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-nsd-604.html">sentenced</a> [DOJ press release] a former US Department of Defense (DOD) official to almost five years in prison for disclosing national defense information to Chinese agents. Gregg William Bergersen, an analyst at the DOD&#39;s <a href="http://www.dsca.mil/">Defense Security Cooperation Agency</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/March/08_nsd_252.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dod-official-pleads-guilty-to-china.php">report</a>] to conspiracy for providing classified military information to Tai Kuo, a Louisiana businessman, who in turn gave the information to a Chinese foreign official.  Kuo also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and could be sentenced to life in prison.  In May, <a href="http://cicentre.com/Documents/kuo_kang_bergersen.html">Yu Xin Kang</a> [CICentre materials], a Chinese woman who is a permanent resident of New Orleans, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/chinese-national-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of aiding and abetting espionage by acting as an intermediary between Kuo and Bergersen.  Reuters has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080711/ts_nm/usa_espionage_china_dc">more</a>.<br /><br />In another Chinese espionage case, Dongfan &quot;Greg&quot; Chung, a former Chinese-American engineer at <a href="http://www.boeing.com/">Boeing</a> [corporate website], was arrested in February and charged with <a href="http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2008/images/02/11/final_chung_indictment.pdf">stealing corporate trade secrets</a> [PDF indictment] related to aerospace programs and turning them over to <a href="/countries/china.php">China</a> [JURIST news archive]. Chung&#39;s and Bergersen&#39;s activities were allegedly linked by <a href="http://cicentre.com/Documents/DOC_Chi_Mak.html">Chi Mak</a> [CI Centre backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/trial-of-us-engineer-accused-of-leaking.php">report</a>], a Chinese-American engineer <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/engineer-sentenced-to-over-24-years-in.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in March for conspiring to smuggle sensitive naval intelligence data to China.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit  <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Opinion%20(7-11-08).pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF; CREW <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/33123">press release</a>] a Bush administration appeal against a <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Lamberth%2012%2017%2007%20Order%20to%20Produce%20Records.pdf">2007 order</a> [PDF text] requiring that White House visitor logs be released in compliance with the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text].  The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the lower court had only ordered the White House to process a FOIA request rather than to disclose all documents.  In 2007, the district court <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1912-44">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/30613">White House visitor logs were public documents</a> [press release] and are thus subject to FOIA requests.  The Bush administration had argued that the logs are presidential property, meaning that they would fall outside the domain of the FOIA. Advocacy group <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW) [advocacy website] brought the lawsuit, seeking logs regarding the White House visits of prominent conservative religious figures, including James Dobson and Jerry Falwell.  AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080711/ap_on_go_pr_wh/white_house_secrecy">more</a>.<br /><br />In October 2006, US District Judge Ricardo Urbina ordered the Secret Service to <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-orders-cheney-visitor.php">release visitor logs</a> [JURIST report] for the personal residence and office of Vice President Dick Cheney. The order was issued following a lawsuit by the <em>Washington Post</em>, which had requested the logs in June while researching White House ties to political lobbyists. The Justice Department <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/bush-administration-appeals-cheney.php">filed an appeal against the order</a> [JURIST report] in December 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+lawyers+movement">Pakistan lawyers&#39; movement</a> [JURIST news archive] rallied Thursday against the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) [party website] and party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari for failing to reinstate judges deposed after the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-high-court-battles-musharraf.php">declaration of emergency</a> [JURIST report] by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Pervez Musharraf</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>] in November 2007. Among the deposed judges are a number of justices of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website], including former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Speakers at the protest, including prominent lawyers&#39; movement leader Hamid Khan, urged the PPP and the Pakistani government to implement the conditions of the <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/updates.asp?id=39768">Murree Accord</a> [<em>News</em> backgrounder], and indicated that the movement would not accept judges who had been appointed as a result of the declaration of emergency. From Pakistan, the<em>&nbsp;News</em> has <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15918">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, the reconstituted Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/pakistan-high-court-upholds-emergency.php">upheld Musharraf&#39;s declaration of emergency rule and the ouster of the judges</a> [JURIST report]. Days before the judgment, Pakistani Supreme Court Bar Association President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahsan">Aitzaz Ahsan</a> [JURIST news archive] strongly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/pakistan-bar-leader-criticizes-us.php">criticized US policy on Pakistan</a> [JURIST report], including its refusal to condemn the declaration of emergency rule. In June, members of the lawyers&#39; movement concluded a <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/pakistan-lawyers-reach-parliament-hold.php">&quot;long march&quot; protest</a> [JURIST report] from Lahore to Islamabad, calling for the reinstatement of the dismissed judges. Earlier that month, the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.

In its <a href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF20015A167.nsf/LookupContentDocsByKey/GOVI-7GDEGF?OpenDocument">response</a> [press release] to the claims, the Ministry rejected the IBAHRI&#39;s call for the country to provide increased protections of the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, and to ensure a more politically insulated judiciary. The Ministry said the group was biased in its assessment and that the country had <a href="http://notesapp.internet.gov.sg/__48256DF200173A1F.nsf/LookupMediaByKey/GOVI-7GDC4T/$file/IBAHRI%20Singapore's%20response%209%20April%2008.pdf">already responded</a> [PDF letter] to such concerns:<blockquote>Singapore, like nearly all countries, subscribes to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Human rights are interpreted and implemented according to the specific histories, cultures and circumstances of each country. Every society must find and decide the appropriate balance between rights and responsibilities for themselves. Human rights groups in IBAHRI have closed ranks with other Western human rights NGOs to prescribe for Singapore and all new countries, especially China, Western norms of liberal democracy as the only way to bring stability and prosperity. They believe that free market policies cannot succeed without Western liberal democracy, and it is their mission to make other societies adopt the Western model.</blockquote> AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieSWT6VcrvWzs38GxJ-IF3IYHf_w">more</a>. The&nbsp;<font style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</font> has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/STIStory_256242.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The IBAHRI made the claims in a <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/07_2008_July_Report_Singapore-Prosperity_versus_individual_rights.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/iba/article.cfm?article=178">press release</a>] issued Tuesday, when the group said the  Singapore government heavily regulated both international and domestic press, strictly limited public assemblies, had extreme defamation laws, and that there was an apparent judicial bias towards members of the ruling <a href="http://www.pap.org.sg/">People&#39;s Action Party</a> [party website]. In the report the group objected to previous culture-based justifications the country had provided for some of its policies, commenting that &quot;[d]espite debates between many nations as to the exact spectrum of human rights, fundamental and universal human rights cannot be considered culturally specific, but derive from the cultures of all countries.&quot; In June, a&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/singapore-charges-us-blogger-for.php">filed criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against a US blogger and former Singaporean lawyer for defaming one of the country&#39;s judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert</a> [official profile] misappropriated approximately $100,000 by double-billing different sources for travel and hotel expenses, Israeli police said Friday after questioning the politician.  Olmert&#39;s travel agency, Rishon Tours, would allegedly ask various state agencies and charities to pay Olmert&#39;s travel bills without telling them that other bodies were also being asked to pay the same bills.  The new allegations come as part of a continuing investigation into accusations of corruption surrounding Olmert&#39;s relationship with US businessman Morris Talansky.  State prosecutors say Olmert personally <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1210668673893&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">received cash payments</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/prosecutor-alleges-israel-pm-accepted.php">report</a>] from Talansky while serving as a minister of industry, trade and labor.  In May, police <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/israel-police-raid-olmert-offices-in.php">raided Olmert&#39;s offices</a> [JURIST report] in search of evidence.  Olmert has denied all wrongdoing.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080711/D91RNPBO0.html">more</a>. <em>Ha&#39;aretz</em> has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1001250.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Olmert has been accused of questionable business dealings for the past several years.  In April 2007, Olmert was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/israel-official-recommends-criminal.php">investigated for improperly favoring his supporters</a> [JURIST report] in distributing business grants during his time as trade minister. In January 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/israel-pm-facing-criminal.php">announced plans to launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that he promoted the interests of two business associates during the 2005 state sale of <a href="http://english.leumi.co.il/Home/0,2777,1415,00.html">Bank Leumi</a> [corporate website]. Throughout these scandals, Olmert has maintained that he is innocent. Law enforcement officials had indicated that the investigation into Olmert revealed <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/984650.html">evidence that could lead to additional charges</a> [<em>Ha&#39;aretz</em> report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office filed new corruption charges against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] in the country&#39;s Supreme Court Friday.  The charges relate to a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. A company then owned by Thaksin&#39;s family saw the greatest benefit from the new payment scheme, leading to claims that Thaksin misused his authority for personal gain.  Thaksin, who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ousted in a military coup</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, is involved in twenty-four legal actions.  On Tuesday, Thaksin went on trial on <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/thailand-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] related to a 2003 land purchase his wife arranged with a government-directed institution despite a ban on officials making business deals with government agencies.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080711/D91RK9500.html">more</a>. The <em>Bangkok Post</em> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=128818">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Also this week, the opposition Democrat party announced it would launch an impeachment bid against current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] after a series of court decisions against key government officials.  On Wednesday, the Thai <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Thai] dismissed Thai Public Health Minister Chaiya Sasomsup from office after finding he had violated finance laws by not declaring certain assets held by his wife.  On Tuesday, the court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-support-for-cambodia-heritage.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a June cabinet communique signed by Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama in support of a World Heritage site on Thailand&#39;s border with Cambodia was <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/download/news12_2551.pdf">unconstitutional</a> [PDF press release, in Thai]. Opposition parties moved to seek Noppadon&#39;s impeachment, but Noppadon <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=128808">stepped down</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] Thursday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/us-hamdan-opp-7-14-08.pdf">asked</a> [filing, PDF] a judge at the US District Court for the District of Columbia to deny a motion by Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>] to stay his trial, now scheduled to begin July 21. Hamdan&#39;s lawyers <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hamdan-prel-inj-motion-7-3-08.pdf">argued</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hamdan-legal-memo-7-3-08.pdf">memorandum</a>, PDF] earlier this month that the trial should be postponed until the court rules on the jurisdiction and legality of Hamdan&#39;s military commission, but the DOJ responded: <blockquote>Implicitly acknowledging that he has no serious challenge to the commission&#8217;s jurisdiction (much less a likelihood of success on the merits), petitioner instead argues that his trial by the military commission would result in a violation of various asserted constitutional rights. The Court need not reach these issues if it decides either that it lack[s] jurisdiction or that abstention is appropriate. In any event, it is far from clear that petitioner even has any claim to the constitutional rights asserted.</blockquote> The government said that the Supreme Court&#39;s recent ruling in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a>&nbsp;[opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>]&nbsp;only gave detainees the right to challenge their detention, not to challenge their trials once they became defendants, and that Hamdan&#39;s trial is legal because of his status as an alien, an illegal enemy combatant and someone charged with war violations. Hamdan&#39;s response is due Wednesday, and oral arguments are scheduled for Thursday. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gumKqqUAPNQ4o_RwZ3Tu6rw4j-tw">more</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001 when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system.  In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until July.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/">Washington DC City Council</a> on Tuesday passed <a href="http://dc.gov/mayor/pdf/showpdf.asp?pdfName=7-14_Firearms_Control_Emergency_Amendment_Act-July14_DRAFT.pdf">emergency temporary legislation</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.dc.gov/mayor/news/release.asp?id=1333&mon=200807">press release</a>] to amend the city&#39;s long-standing ban on handguns.  The amendment is intended to bring the city ordinance more in line with the recent US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/disvhel">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [Duke Law backgrounder], which found that the ban violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Second Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution.  The new rule requires residents to pass a background check, an eye exam, and a ballistics test before being allowed to register a gun.  It also restricts ownership to guns that carry less than 12 rounds of ammunition and mandates that guns either have trigger locks or be stored unloaded and unassembled.  The new rule will expire in 90 days, after which the council is scheduled to discuss more permanent gun legislation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish Justice Ministry Tuesday filed a challenge in Spain&#39;s <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] to block a planned Basque region referendum on increased autonomy.  The referendum, approved by the Basque Parliament last month, will ask citizens whether the <a href="http://www.euskadi.net/r33-2219/es/">Basque government</a> [official website] should begin negotiations for increased regional self-determination and whether it should initiate peace talks with Basque separatist group <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/547130.stm">ETA</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ETA">news archive</a>], provided that ETA renounces violence.  The planned referendum was officially recorded as law earlier Tuesday.  The national government has denounced it as illegal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/35968prs20080714.html">said</a> [press release] Monday that the US <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/counterrorism/faqs.htm">terrorist watchlist</a> [FBI FAQ] is too large, contains inaccuracies, and should include more safeguards to prevent the unnecessary targeting of passengers for additional security screenings. The group estimated that the register now includes <a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/watchlistcounter.html">more than one million names</a> [ACLU backgrounder], which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/15/aclu-errs-in-list-of-names/">accounts for about 400,000 people</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Washington Times</font> report] because of the list&#39;s inclusion of aliases. The group said the list was too large to be effective, often resulted in the screening of people with identical or similar names to those on the list, and included the names of deceased people. Director of the ACLU&#39;s Technology and Liberty Program, Barry Steinhardt, commented: <blockquote>America&#39;s new million record watch list is a perfect symbol for what&#39;s wrong with this administration&#39;s approach to security: it&#39;s unfair, out-of-control, a waste of resources, treats the rights of the innocent as an afterthought, and is a very real impediment in the lives of millions of travelers in this country. It must be fixed without delay.</blockquote> The ACLU called for tighter controls on the names placed on the register, the option to challenge placement on it, and access to information on how it is generated. Former Assistant Attorney General James Robinson is among those erroneously included on the roll, and he joined the ACLU in calling for its revision. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/usTopNews/idUKN1447675120080714?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/14/america/list.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In March, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/plus/a0816/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] saying that FBI had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/fbi-submitted-inaccurate-data-to.php">submitted inaccurate information to the list</a> [JURIST report], that the information was rarely reviewed before its submission, and even if discrepancies become apparent they were often left unchanged. In response to the audit, FBI Assistant Director John Miller said that the agency was <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/watchlist031708.htm">working with the DOJ and other partner agencies</a> [press release] to &quot;ensure the proper balance between national security protection and the need for accurate, efficient, and streamlined watchlist processes.&quot; In October, the US <a href="http://www.gao.gov/index.html">Government Accountability Office</a> [official website] said that the US terror watchlist <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-terror-watch-list-tops-755000-names.php">contained more than 755,000 names</a> [JURIST report], growing by about 200,000 names a year since 2004.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Belgian Prime Minister <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/nl">Yves Leterme</a> [personal website, in Dutch] <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/nl/actua/persberichten/ontslag-yves-leterme">submitted his resignation</a> [press release, in Dutch] Monday night because of his coalition government&#39;s inability to successfully divide federal powers between the Flemish- and French-speaking communities. Leterme had set a deadline of July 15 for the four-month-old <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/sites/leterme/files/regeerakkoord.pdf">coalition</a> [founding text, PDF, in Dutch] to agree on constitutional reforms to grant increased autonomy to the two regions. Leterme said that the current <a href="http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat/">federation system of Dutch government</a> [official backgrounder] was incapable of solving the problem, since the wealthier Flemish region wanted even greater autonomy and the Francophone region maintained that the Flemish move was meant to completely separate itself from the rest of the country. Belgium&#39;s King Albert II has reportedly <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/function/0,,12215_cid_3485181,00.html?maca=en-aa-news-862-rdf">rejected the resignation</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Deutsche Welle</span> report]. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080715/D91UCLTG1.html">more</a>. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a8xB7DnVA67w">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Dutch nationalist groups have pushed for the prosperous Dutch-speaking region of <a href="http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1166590837082&context=1166590833692--EN&pagename=flanders_site/View">Flanders</a>  [government website, in English] to become more autonomous, which has led to accusations that the province is seeking to break away from the poorer French-speaking province of <a href="http://www.wallonie.be/en/index.html">Wallonia</a> [government website, in French]. Last year, the country faced a <a href="http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=49798f08-52b9-4430-a940-37865ce441cc&k=86406&p=1">constitutional voting-rights disagreement</a> [Reuters report] over similar issues of linguistic regional autonomy after June elections failed to produce a cohesive government.  Talks to form a coalition government lasted more than six months, leading to concerns that the regions would separate into different countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on Tuesday <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/071124.P.pdf">upheld</a> [text, PDF] the dismissal of a libel case brought against the <em>New York Times</em> by former US Army biodefense research scientist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49717-2003Sep9?language=printer">Dr. Stephen Hatfill</a> [WP profile]. In its ruling, the court agreed with the decision of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia that Dr. Hatfill was a &quot;limited public figure&quot; and failed to prove that the <em>New York Times</em> used &quot;actual malice&quot; in publishing columns naming him as a suspect in a federal investigation into the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~cih/anthraxinfo/public/publicthreat_attacks.htm">2001 anthrax attacks</a> [GWU backgrounder]. &nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> columnist Nicholas Kristoff had profiled a suspect in the anthrax investigation, eventually naming Dr. Hatfill as the prime suspect. Dr. Hatfill was also named by then-US Attorney General John Ashcroft as a &quot;person of interest&quot; in the investigation. In its ruling, the court held that:<blockquote>Because Dr. Hatfill voluntarily thrust himself into the controversy surrounding the threat of bioterrorism and the nation&#8217;s lack of preparedness for a bioterrorism attack, we agree with the district court&#8217;s finding that he was a &quot;limited-purpose public figure&quot; and therefore was required to show actual malice. And because Dr. Hatfill did not demonstrate actual malice, the district court properly entered judgment in favor of The New York Times Company. We also conclude that Dr. Hatfill did not present evidence sufficient to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ggnSVGuQvX23iSN9fCYgtmUMsaBAD91TTREG1">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/business/media/15hatfill.html?ref=us">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Dr. Hatfill had also <a href="http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/hatfill/hatfillash82603cmp.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/bioterror-expert-can-question.php">report</a>] against the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] for damages as a result of DOJ violations of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm">US Privacy Act</a> [text].  That lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-hatfill-anthrax-settlement-may-moot.php">settled out-of-court</a> [JURIST report] last month. As a result of the settlement of that lawsuit, there is speculation that a landmark contempt case against former <em>USA Today</em> reporter <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=toni+locy">Toni Locy</a> [JURIST news archive] may be dismissed. Locy is currently appealing a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2003cv1793-224">contempt of court order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-holds-anthrax-reporter-in.php">report</a>] for refusing to disclose government sources who provided information about Hatfill, and had faced significant monetary fines until an appeals court&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rcfp.org/shields_and_subpoenas/hatfill_locy_stay.pdf">granted</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-blocks-contempt.php">report</a>] an emergency stay against the monetary sanctions while Locy pursued her appeal.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Italian court Monday found 15 police officers and medical staff members guilty of <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/italian-police-medical-staff-on-trial.php">abusing anti-globalization protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were taken into custody during the <a href="http://www.g8italia.it/_en/index.html">2001 G8 summit in Genoa</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1451845.stm">backgrounder</a>]. The protesters said they were subjected to threats and physical abuse, and were denied food and access to their consulates while being held in a Genoa detention center. The court found the officials guilty of crimes ranging from abuse to inhuman and degrading treatment, but cleared the charges of 30 others. A lawyer for the officials said they <a href="http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.2339206469">plan to appeal the ruling</a> [Adnkronos report], and the protesters are also expected to file a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/2301587/Italian-police-officers-found-guilty-over-G8-protest-brutality.html">civil suit</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Telegraph</font> report] against the government for the mistreatment.  The court is still considering a separate case in which police are accused of abuses stemming from the raid on a school where other protesters were staying during the summit. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/15/europe/EU-Italy-G-8-Violence.php">more</a>. <font style="font-style: italic;">Corriere della Sera</font> has <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_luglio_14/bolzaneto_sentenza_condanna_g8_6ad6341c-51de-11dd-a6b4-00144f02aabc.shtml">local coverage</a>, in Italian.<br /><br />Immediately after the protests and reports of abuse, Amnesty International (AI) <a href="http://www.dyne.org/antig8/text/amnesty-release.html">called for a full investigation</a> [press release] into the mistreatment. In July 2006 the group urged the Italian government to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGEUR300052006&lang=e">institute reforms to prevent future abuses</a> [press release], but said that the government had not done so in the five years since the incident.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Australian Federal Court <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2008/130.html">ruled</a> [opinion] Tuesday that a law giving police regulatory powers over potentially &quot;annoying&quot; behavior during <a href="http://www.wyd2008.org/">World Youth Day</a> (WYD) [official website] was unconstitutional and possibly exceeded legislative intent. Section 7(1)(b) of the <a href="http://www.nswbar.asn.au/circulars/july/wyd_reg2.pdf">World Youth Day Amendment Regulation 2008</a> [text, PDF], designed to amend and supplement Section 58 of the original <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wyda2006199/">World Youth Day Act 2006</a> [text], allowed officials to fine those who failed to comply with police orders up to $5,500 AUD. Activists from the <a href="http://www.notopope.com/news.php">NoToPope Coalition</a> (NTPC) [organization website] who planned to protest some of Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s social viewpoints during his WYD visit <a href="http://www.notopope.com/news.php?item.4">sued</a> [NTPC press release], saying the law abridged their freedom of communication and overstepped legislative intent. In its opinion, the court agreed that freedoms could only be so limited through clear legislative intent, and wrote that : <blockquote>[T]he conduct regulated by cl 7(1)(b) so far as it relates to &quot;annoyance&quot; may extend to expressions of opinion which neither disrupt nor interfere with the freedoms of others, nor are objectively offensive in the sense traditionally used in State criminal statutes. Breach of this provision as drafted affects freedom of speech in a way that, in our opinion, is not supported by the statutory power conferred by s 58 properly construed. Moreover there is no intelligible boundary within which the &quot;causes annoyance&quot; limb of s 7 can be read down to save it as a valid expression of the regulating power.</blockquote> The court upheld the Regulation&#39;s other provisions, deeming them protections of public safety and the rights of others. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span> has <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world-youth-day/court-dumps-annoy-law/2008/07/15/1215887596459.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-J_7J0KBYEpAKggMq9vnpk8KpIwD91U29J00">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The NoToPope Coalition members planned to hand out condoms, stickers, t-shirts, flyers and other materials during WYD events to show support for reproductive freedom, sexual tolerance and contraception. The Pope has generally <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2007/may/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20070513_conference-aparecida_en.html">condemned</a> [speech text] abortion, contraception, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/france-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">same-sex marriage</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/pope-condemns-same-sex-marriage-as-new.php">civil unions</a> [JURIST reports], in addition to other &quot;non-conservative&quot; reproductive and sexual policies and viewpoints.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Indonesia">Indonesia</a> [JURIST news archive] on Tuesday formally accepted a joint Indonesian-East-Timorese <a href="http://www.ctf-ri-tl.org/">Commission of Truth and Friendship</a> (CTF) [official website] finding that Indonesia was responsible for human rights violations following a 1999 referendum in which <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1996673.stm">East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia</a> [BBC backgrounder].  This is the first time that Indonesia has accepted any responsibility for the attacks in East Timor, which it has previously blamed on local militias.  In a report obtained by AFP, CTF suggested that perpetrators of the violence be brought before a human rights court.  Both Indonesian and East Timorese leaders rejected calls for prosecution, noting that it could hinder the reconciliation process between the two nations, but <a href="http://www.presidensby.info/index.php/eng/index.html">Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [official website] promised to implement other recommendations by the CTF.

The <em>Los Angeles Times</I> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-easttimor16-2008jul16,0,2899884.story">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized the CTF for <A src="/paperchase/2007/07/un-officials-will-not-testify-at-east.php">violating international humanitarian standards</A> [JURIST report] because it allowed amnesty for some perpetrators of crimes against humanity. Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/indonesia-official-rebukes-un-sg-on.php">responded</a>  [JURIST report] that the government of East Timor had voluntarily agreed to the CTF to resolve past disputes without injuring long-term relations with Indonesia.  The East Timorese government has rejected the establishment of an international tribunal to try those responsible for human rights abuses allegedly committed after the 1999 referendum.  Ban indicated that UN officials <A HREF="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sgsm11101.doc.htm">would not testify</A> [press release] before the CTF and that the UN &quot;would not support the work of the CTF and thereby further the possible grant of amnesties.&quot; The CTF, <A HREF="http://www.etan.org/et2005/march/06/10tor.htm">established</A> [terms of reference] in 2005 by the East Timorese and Indonesian governments, does not have independent authority to prosecute suspects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST news archive] following his failure to appear at a Malaysian police station to give a statement regarding <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy allegations</a> [JURIST report] made against him by a former aide. According to police, Ibrahim had been scheduled to appear at the Kuala Lumpur Police Headquarters Monday at 2:00 PM to make the statement, but Anwar&#39;s lawyer&nbsp;<a href="http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2008/07/15/press-statement-anwar-ibrahim-to-give-statement-to-police-wednesday-at-200-pm-arrest-warrent-issued/">asserted</a> [Anwar blog post] he had been told the deadline would be Wednesday at 2:00 PM. The lawyer indicated that Anwar intends to comply with the government&#39;s request, and that he will give a statement Wednesday morning to the <a href="http://www.bpr.gov.my/cda/m_home/index.php">Malaysian Anti Corruption Agency</a> [official website]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvk18e1IzUJ9V-VNzo1_wg-4mkWgD91U83780">more</a>. From Malaysia, the <em>Daily Star</em> has <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/15/nation/20080715133758&sec=nation">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Anwar has claimed that the sodomy allegations leveled against him are politically motivated, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June.  Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Earlier this month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>] released an <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/video/vs?id=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715&ids=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715,RTGAM.20080710.wharper_khadr0710">excerpt</a> [video; <a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2008/07/15/video-showing-omar-khadr-released-by-lawyers.aspx">transcript</a>] Tuesday of a 2003 interrogation of Khadr conducted by Canadian officials, marking the first time Guantanamo interrogation footage has been available to the public. The eight-minute clip is part of seven hours of footage given to lawyers after the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc28/2008scc28.html">ruled</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/canada-supreme-court-rules-for-khadr-in.php">report</a>] in May that Khadr had the right under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text] to see confidential documents and videos compiled by Canadian officials. The video does not show torture, but <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/KhadrDocuments.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-documents-show-canada-knew-of-khadr.php">report</a>] released last week indicated that the Canadian government knew Khadr had been mistreated at the detention center before agents questioned him. In the video, Khadr, then 16, becomes nonresponsive, and the interrogator responds: <blockquote>I understand this is stressful, but by using this as a strategy to talk to us, it&#8217;s not going to be any more helpful. We have a limited amount of time, and we&#8217;ve heard this story before.</blockquote> The interrogator later asks whether Khadr would like a chocolate bar, and when Khadr responds that he wants to go back to Canada, the interrogator says he cannot help. The interrogator&#39;s comments echo statements made last week by Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper that Khadr is facing severe criminal charges and that the Guantanamo process is necessary to discover the truth. However, Khadr&#39;s lawyers and rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/canada-pm-criticized-for-not.php">criticized Harper</a> [JURIST report], saying that Canada could easily intervene on Khadr&#39;s behalf. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe and Mail</span> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080715.w2khadr15/BNStory/International/home">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7507216.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Khadr could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted of April 2007 <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying. Khadr is <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">one of four</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees facing prosecution under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF]. On March 13, a US military judge also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/us-military-judge-orders-disclosure-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that some correspondence between US and Canadian government officials regarding Khadr must be turned over to Khadr&#39;s defense team. In an affidavit released in early May, Khadr <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guantanamo-detainee-khadr-accuses-us.php">accused US interrogators of mistreatment</a> [JURIST report], including threatening him with rape, physically abusing him, and forcing him to swear to false statements.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the US <a href="http://src.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Senate Republican Conference</a> [official website] Monday <a href="rtsp://video1.c-span.org/15days/e071408_justice.rm">called</a> [C-Span video, RM] for an end to delays in considering federal district and circuit court judges nominated by President George W. Bush.&nbsp;Members of the Conference said the delays have lead to chronic under-staffing of federal courts and that some courts have only three quarters of their positions filled, leading to case backlogs and the extensive use of visiting judges. Speaking before the Conference, Northwestern University law professor&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/faculty/profiles/JohnMcGinnis/">John McGinnis</a>&nbsp;[faculty profile] said the delays make the confirmation process less transparent and ultimately decreases confidence in the federal court system. McGinnis said the problem was structural rather than partisan, and called for new rules setting concrete timelines to govern the nomination process.&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;<a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) [official website] accused <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=senate+judiciary">news archive</a>]&nbsp;Democrats of trying to stall until after the presidential election.&nbsp;Senate Judiciary Committee chair&nbsp;<a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a>&nbsp;(D-VT) [official website] has said that such delays are <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200409/090804A.html">common practice in election years</a> and that federal court vacancies have actually&nbsp;<a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200806/062608e.html">decreased during president Bush&#39;s term</a>&nbsp;[press releases].&nbsp;<br /><br />Steve Rutkus of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/aboutcrs.html">Congressional Research Service</a> [official website] told the Conference that since 1980, under both Republican and Democratic control, the average time for the Senate to take final action on a successful district court nominee has <a href="http://src.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Graphics.ViewLarge&File_id=8e6082c8-8094-4955-851d-465f8a4fe915">almost tripled</a> [nomination chart]. In November 2007, President Bush <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/bush-slams-unfair-senate-review-of.php">criticized the Senate</a> [JURIST report] for taking too long to confirm his nominees to the bench, saying the body had overstepped its mandate to &quot;advise and consent&quot; on nominees and was instead setting out to &quot;search and destroy.&quot;&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Federal Reserve Board on Monday <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/meetings/2008/20080714/draftfedreg.pdf">approved new rules for home mortgage loans</a> [draft regulations, PDF; <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20080714a.htm">press release</a>] designed to reduce unfair lending practices and increase consumer protection. The new rule amends the <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr226_main_02.tpl">Truth in Lending Act</a> [text] to include prohibitions against granting loans without a verification of the borrower&#39;s ability to repay, bans on some debt prepayment penalties and requirements that lenders sometimes establish escrow accounts and homeowner&#39;s insurance. Lenders will also be prohibited from coercing appraisers to falsely represent a home&#39;s value, using unfair fee structures and misrepresenting or failing to provide an account of total loan costs. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bernankeregz20080714.htm">said</a> [transcript] at the board meeting: <blockquote>Besides offering broader protection for consumers, a uniform set of rules will level the playing field for lenders and increase competition in the mortgage market, to the ultimate benefit of borrowers.  We will work collaboratively with our fellow regulators, both state and federal, to see that the rules are consistently applied and vigorously enforced.</blockquote> Most of the rules will go into effect on Oct. 1, 2009. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aejBj0fFSjpo&refer=home">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jGNuq2pHSp6u2FpKHM-QPCHxfF9Q">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] announced that more than <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mortgagefraud061908.htm">400 people had been indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/fbi-names-more-than-400-in-mortgage.php">report</a>] in connection with what has been termed the US &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot; Most of the indictments involved fraud related to individual mortgages, with the FBI focusing on lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes, which account for more than $1 billion in losses. The same day, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] also announced the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/dealbook/cioffi_indictment.pdf">indictments</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2008/2008jun19.html">press release</a>] of two senior hedge fund managers at <a href="http://www.bearstearns.com/">Bear Stearns</a> [corporate website] for allegedly misleading investors even after they knew their mortgage-related funds were at serious risk of collapse.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A New York district court judge <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=83">ruled</a> [PDF text] Monday that Internet auction house <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/aboutebay.html?_trksid=m40">eBay</a> [corporate website] is not required to actively monitor its website for the sale of counterfeit goods.  The decision comes in a case brought by jeweler <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">Tiffany &amp; Company</a> [corporate website], alleging that eBay diluted its trademark by facilitating the sale of &quot;copycat&quot; Tiffany jewelry. EBay argued that it had no responsibility to take proactive steps against the sale of counterfeit items.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hXeQePJlK7cDWUwmo5QqUfV_F_twD91TO4V00">more</a>.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/technology/15ebay.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The decision marks a dramatic contrast with recent rulings in Europe, where a French court earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">ordered</a>  [JURIST report] eBay to pay $63 million in damages to <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Mo&euml;t Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [corporate website] for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods.  EBay said that it <a href="http://news.ebay.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=319007">would appeal the decision</a> [press release].  LVMH praised the holding as a victory for designers seeking to control the distribution of their merchandise or prevent the sale of &quot;copycat&quot; products.  Last month, another French court ruled against eBay in a similar lawsuit for failing to prevent the sale of fake <a href="http://www.hermes-international.com/fr/2008/doc_info_annuel.php">Herm&egrave;s International SCA</a> [corporate website] products.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-2.html">memorandum</a> [presidential statement] Monday to the Secretary of the Interior, lifting an executive ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive] put in place in 1990 by then-President George H. W. Bush.  Monday&#39;s action will have little practical effect because offshore drilling is still prohibited by a longstanding congressional moratorium.  The limitation on the practice has been in place since 1981, and makes 85 percent of the coastal waters surrounding the US off-limits for oil drilling.  On Monday, the League of Conservation Voters <a href="http://www.lcv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lcv-responds-to-lifting-of-executive-offshore-drilling-ban.html">condemned</a>  [press release] Bush&#39;s move as a reckless temporary solution to the current oil crisis.   Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/businessIndustry/idUKN1437813720080714?sp=true">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/14/AR2008071401049.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html">called on Congress to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">report</a>], saying that it should also allow drilling to begin in the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> [official website] in Alaska.  Bush argued that resources currently off-limits to energy companies could offset rising fuel prices.  Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] in the Arctic, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require several years and a massive infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian government leaders <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/govt/crownshare/Agreement_11-july-en.pdf">reached an agreement</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/govt/crownshare/CROWN_NR-en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] with Nova Scotian officials on Sunday which requires the Canadian government to pay the province $235 million CAD for lost profits from prior government offshore oil and gas projects. In 1980, the Canadian government <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/govt/crownshare/CROWN_BK-en.pdf">obtained the right</a> [program backgrounder, PDF] to buy partial ownership in private Canadian oil and gas projects, including those off the coast of Nova Scotia. The province obtained the rights to some of the profits in 1982, and in 1986 the federal government abolished its 1980 share rights and agreed to <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/c-7.8">compensate the province</a> [agreement materials] for its lost profits. Compensation provisions remained unclear until an independent panel recently <a href="http://gov.ns.ca/govt/crownshare/Chairs-Recommendations-en.pdf">recommended</a> [text, PDF] a payment amount and a timetable for the reparations, which the governments adopted. The Canadian government will also pay the province an estimated $633 million CAD over the next 15 years for current and future oil and gas projects. Nova Scotian Premier Rodney MacDonald <a href="http://www.gov.ns.ca/premier/speeches/2008-07-13-crownshare.asp">said</a> [speech text] of the agreement: <blockquote>Fiscal responsibility is the cornerstone of our province and our government. Ninety-two per cent of Crown Share payments &#8212; or about $800 million &#8212; will be applied to the provincial debt. Over time, these payments will free up millions of dollars in debt servicing costs each year, money which will be invested in the priorities of Nova Scotians. [sic]</blockquote> The <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe and Mail</span> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080714.wnova14/BNStory/National">more</a>.<br /><br />The agreement made in 1986 required the federal government to pay Nova Scotia 75 percent of the government&#39;s profits as soon as the earnings reached $200 million CAD on any eligible oil or gas operation off the Nova Scotia coast. The provincial and federal governments had disagreed on the exact terms of the payments, but profits only recently reached the required amount on the first qualifying operation, the <a href="http://www.soep.com/cgi-bin/getpage?pageid=0/0/1">Sable Project</a> [official website].

The application follows a three-year investigation into atrocities and genocide in Darfur that began with the <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-us-allows-icc.php">referral of the situation to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor in 2005</a> [JURIST report]. Since then, the Office of the Prosecutor has gathered eyewitness and victim statements, taken testimony from Sudanese government officials, and examined material provided by the UN and other aid organizations in order to build evidence to support the charges against al-Bashir. The summary of the charges against al-Bashir notes:<blockquote>The evidence establishes reasonable grounds to believe that AL BASHIR intends to destroy in substantial part the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups as such. Forces and agents controlled by AL BASHIR attacked civilians in towns and villages inhabited by the target groups, committing killings, rapes, torture and destroying means of livelihood. AL BASHIR has thus forced the displacement of a substantial part of the target groups and attacked them in the camps for internally displaced persons (&#8220;IDPs&#8221;), causing serious and bodily harm &#8211; through rapes, tortures and forced displacement in traumatizing conditions &#8211; and deliberately inflicting on a substantial part of those groups conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.<br /><br />AL BASHIR&#8217;s conduct simultaneously constitutes genocide against the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa ethnic groups, crimes against humanity and war crimes against any civilian population in the area, including members of the target groups. [sic]</blockquote>The indictment and charges against Al-Bashir mark the first time a sitting head of state has been charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the ICC. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7504640.stm">more</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/world/africa/15sudan.html?ref=world">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />News of Monday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] began circulating Friday. The Sudanese government has already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">has refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].   Hundreds of thousands of people have allegedly been killed in Darfur by Sudanese military and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2104210/">janjaweed</a> [<em>Slate</em> backgrounder] militia forces.  The investigation that resulted in Monday&#39;s charges, which involved more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, led Moreno-Ocampo to state before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221; The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a> [JURIST], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bger.ch/">Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in German] Monday ruled that <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/index.cfm">Doctors without Borders</a> (MSF) [advocacy website] must repay the Dutch government for its share of a ransom paid to secure the release of a MSF official. MSF&#39;s former Dagestan head was <a href="http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=324A700A-D3C4-4FAF-8C87BED78CBF38D7&method=full_html">kidnapped in 2002</a> [MSF backgrounder], and his abductors demanded 1 million euros in ransom.  The Dutch government contributed 770,000 euros to the aid worker&#39;s release, of which it said 270,000 euros was meant as a loan to MSF.  MSF denied that the money was intended as a loan and refused repayment, instead seeking reimbursement from Holland for its share of the ransom. The court rejected MSF&#39;s claim for compensation.  Ria Novosti has <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20080714/113952473.html">more</a>.  AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/14/europe/EU-Switzerland-Netherlands-Aid-Worker.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Dagestan has become an increasingly volatile region in recent years.  Earlier this year, Russian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/russia-prosecutors-open-murder.php">opened a murder investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of journalist  <a href="http://shurpaev.livejournal.com/">Ilyas Shurpayev</a> [personal blog], a correspondent for Russia&#39;s state-run <a href="http://www.1tv.ru/owa/win/ort8_main.main">Channel One</a> [media website, in Russian], who was found dead with stab wounds and a belt around his neck when firefighters responded to a fire, apparently set after the attack. Hours before his death, Shurpayev reportedly wrote a blog post complaining that he had been banned from writing columns for a newspaper in Dagestan and proclaiming, &quot;I am now a dissident.&quot;  The same day, the head of Dagestan&#39;s state TV and radio company Gadzhi Abashilov was killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire on his car. <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika</a> [official website, in Russian] said he would take &quot;personal&quot; charge of the Abashilov investigation.

The Appeals Chamber found that the Trial Chamber had erred by finding Strugar not guilty on counts of devastation and unlawful attacks against civilians.  It also reduced Strugar&#39;s sentence to seven and a half years&#8217; imprisonment in consideration of his poor health.

Strugar, who commanded Yugoslav forces during the siege, was found guilty of violating Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/basic/statut/stat02-2006.htm">Statute of the Tribunal</a> [text], which governs the laws of war.  The Trial Chamber found him not guilty on four other counts, including murder, cruel treatment, devastation unjustified by military necessity, and unlawful attack on civilian objects.

Lawyers for the three said they had been denied an earlier opportunity to present expert testimony in their clients&#39; defense, but the court dismissed the request for a new hearing, and said that it would not accept additional appeals. Under Indonesian law, the only remaining way for the three to avoid execution is to be granted a presidential pardon, but they have thus far refused to request one.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military judge has&nbsp;<a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/07/16/18/Expostfacto.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">denied</a> [ruling, PDF] a motion to dismiss by Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>], holding that the military commission assigned to his trial has the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the case. Hamdan&#39;s lawyers <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2008/d20080207hamdenmotions.pdf">moved for dismissal of the&nbsp;charges</a> [motions, PDF] in January, arguing that because the charges of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism did not exist at the time Hamdan allegedly committed them, they violated the&nbsp;<font style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</font> clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html#section9">US Constitution</a>&nbsp;and Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/AP-Guantanamo-Geneva-Conventions.html">Geneva Conventions</a> [texts]. They said that the charges only became crimes after the passage of the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [DOD materials], and that they could not be applied retroactively. The judge rejected the argument, writing that Congress&#39;s passage of the MCA was appropriate and allowed the charges against Hamdan: <blockquote>In light of Congress&#39;s enumerated power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations, and its express declaration that in doing so, it had not enacted a &quot;new crimes that did not exist before its enactment&quot;, the Commission is inclined to defer to Congress&#39;s determination that this is not a new offense. There is adequate historical basis for this determination with respect to each of these offenses.</blockquote>A federal judge in DC had been scheduled to hear oral arguments Thursday on whether to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-calls-for-hamdan.php">stay Hamdan&#39;s trial</a> [JURIST report] awaiting the ruling of the Commission&#39;s&nbsp;jurisdiction, but that issue is now moot. Hamdan&#39;s trial is currently scheduled to begin July 21. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/guantanamo/story/607242.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001 when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the MCA, which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until this month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK parliament</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080716/debtext/80716-0022.htm#080716101000001">approved</a> [debate text] legislation Wednesday that would allow the use of testimony from anonymous witnesses at criminal trials.  The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmbills/134/2008134.pdf">Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008</a> [text, PDF; parliament <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/criminalevidencewitnessanonymity.html">backgrounder</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-seeks-permission-of-anonymous.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] last month by UK Justice Secretary <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/straw.htm">Jack Straw</a> [official profile] as an emergency measure following the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/HofLBpJudicial.pdf">Law Lords</a> [government backgrounder, PDF] ruling in <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080618/davis.pdf"><u>Regina v. Davis</u></a> [PDF text], which challenged the recently adopted judicial practice of permitting anonymous witnesses in specific cases.  According to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/witness-anonymity-bill.htm">statement</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website]:<blockquote>[The Bill] makes provision for any party to criminal proceedings to apply for a witness anonymity order, so either the prosecution or a defendant may apply, [it] sets out the conditions which must be satisfied before a court can make a witness anonymity order and the considerations the court must have regard to when deciding whether to make an order, [it] sets out an indicative list of the kinds of special measures that the courts may apply in order to protect the identity of an anonymous witness, for example, the use of screens and voice distortion, [and it] makes transitional provisions in respect of the trials under way when the Act comes into force and in respect of the hearing of appeals against convictions secured on the basis of anonymous evidence before the passing of the Act.</blockquote>The bill passed the House of Commons on July 8. An amended version passed the House of Lords Wednesday and was then approved by the full Parliament. It must now receive royal approval before becoming law.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7510641.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />The approval came after a judge <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=383&sid=1427933">suspended a murder trial</a> [AP report] last month because the jury had heard testimony from anonymous witnesses.  At the same time the office of <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page12037.asp">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page15842.asp">commented</a> [press briefing] that the ruling in <u>Davis</u> &quot;was something we were looking at urgently, including looking at whether or not we could change the law.&quot;  Prime Minister Brown then <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jun/25/justice.law">announced</a> [Guardian report] that the government was going to push the legislation, which must conform to the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1">Human Rights Act</a> [text].

		<title>Homeowner&#039;s insurance does not cover failure to prevent sexual abuse: Wisconsin court</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Supreme Court of Wisconsin</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=33435">ruled</a> [opinion text, PDF] that a homeowner&#39;s insurance policy does not cover a wife&#39;s negligence in not preventing her husband, who was covered by the same policy, from sexually abusing a child.  With a 4-3 decision in <a href="http://wscca.wicourts.gov/appealHistory.xsl;jsessionid=3FD5FD9B87FC5BDB14D3A673B983D3A1?caseNo=2006AP000818&cacheId=73D6249D7F582505AAF26FA750E03221&recordCount=1&offset=0&linkOnlyToForm=false&sortDirection=ASC"><u>J.G. v. Wangard</u></a> [case history; oral argument <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/supreme/scoa.jsp?docket_number=2006AP000818&begin_date=&end_date=&party_name=&sortBy=date">audio</a>], the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the <a href="http://circuitcourts.waukeshacounty.gov/">Waukesha County Circuit Court</a> [official website] that Deborah Wangard&#39;s alleged negligence was not covered by either of the couple&#39;s homeowner&#39;s policies issued by <a href="http://www.greatnortherninsuranceagency.com/">Great Northern Insurance Co.</a> [corporate website] or <a href="http://www.pacificindemnity.com/">Pacific Indemnity Insurance Co.</a> [corporate website] because her husband, Steven Wangard, caused injury through an intentional act.  The Court rejected the wife&#39;s argument that the language of the insurance contract was ambiguous and that she had a reasonable expectation of coverage. Following precedents and referring to the express language of the policy, the Court explained:<blockquote>We agree with the analysis in <u>Taryn E.F.</u> and conclude that Great Northern and Pacific&#39;s use of the phrase &quot;any covered person&quot; in the policies&#39; intentional acts exclusions, like the phrase &quot;any insured&quot; in the <u>Taryn E.F.</u> policy, unambiguously precludes coverage for all insureds.<br /><br />[T]he policies in question unambiguously state that personal injury damages &quot;arising out of&quot; the intentional acts of &quot;any covered person&quot; are excluded from coverage.  Deborah cannot reasonably argue that this policy language should be construed to cover the damages arising out of the intentional sexual contact with J.G. by her husband Steven, a covered person.  In addition, as the court of appeals recognized in <u>Jessica M.F.</u>, an insured cannot reasonably expect coverage for harms resulting from sexual assaults committed by one&#39;s spouse.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/07/16/ap5222845.html">more</a>.  <br /><br />In October 2004 Steven Wangard plead guilty to second-degree sexual assault of a child.  He admitted to having sexual contact with a minor, referred to as J.G., from 2000 to 2003 at two residences that were insured by polices from Great Northern and Pacific Indemnity insurance companies.  Steven Wangard was sentenced to five years in prison for the offense, while a <a href="http://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetails.do;jsessionid=B4C36082F9B946EDA59205B605C9A1ED.render1?caseNo=2005CV000500&countyNo=67&cacheId=FDDF58CFB01C79288FD8EAA7FFC8658E&recordCount=3&offset=1">civil lawsuit</a> [case details] against the couple in Waukesha county is set to resume in August.

Al-Bashir is facing charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities committed in the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive], but critics of the indictment say that it threatens to&nbsp;destabilize the region and poses a risk to joint AU-UN peacekeeping forces in the country. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has responded to the criticism by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7508734.stm">encouraging Sudan to comply with ICC efforts</a> [BBC report], but said that he has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27360&Cr=Darfur&Cr1=">no control over ICC indictments</a>&nbsp;[UN News Centre report]. The charges against Al-Bashir mark the first time a sitting head of state has been charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the ICC. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Monitor</font> has <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200807160188.html">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5icLZTBr0cS-XqSLT-Vs_gQu0_AQA">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Sudanese government has already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">has refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].   Hundreds of thousands of people have allegedly been killed in Darfur by Sudanese military and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2104210/">janjaweed</a> [<em>Slate</em> backgrounder] militia forces.  The investigation that resulted in Monday&#39;s charges, which involved more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, led the ICC&#39;s Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno- Ocampo to state before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221; The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a> [JURIST], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kurdish legislators staged a walkout of the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website] Tuesday, delaying a vote on a proposed provincial election bill that they say is unconstitutional. Kurdish lawmakers objected to an attached proposal that would establish a provincial council in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] to include equal numbers of Kurdish,  Arabs and Turkmeni representatives.  Kurds, who constitute the majority in the area, argue that this arrangement does not reflect the region&#39;s true population.  The parliament will reconvene to discuss the bill again on Thursday, but Kurdish legislators have threatened to boycott that session unless the council proposal is dropped. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/world/middleeast/16baghdad.html?ref=world">more</a>.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iYucl-b1PYT7xwKrwDYF9nInY4ggD91UOBK00">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February, Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected a draft provincial elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] that will lead to the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners. In March, the Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-presidency-council-withdraws.php">withdrew its objections</a> [JURIST report], indicating that the law could now take effect without any changes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday filed a <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/seattle911/library/alleged_nazi_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crm-613.html">press release</a>] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website], seeking to revoke the US citizenship of an alleged World War II Nazi militiaman.  Peter Egner, 86, is accused of taking part in the killings of over 17,000 Serbs as a member of the Nazi-run Security Police and Security Service in German-occupied Belgrade.  Egner became a US citizen in 1966 but failed to disclose his Nazi service on his citizenship application. The DOJ argued that he was ineligible for citizenship both because of his service and because he concealed that information on his application.  JTA has <a href="http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/109487.html">more</a>.  The <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em> has <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/370854_nazi16.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The DOJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/links/osi.html">Office of Special Investigations</a> (OSI) [official website] handles cases aimed at denaturalizing or deporting former Nazis who participated in wartime persecutions. Last month, Third Circuit judges <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/064406p.pdf">revoked</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-revokes-us-citizenship-of.php">report</a>] the US citizenship of Anton Geiser, an 83-year-old Pennsylvania resident who had served as an SS guard at two concentration camps before the US government mistakenly granted him a visa in 1956 and then citizenship in 1962.  In 2002, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2004/04/6th-circuit-panel-upholds-revocation.htm">revoked the US citizenship</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi concentration camp guard and Ohio resident <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST news archive] after a judge found that World War II evidence showed he worked in the Nazi concentration camps. In 2006, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/06a0034n-06.pdf">refused to overturn</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision upholding the order revoking the citizenship of former Nazi guard <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-releases-former-nazi-guard-after.php">Johann Leprich&#39;s</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian authorities arrested opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] Wednesday afternoon, less than a day after <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-authorities-issue-arrest.php">a warrant was issued for his arrest</a> on <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy allegations</a> [JURIST reports] made against him by a former aide. According to a <a href="http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2008/07/16/kenyataan-media-pejabat-dsai/">statement</a> [Anwar blog post] by a staff member, Anwar was stopped by police and taken to their headquarters while he was on his way home.  He had just spoken to the <a href="http://www.bpr.gov.my/cda/m_home/index.php">Malaysian Anti-Corruption Agency</a> [official website], where he had <a href="http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Wednesday/Frontpage/20080716103220/Article/index_html">accused</a> [<em>New Straits Times</em> report] the Malaysian Attorney General and Police Inspector-General of fabricating evidence against him. According to reports, Anwar was taken to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital to undergo DNA tests related to the investigation into the sodomy allegations.  The Malaysian news service Bernama reported that Malaysian <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/website/webdbase.nsf/w_9matrik?openForm&pid=E15A">Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=346626">gave assurances</a> [Bernama report] that Anwar would not be harmed in police custody. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gvk18e1IzUJ9V-VNzo1_wg-4mkWgD91V184G0">more</a>. From Malaysia, the <em>Star</em> has <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/16/nation/20080716101744&sec=nation">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Anwar has claimed that the sodomy allegations leveled against him are politically motivated, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June.  Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Earlier this month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Congress enacted a new <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h6331eh.txt.pdf">Medicare law</a> [HR 6331 text] on Tuesday to cut Medicare expenditures by reducing Medicare payments made to insurance companies rather than those made to doctors.  President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080715.html">vetoed</a> [text] the bill, but the Senate <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&page=S6705&position=all">overrode the veto</a> [Congressional record; <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00177">roll call</a>] by a vote of 70-26, while the House <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&page=H6521&dbname=2008_record">overrode it</a> [Congressional record; <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2008&rollnumber=491">roll call</a>] by a vote of 383-41. The law was <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/399/hr6331_highlights.pdf">designed</a> [AMA bill highlights, PDF] to benefit physicians and Medicare recipients by covering services such as mental health and preventative care, incentivizing modernization through services such as online prescriptions, limiting the ability of private fee-for-service health plans to unilaterally include physicians, and postponing a 10.6 percent Medicare pay cut to physicians for 18 months. In his veto, Bush wrote: <blockquote>I support the primary objective of this legislation, to forestall reductions in physician payments. Yet taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians is wrong.</blockquote> Both houses of Congress, as well as groups such as the <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/14332.html">American Medical Association</a> (AMA) [advocacy materials], supported the bill as a benefit to both physicians and Medicare recipients. Under the bill, the Medicare managed-care system, which subsidizes private insurance companies to provide certain medical care, will bear the costs. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ayWXgcrt0Efs&refer=us">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071501361.html?hpid=moreheadlines">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In April 2007, the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/senate-blocks-legislation-allowing.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] legislation permitting the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> [official website] or another federal government entity to intervene in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medicare">Medicare</a> [JURIST news archive] drug-pricing negotiations between drug makers and private insurance plans on behalf of beneficiaries. Advocates of the legislation argued that government involvement in drug-pricing negotiations would result in lower health care costs for the elderly and taxpayers. Opponents countered that the Medicare program was already achieving lower-than-expected drug costs for seniors through the use of private insurance companies and that the measure would have a negligible effect on federal health care expenditures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Seoul Central District Court Wednesday suspended a three-year prison sentence for former <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] Chairman and CEO <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/samsunggroup/chairman/SAMSUNGGroup_PersonalProfile.html">Kun-Hee Lee</a> [corporate profile], who was convicted of tax fraud.  The court ruled that Lee should not serve prison time because he did not actively seek to avoid taxes, but many criticized the decision in a country where wealthy corporate leaders are often seen as above the law.  In April, South Korean prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/samsung-ceo-indicted-for-alleged-tax.php">charged Lee with breach of trust and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report], but decided not to indict him based on accusations that Samsung maintained a $200 million slush fund to bribe prosecutors, judges and civil servants. Nine other Samsung executives were indicted on similar charges. Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/south-korea-prosecutors-question.php">questioned Lee</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month. AP has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/07/15/financial/f220012D09.DTL&feed=rss.business">more</a>.<br /><br />Samsung, South Korea&#39;s largest corporation, has been at the center of numerous legal battles over the past few years. In May 2007, a South Korean appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/south-korea-court-upholds-convictions.php">upheld</a> the conviction of two Samsung executives connected with <a href="/paperchase/2003/12/regulators-eye-invesco-funds-in.htm">illegal stock trading</a> [JURIST reports]. In April 2007, another Samsung executive <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/April/07_at_263.html">pleaded guilty</a> [US DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/sixth-samsung-executive-pleads-guilty.php">report</a>] to US charges of conspiring to artificially inflate the cost of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), affecting the price of personal computers worldwide. In 2005, Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/samsung-doj-reach-deal-in-price-fixing.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice to plead guilty to charges that it conspired with other technology companies to fix prices on DRAM chips.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.senado.es/">Spanish Senate</a> [official website] voted Wednesday to ratify the new <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], also known as the <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf">text</a>, PDF]. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/personal/profile/index_en.htm">Jose Manuel Barroso</a> [official profile], the president of the European Commission, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/pdf/statement_espana_20080716.pdf">congratulated Spain</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] on its passage of  the Treaty, thanking the country for its &quot;unwavering support for the European Project and the successful ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.&quot; The approval of the Lisbon Treaty by the Spanish Senate marks the final legislative hurdle for official recognition of the Treaty by Spain.  It must now be signed into law by the country&#39;s King Juan Carlos in order to be officially ratified. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7508693.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Some EU countries have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-council-to-discuss-lisbon.php">delayed ratifying the treaty</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">Irish voters rejected it</a> [JURIST reports] in June. The future of the pact is currently in doubt as it must be approved by all 27 EU states in order to take effect. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/eu-leaders-sign-reform-treaty.php">signed the reform treaty</a> [JURIST report] in December, and 14 countries had <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lisbon+treaty">ratified the document</a> [JURIST news archive] before the Irish rejection. In 2005, an earlier draft <a href="/currentawareness/euconstitution.php">European constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] also failed when voters in <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-exit-polls-say-france.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST reports] rejected the proposal in national referenda.

		<title>Massachusetts senate votes to repeal controversial 1913 marriage law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Massachusetts Senate passed a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/senate/185/st00/st00918.htm">bill</a> [SB918 text] Tuesday to repeal a 1913 law which bars people from marrying in Massachusetts if their own state would not recognize such a union.  The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/207-11.htm">statute</a> [text] gained attention because it would have the effect of preventing most out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts.  Proponents of same-sex marriage, including <a href="http://www.massequality.org/">MassEquality.org</a> [advocacy website], have applauded efforts to repeal the 1913 law, heralding the move as a step toward increased equality in the state. Other advocates of the bill highlighted the potential boost to the state&#39;s economy as a result of allowing out-of-state same-sex couples to marry in Massachusetts, pointing to potential increases in catering, hotel, and tourism revenues. The bill now goes to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which is expected to pass it. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/us/16gay.html?em&ex=1216353600&en=117761bbda5eba5c&ei=5087%0A">more</a>. The <em>Boston Globe</em> has <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/07/senate_passes_r.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-massachusetts-high-court.php">upheld the 1913 law</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.glad.org/marriage/Cote-Whitacre/CWDecision.pdf"><em>Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health</em></a> [opinion, PDF]. Opponents of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts derided the passage of SB918, characterizing it as an unwelcome intrusion into the marriage policies of other states. <a href="http://www.mafamily.org/">Massachusetts Family Institute</a> (MFI) [advocacy website] president Kris Mineau commented, &quot;The Massachusetts Senate has no right to infringe on the internal issues of how other states define marriage, but that&#39;s exactly what they voted today to do.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZmLBrL36NObNyMR0ghXN7vB5hYwD91UR8480">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canada transferred US Army deserter Robin Long back to US custody Tuesday following a decision by the <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court of Canada</a> [official website] denying his asylum request.  Long is the first of an estimated 200 US military personnel avoiding deployment in Canada to be returned to the US.  Last week the court <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2008/2008fc838/2008fc838.html#_ftn3"> allowed</a> [decision text] another soldier, Joshua Key, to remain in the country while he appeals an initial denial of refugee status.  In that case, the court named a number of key factors in determining whether or not the <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/about/index_e.htm">Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada</a> (IRB) [official website] should grant an applicant asylum, including the reasons for the objection to deployment, the likely legal consequences of resisting deployment, and the availability of remedies other than Canadian refugee status. Quoting <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf">Article 171 of the UN Refugee Agency Handbook</a> [PDF text] regarding the justification for a soldier to be granted asylum in another country, the court wrote:<blockquote>Not every conviction, genuine thought it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming refugee status after desertion or draft-evasion.  It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action.  Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.</blockquote>In Long&#39;s case, the court said he had not adequately substantiated his risk of persecution in the US were he to be denied asylum, and under Canadian law, being granted the status is the only way he could remain in the country. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</font> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080716.BCDEPORT16/TPStory/National">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/world/americas/16deport.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Canada&#39;s House of Commons voted in a non-binding resolution to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080603.wdeserters0603/BNStory/National">grant US military deserters asylum</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</font> report]. In November 2007, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/Welcome/index_e.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] declined to hear the appeals of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hinzman">Jeremy Hinzman</a> [JURIST news archive] and Brandon Hughey, two US military deserters who <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/us-soldier-seeks-asylum-in-canada.php">applied for asylum</a> [JURIST report] before the IRB. The Board had <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/decisions/public/hinzman/hinzman_e.htm">concluded</a> [decision text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/canada-denies-asylum-to-us-army-iraq.php">report</a>] that the two men would receive a fair trial if they were returned to the US and that they would not face persecution or cruel and unusual punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting <span style="font-style:italic;">en banc</span>, issued a per curiam <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/067427A.P.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] Tuesday, finding by a vote of 5-4 that if the government&#39;s allegations against <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/ali_saleh_kahlah_al_marri/index.html">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [NYT profile; Brennan Center <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/al_marri_v_pucciarelli">case materials</a>] are true, the President is empowered by Congress to hold al-Marri in a military prison without charge as an enemy combatant, under the 2001 <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF].  The ruling overturned a prior <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/067427.P.pdf">decision</a> [PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/federal-appeals-court-orders-release-of.php">report</a>] by the Fourth Circuit, which had held in 2007 that the military cannot seize and imprison civilians lawfully residing in the US and detain them as &quot;<a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatants</a>&quot; [JURIST news archive].  Ruling on a second issue Tuesday, five of the nine judges found that al-Marri&#39;s Fifth Amendment right to Due Process had been violated during the proceedings.  Circuit Judge Traxler, the only judge to vote with the majority on both determinations, outlined the 216 page opinion and distinguished the decision from that of the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certGrants/2003/hamvrum.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a> [Duke case law backgrounder; <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZS.html">opinion text</a>]:<br /><blockquote>If the allegations against al-Marri are true, al-Marri is a foreign national and member of al Qaeda who entered the United States with a purpose to commit additional hostile and war-like acts within our homeland, and he may therefore be detained as an enemy combatant under the AUMF. Accordingly, I would affirm the district court&#8217;s order denying al-Marri&#8217;s motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether the President possesses the legal authority to detain al-  Marri as an enemy combatant.  <br /><br />However, because al-Marri was present within our borders at the time our intelligence sources identified him as an enemy combatant, he is entitled to contest his designation under the burden-shifting scheme outlined in Hamdi. Under this scheme, the government may demonstrate that the balance of the competing interests weighs on the side of lessened due process protections, which al-Marri and his counsel may contest. But because the district court applied Hamdi&#8217;s lessened procedures to al-Marri without any additional inquiry or balancing of the respective interests, I would hold that the process al-Marri received was constitutionally insufficient, vacate the district court&#8217;s order dismissing al-Marri&#8217;s petition, and remand for further proceedings.</blockquote><br />Attorneys for al-Marri said that they plan to appeal to the Supreme Court the portion of the decision upholding the President&#39;s power to designate individuals seized in the US as enemy combatants.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/washington/16combatant.html?em&ex=1216353600&en=33b5c53325f43941&ei=5087%0A">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071502779.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Al-Marri was arrested at his home in Peoria, Illinois by civilian authorities in 2001, and was indicted for other crimes. In 2003, President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/23/qatar.combatant/">declared him an enemy combatant</a> [CNN report] and ordered the attorney general to transfer custody of al-Marri to the defense secretary, claiming inherent authority to hold him indefinitely.  Al-Marri has <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/enemy-combatant-detained-in-military.php">claimed abuse</a> [JURIST report] while being held in a US Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Fourth Circuit&#39;s opinion comes on the same day that lawyers for another US military detainee, <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>], <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/khadr-guantanamo-interrogation-video.php">released</a> [JURIST report] portions of a <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/video/vs?id=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715&ids=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715,RTGAM.20080710.wharper_khadr0710">video</a> [video; <a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2008/07/15/video-showing-omar-khadr-released-by-lawyers.aspx">transcript</a>] depicting a 2003 interrogation of Khadr by Canadian officials at Guantanamo Bay.  The video does not show torture, but <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/KhadrDocuments.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-documents-show-canada-knew-of-khadr.php">report</a>] released last week indicated that the Canadian government knew Khadr had been mistreated at the detention center before agents questioned him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/appdiv/index.htm">Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/a3235-a4036-06.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] two municipal ordinances that prohibited convicted sex offenders (CSOs) from living near schools, parks, playgrounds and day care centers. The Appellate Division ruled that New Jersey&#39;s statewide sex offender registry program, known as <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/appdiv/megan.htm">Megan&#39;s Law</a> [text; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5091800.stm">backgrounder</a>], preempted the local ordinances and provided the state and all municipalities with a uniform rehabilitation and public safety plan.  The court explained:<br /><blockquote>The far-reaching scope of Megan&#39;s Law and its multilayered enforcement and monitoring mechanisms constitute a comprehensive system chosen by the Legislature to protect society from the risk of reoffense by CSOs and to provide for their rehabilitation and reintegration into the community.  The system is all-encompassing regarding the activities of CSOs living in the community.  We conclude that the ordinances conflict with the expressed and implied intent of the Legislature to exclusively regulate this field, as a result of which the ordinances are preempted. </blockquote>  The court added that the ordinances, which prohibited CSOs from living within 2500 feet of a variety of locations frequented by children, had the effect of barring CSOs from upwards of two-thirds of the towns which had enacted the ordinances, and violated provisions of Megan&#39;s Law that expressly prohibited disclosing CSO information for the purposes of denying individuals housing and accommodations.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080715/D91UFNH05.html">more</a>.  <br /><br />Courts in other states have also overturned or restricted laws seeking to limit housing options for registered sex offenders. In May, the Indiana Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/05130807pdm.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indiana-appeals-court-partially.php">report</a>] a 2006 state law that prohibited sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of a school, public park, or youth center. Last November, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/pdf/s07a1043.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/georgia-high-court-throws-out-sex.php">report</a>] a state law that prohibited registered sex offenders from living within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds and other areas where children gather. Civil rights groups had criticized the <a href="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.38/t.gif">law</a> [legislative materials] as overly strict, saying that the state&#39;s roughly 11,000 registered sex offenders would have been barred from living in almost any residential area. In February 2007 a federal judge ruled that California&#39;s <a href="http://voterguide.ss.ca.gov/pdf/prop83_text.pdf">Proposition 83</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+83">news archive</a>], which prohibited California sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of any place where children regularly gather, could not be applied <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-judge-bars-retroactive.php">retroactively</a> [JURIST report] to more than 90,000 paroled sex offenders because there was nothing in the measure to indicate that intent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Belgian King <a href="http://www.monarchie.be/en/family/albert/index.html">Albert II</a> [official website] declined to accept the <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/nl/actua/persberichten/ontslag-yves-leterme">resignation</a> [press release, in Dutch] of Prime Minister <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/nl">Yves Leterme</a> [personal website, in Dutch; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/belgium-pm-submits-resignation-after.php">report</a>] on Thursday.  Leterme submitted his resignation Monday night because of his coalition government&#39;s inability to successfully divide federal powers between the Flemish- and French-speaking communities.  King Albert II also announced a commission, consisting of one German-speaking  and two French-speaking senior politicians, tasked with facilitating talks on constitutional reform. The group will report on its progress at the end of July.  AFP has <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20080718-belgium-political-crisis-king-albert-rejects-pm-resignation-yves-leterme">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7512975.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Leterme had set a deadline of July 15 for the four-month-old <a href="http://www.yvesleterme.be/sites/leterme/files/regeerakkoord.pdf">coalition</a> [founding text, PDF, in Dutch] to agree on constitutional reforms to grant increased autonomy to the two regions. Leterme said that the current <a href="http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federale_staat/">federation system of Dutch government</a> [official backgrounder] was incapable of solving the problem, since the wealthier Flemish region wanted even greater autonomy and the Francophone region maintained that the Flemish move was meant to completely separate itself from the rest of the country.

According to a <a href="http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2008/07/17/kenyataan-media-pasca-penahanan-15-julai-2008/">statement</a> [Anwar blog post] posted Thursday, Anwar was told that he would be released&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;after undergoing DNA testing, but was instead held overnight. In his statement, Anwar indicated that he has no confidence in the Malaysian criminal system, and doubted the credibility of DNA evidence, saying &quot;My accuser is still under police protection, and as such, any fabrication is possible if they take my DNA.&quot; The <em>Star</em> reports that at a Thursday afternoon press conference, Anwar <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/17/nation/20080717094352&sec=nation">demanded a copy of the police report</a> [<em>The Star</em> report] filed by his accuser, and questioned why neither he nor his lawyers had been provided with the report.

Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted.

The report included a statement from an officer with the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a branch of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.malawi.gov.mw%2FHome%2520Affairs%2FMalawi%2520Police%2520Service%2FHome%2520Police.htm&ei=cC6CSLHAGKa08wTdrLybDg&usg=AFQjCNFz3VNxYdmFpc6Sfg88cAfaqMUVpQ&sig2=a4H-0v_73VczwLN6Hzt7Cw">Malawi Police Service</a> (MPS) [official profile], who said the surveillance was normal and that it included monitoring bank accounts as well as tapping their phone lines.  The <a href=" http://www.nationmw.net/newsdetail.asp?article_id=2156">legal action</a> [Nation Online report] was <a href="http://voanews.com/english/Africa/2008-07-16-voa3.cfm">brought before the Constitutional Court</a> [VOA report] by a member of Muluzi&#39;s United Democratic Front Party (UDF), James Phiri, who is arguing that Malawi&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=7&url=http%3A%2F%2Fse2.isn.ch%2Fserviceengine%2FFileContent%3FserviceID%3D23%26fileid%3DD2EA2B50-633D-DCED-7A48-27347D3A34B1%26lng%3Den&ei=5yCCSLaQNaa08wTdrLybDg&usg=AFQjCNHxMRt2lD9VA4ZuBS4eNQxOIPhrzA&sig2=e6dXZ4Zi7UrefrkuMe2n5A">Constitution</a> [PDF text] does not allow a person to run for president if they have served for two consecutive terms.  The court is set to decide the issue on July 25.  <br /><br />Muluzi defeated president-for-life Kamuzu Banda in the country&#39;s first democratic election in 1994.  He then served as President of the nation until 2004, when he failed in an attempt to amend the country&#39;s constitution to allow him to serve for a third term.  He was able to turn over power to his hand-picked successor, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3740547.stm">President Bingu wa Mutharika</a> [BBC News profile], but Murtharika later defected from Muluzi&#39;s United Democratic Front party and formed his own party, the <a href="http://dppmw.org/">Democratic Progressive Party</a> (DPP) [official website].  The two leaders have been involved in a number of legal troubles within the country in recent years, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/former-malawi-president-arrested-on.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] which were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/corruption-charges-against-ex-malawi.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] against Muluzi in July 2006, the arrest of <a href="http://www.malawi.gov.mw/information1/CabinetProfiles/vice_president_of_the_republic_.htm">Malawi Vice President Cassim Chilumpha</a> [official profile] on charges of treason for allegedly attempting to assassinate the President in April 2006,  and <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/malawi-lawmakers-adopt-impeachment.php">impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against the President in 2005 based on allegations that he misused public funds and abused his presidential role.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] made an unusual <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/730C76BFE2C9EBA288257489007CC9E5/$file/0576841.pdf?openelement">ruling</a> [opinion text, PDF] on Friday, finding that the adverse credibility determination made by an Immigration Judge (IJ) in an asylum case was not based on substantial evidence.  The petitioner, Etagegn Haile Tekle, appealed the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [DOJ backgrounder] decision which had affirmed the IJ&#39;s denial of her case for asylum, and the Ninth Circuit granted her petition for review.  Etagegn is a citizen of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> [JURIST news archive] who applied for asylum to the US in 2004 because of a fear of arrest and torture due to her membership in the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oromoliberationfront.org%2F&ei=oQ-CSL_nLaa08wTbrLybDg&usg=AFQjCNERLvepHokwhovBa5LJr1RORDY4bg&sig2=fLO5WFua6MZuUJ_j-cfAgQ">Oromo Liberation Front</a> (OLF) [advocacy website], a political organization seeking independence for the Oromo ethnic group.  The IJ had also found that even if her testimony were truthful, she is ineligible for asylum because she has &#8220;not demonstrated severe past persecution,&#8221; and her fear of harm is due merely to &#8220;general conditions of violence and civil unrest&#8221; in Ethiopia.  In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit Court made a special effort to refute the assertions in the following statement made by the IJ on the record: <blockquote>I have one other comment, and again, I don&#8217;t care if the 9th Circuit wants to report this to my supervisor. The 9th Circuit does not comply with Supreme Court law with regard to asylum. While I am in the 9th Circuit and have to comply, I do note that they don&#8217;t really care what Immigration [J]udges do. If an Immigration [J]udge makes an adverse credibility determination, they will, in only one case out of every 250 to 300, affirm it. So I don&#8217;t play their game with regard to credibility determinations. [sic] </blockquote>The case was remanded to the BIA for additional proceedings, including a determination as to the availability of relief under the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture</a> [text].<br /><br />Ethiopian human rights practices have been strongly criticized lately.  Last month a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/ethiopia0608/ethiopia0608web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ethiopia-ethnic-separatists-targets-of.php">report</a> ] from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] detailed atrocities committed by both the Ethiopian military and the ethnic Somali group the <a href="http://www.onlf.org/">Ogaden National Liberation Front</a> (ONLF) [official website], who are seeking independence for the Ogaden region.  In October 2007, the US House of Representatives passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:2:./temp/~c110lHCyXp::">Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> (H.R. 2003) [text; JURIST Forum <a href="/forumy/2008/01/linking-rights-and-foreign-aid-for.php">article</a>], aimed in part at encouraging the human rights situation in Ethiopia, and the bill awaits a Senate vote.  In July 2007, HRW accused Ethiopian troops of <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/ethiopia-military-crackdown-on-rebels.php">violating international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report] by burning homes and forcibly relocating civilians in Ogaden. In March 2007, HRW also accused Ethiopia of complicity with the US and Kenya in <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rights-group-claims-us-involved-in.php">secretly detaining Somalis</a> [JURIST report] accused of being Islamic militants.  Ethiopia had <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/ethiopia-admits-to-detaining-terror.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 that it detained terror suspects but denied that the detentions were secret.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] announced Thursday that it has filed additional antitrust charges against microprocessor manufacturer <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a> [corporate website] for anti-competitive actions it has allegedly taken against rival <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/">Advanced Micro Devices</a> (AMD) [corporate websites]. In a Supplementary Statement of Objections (SSO), the EC said that Intel had provided &quot;substantial&quot; rebates to one computer retailer on the condition that it only use Intel processors, and that it had both paid a computer manufacturer to delay selling AMD-based devices and offered the manufacturer similar exclusivity rebates. The EC <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/517&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">announced</a> [press release] that Intel has eight weeks to respond to the complaint:<blockquote>Each of the conducts outlined in the 26 July 2007 Statement of Objections and the SSO is provisionally considered to constitute an abuse of a dominant position in its own right. However, the Commission also considers at this stage of its analysis that all the types of conduct reinforce each other and are part of a single overall anti-competitive strategy aimed at excluding AMD or limiting its access to the market.</blockquote>In both the original <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/07/314&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">July 2007 Statement of Objections</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/eu-accuses-intel-of-antitrust.php">report</a>] and recent&nbsp;supplement, the EC&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/index_en.htm">Directorate General for Competition</a> [official website] &nbsp;alleges that Intel violated&nbsp;the Treaty of Rome&#39;s <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/art82/index.html">antitrust prohibitions</a> [Article 82 backgrounder] by providing the large rebates to several computer manufacturers and retailers in order to push AMD out of the market. In a response to the complaint, Intel has <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20080717corp_a.htm?iid=pr1_releasepri_20080717ra"> denied that the rebates were designed to inhibit competition</a> [press release]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g6GOmPS9hJa0gSdvS613gEUigymgD91VSFP01">more</a>.<br /><br />Intel has recently been charged with a number of anti-competition violations around the world, with the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ftc-opens-intel-antitrust-probe.php">most recent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into its practices being initiated by the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">US Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website] in June. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.ftc.go.kr/eng/">Korean Fair Trade Commission</a> (KFTC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/intel-fined-25-million-for-antitrust.php">levied nearly $26 million in fines</a> [JURIST report] against Intel after a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/south-korea-concludes-probe-into-intel.php">KFTC probe</a> [JURIST report] found that the company had engaged in anti-competitive practices.&nbsp;In January, the state of <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/new-york-opens-investigation-into.php">New York opened an antitrust probe</a> [JURIST report] into Intel&#39;s actions and AMD has also <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/computer-chip-maker-amd-sues-intel-for.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD-Intel_Full_Complaint.pdf">civil suit</a> [complaint, PDF; Intel <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050901corp.htm">response</a>] against the company.

National security force officer Souhail Guezdah was sentenced to to nine years in prison, while deputy prison head Sami Belhaj Aissa received a four-year sentence. Three others received sentences ranging between four and nine years. The proceedings echoed the internationally-publicized <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1DE113BF93BA1575AC0A961948260">1987 trial</a> [<em>New York Times</em> report] of dozens of Muslim fundamentalists accused of attempting to overthrow the Tunisian government using terrorist tactics.  A defense lawyer promised to appeal the convictions, noting that about 1,000 people have been charged or sentenced under a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE30/021/2003/en/dom-MDE300212003en.html">2003 anti-terror law</a> [Amnesty backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Serbian prosecutors confirmed on Friday that they are gathering evidence for a case against an alleged World War II Nazi guard currently living in the United States.  Peter Egner, 86, has admitted to serving in the Nazi-run Security Police and Security Service, a unit which is believed to have taken part in the killings of over 17,000 people in the area surrounding German-occupied Belgrade.  On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a <a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/seattle911/library/alleged_nazi_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-continues-efforts.php">report</a>] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website], seeking to revoke Egner&#39;s US citizenship.  Egner became a US citizen in 1966 but failed to disclose his Nazi service on his citizenship application. The DOJ argued that he was ineligible for citizenship both because of his service and because he concealed that information on his application.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080718/D92075600.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Also Friday, the Spanish National Court granted a <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/spain-should-extradite-ex-nazi-officers.php">petition</a>  [JURIST report] by rights group <a href="http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/eng.html">Equipo Nizkor</a> [advocacy website] to hear a case against four former Nazi officers for alleged war crimes committed during World War II. The suit was brought on behalf of a concentration camp survivor and families of three who died at the camp. Under Spanish law, the country&#39;s courts can exercise <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/ij0606/">universal jurisdiction</a> [HRW backgrounder] to try those suspected of genocide and other serious human rights offenses even if they occur abroad. The four named in the suit, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2003/July/03_crm_399.htm">Johann Leprich</a> [DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-releases-former-nazi-guard-after.php">report</a>], <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/06/29/national/main210834.shtml">Anton Tittjung</a> [AP report], <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pr/press_releases/2008/06/06-16-08kumpf.pdf">Josias Kumpf</a> [DOJ press release] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=John+Demjanjuk">John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST news archive], are currently in the US under deportation orders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former&nbsp;US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ashcroft-bio.html">Attorney General John Ashcroft</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=206456-1">testified</a> [C-Span video, flash; <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Ashcroft080717.pdf">prepared statement</a>, PDF] before the<a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/"> House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] Thursday, defending advice the Department of Justice (DOJ) gave the Bush administration on the legality of certain interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects.  Ashcroft had been called before the committee to testify on his involvement with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/cheney/torture_memo_aug2002.pdf">2002</a> and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/yoo_army_torture_memo.pdf">2003</a> [PDF texts; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-memo-advised-military-that.php">report</a>] so-called &quot;torture memos&quot; provided to the White House by the DOJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a>&nbsp;(OLC) [official website].  Ashcroft said that the original rules adopted by the administration were too broad, but that they were later revised and were never intended as a way to circumvent constitutional or legal protections:<blockquote>The Administration&#8217;s continual&#8212; indeed, almost obsessive&#8212;quest for legal guidance and specific authorization for measures necessitated by the War on Terror is evidence of a government striving to keep within the limits of law, not one seeking to ignore or evade those limits.  I make no claim that the Department&#8217;s analyses of the difficult legal questions that arose during my tenure as Attorney General&#8212; questions often at the edges of our law&#8212;were always flawless, nor that our conclusions were always free from doubt.  No Administration can lay claim to such a feat; nor can the oft-divided Supreme Court, which reverses itself, from time to time, on issues of the greatest national importance.  I can and do claim, however, that as Attorney General I sought to ensure that the legal advice provided by the Department adhered to the highest professional standards of quality and integrity.</blockquote>Ashcroft said that even in the face of national security demands, torture would not be justified and that to his knowledge had not been employed against the suspects. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gU8zksMiPDF25P3iVXU_3QVt9-yQD91VODC80">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/17/ST2008071702663.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Both Ashcroft and others who have testified before the Committee have stressed that the OLC only gave the White House legal advice, but did not determine policy. In June, Vice Presidential chief of staff <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29addington.htm">David Addington</a> [<em>US News</em> profile] and former DOJ lawyer <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/y/john_c_yoo/index.html?inline=nyt-per">John Yoo</a> [<em>New York Times</em> profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ashcroft-involved-with-torture-memos.php">testified before the same committee</a> [JURIST report], saying that Ashcroft was aware of the memoranda when they were written. The Committee had threatened to compel <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-house-panel-threatens-to-subpoena.php">Ashcroft</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/house-panel-votes-to-subpoena-cheney.php">others</a> [JURIST reports] to testify on the memos earlier this year, but Ashcroft later volunteered to appear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Berlusconi">news archive</a>] on Thursday was denied his request to replace the presiding judge at his ongoing <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/italy-corruption-trial-of-ex-pm.php">corruption trial</a> [JURIST report].  Berlusconi&#39;s legal team <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-07-17_117229703.html">claimed</a> [ANSA report] that judge Nicoletta Gandus was biased after she commented on laws passed by the previous Berlusconi government. They also argued that she had a vested interest in another trial involving Berlusconi because she previously owned shares of Berlusconi&#39;s broadcasting company, <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/home_en.shtml">Mediaset</a> [corporate website]. Berlusconi faces charges of corruption arising from his alleged payment of $600,000 to his former lawyer David Mills for favorable testimony at trials in the 1990s.  DPA has <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/219597,berlusconi-fails-in-attempt-to-remove-judge-in-corruption-trial.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Gandus <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-judge-says-berlusconi-corruption.php">said that hearings in the case would continue</a> [JURIST report] despite the request for her removal.  Also last month, Berlusconi suggested that <a href="http://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/dossier/studi/2008/Dossier_014.pdf">proposed changes to Italian law</a> [PDF text, in Italian] designed to suspend older trials for nonviolent crimes would <a href="http://www.governo.it/Notizie/Palazzo%20Chigi/testo_int.asp?d=39287">allow the country&#39;s judiciary to consider more important cases</a> [Senate letter, in Italian] and would give the government time to introduce judicial reforms. The changes would protect high-ranking government officials from prosecution during their terms in office. Critics of the proposal have charged that the move is personally motivated since Berlusconi&#39;s trial would be among those suspended. Berlusconi has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">embezzlement, false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports] involving Mediaset.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said Thursday that he will widen his investigation into war crimes in Sudan&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive] to include attacks by rebel groups against <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] peacekeeping forces. Speaking at a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27407&Cr=Darfur&Cr1=">press conference</a> [UN News report] during celebrations for the tenth anniversary of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF text], which created the ICC, Moreno-Ocampo said, &quot;Any attack against peacekeepers is a crime under my jurisdiction.&quot; Moreno-Ocampo also indicated that his office is reviewing evidence related to such incidents, and now knows the identity of two rebel commanders who initiated the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/world/africa/02darfur.html">September 2007 attack on AU peacekeepers</a> [NYT report] in the Darfur town of Haskanita.

BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7513378.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />On Monday, Moreno-Ocampo applied for an <a href="ICC Chief Prosecutor considering additional Sudan case against Darfur rebels ">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities committed in Darfur. The Sudanese government has already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">has refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].   Hundreds of thousands of people have allegedly been killed in Darfur by Sudanese military and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2104210/">janjaweed</a> [<em>Slate</em> backgrounder] militia forces.  The investigation that resulted in Monday&#39;s charges, which involved more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, led Moreno-Ocampo to state before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221; The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a>, but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST reports] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US district court judge on Thursday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1519-108">rejected a bid</a> [PDF text] to stay the trial of Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>], ruling that a civilian court should refrain from review until the military commission had issued a &quot;final judgment.&quot;  Hamdan&#39;s lawyers had <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hamdan-prel-inj-motion-7-3-08.pdf">argued</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hamdan-legal-memo-7-3-08.pdf">memorandum</a>, PDF] that the military trial should be postponed until the court rules on the jurisdiction and legality of Hamdan&#39;s military commission, but the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-calls-for-hamdan.php">responded</a>  [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] only gave detainees the right to challenge their detention, not to challenge their trials once they became defendants.  In his written opinion released on Friday, Judge James Robertson explained:<blockquote>Hamdan&#39;s focus now is not on post-trial <em>habeas</em>, of course. What he seeks is pre-trial relief to avoid being subjected to a trial that, in his submission, will be unlawful. His claims of unlawfulness, however, are all claims that should or must be decided in the first instance by the Military Commission, and then raised before the DC Circuit, as necessary, on appeal. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <u>Councilman</u> requires federal courts to give &quot;due respect to the autonomous military judicial system created by Congress.&quot; <u>Councilman</u> involved courtmartial proceedings against a US service member, to be sure, and not a military commission, but its central rationale is applicable here. <u>Councilman</u> requires the courts to respect the balance that Congress has struck in creating a military justice system, &quot;a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion.&quot; [citations omitted]</blockquote>Robertson also relied on the DC Circuit Court of Appeal&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-khadr.php">recent ruling</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200806/07-1405-1122663.pdf">Khadr v. United States</a> [PDF text], where it was held that pursuant to the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ366.109.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF], all challenges raised to a military commission trial can be only be addressed after a final judgment is rendered.  Hamdan&#39;s trial, the first war crimes trial at Guantanamo Bay, is set to begin Monday.  AP has <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GUANTANAMO_BIN_LADENS_DRIVER?SITE=MAFAL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this week, a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial has the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the case.  The judge <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/07/16/18/Expostfacto.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">rejected</a> [ruling, PDF] Hamdan&#39;s <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Feb2008/d20080207hamdenmotions.pdf">argument</a> [motions, PDF] that because the charges of conspiracy and providing material support did not exist at the time Hamdan allegedly committed them, they violated the <span style="font-style:italic;">ex post facto</span> clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html#section9">US Constitution</a> and Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/AP-Guantanamo-Geneva-Conventions.html">Geneva Convention</a> [texts], and therefore could not be applied retroactively.  The judge deferred to Congress&#39; express declaration, made when passing the MCA, that it did not create &quot;new crimes that did not exist before its enactment.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Bush administration abandoned plans to impose <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85.html">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [text] regulations on power plants and other stationary pollution sources after opposition from the oil industry, according to a <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/tools/2q08materials/files/0110.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/mediacenter/pressreleases_2008?id=0022#main_content">press release</a>] released Friday by the <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/">House Select Committee on Global Warming</a> [official website]. Based on <a href="http://globalwarming.house.gov/mediacenter/pressreleases_2008?id=0022#main_content">interviews</a> [transcript, PDF] with former EPA official Jason Burnett, the committee found that there was early widespread support within both the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] and the Bush administration for extending the scope of existing environmental regulations, but that the White House reversed its approach after lobbying by oil companies:<blockquote>The oil industry argued against regulatory action, and had the support of the Office of Vice President Cheney. In developing its proposals to make a positive endangerment finding and to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions from both vehicles and stationary sources, EPA consulted with a wide range of environmental and industry stakeholders. Environmental stakeholders and, interestingly, some electric utility representatives, including the Edison Electric Institute (which represents the nation&#39;s major investor-owned utilities), agreed that it would be best for EPA to proceed with regulation of both vehicles and stationary sources using Clean Air Act authority. But others, including oil industry representatives from ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute, and the National Petrochemicals and Refiners Association, adopted a &quot;not on my watch&quot; approach &#8211; arguing that such regulations would tarnish President Bush&#39;s conservative anti-regulatory legacy, and should be delayed until the next President took office. Those arguments were echoed, within the White House, by Vice President Cheney&#39;s energy adviser, F. Chase Hutto III. <br /><br />Doing the oil industry&#39;s bidding, the Bush administration reversed course. After passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act in 2007, the arguments put forward by the oil industry representatives began to prevail in inter-agency and White House discussions on how to respond to the <u>Massachusetts v. EPA</u> decision. By March 2008, EPA announced that, instead of issuing proposals for a positive endangerment finding and regulations, it would move forward with a non-regulatory &quot;Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&quot; (ANPR). By mid-April 2008, President Bush announced in a speech that &quot;the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act were never meant to regulate global climate change,&quot; and went on to assert that Congress, not the Executive Branch, was responsible for deciding how to address greenhouse gas emissions.</blockquote>According to Burnett, the White House first instructed the EPA to begin preparing a greenhouse gas regulation plan in November 2007.  In December, after the EPA had submitted its findings to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the administration ordered it to retract the report.  <a href="http://www.epa.gov/adminweb/administrator/biography.htm">EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson</a> [official profile] reportedly refused to do so, and the OMB refused to review the EPA&#39;s report.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/more-on-why-white-house-blocked-co2-curbs/index.html?hp">more</a>.<br /><br />The move to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA began after the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2006/masvenv.html">Massachusetts v. EPA</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in_29.php">report</a>] that the EPA has the authority under the Act to regulate automobiles&#39; emission of &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; such as carbon dioxide.  In April, 17 states filed a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Cago/docs/press/2008_04_02_epa_petition.pdf">petition</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=pressreleases&agId=Cago&prModName=cagopressrelease&prFile=2008_04_02_epa_petition.xml">press release</a>] in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit seeking to compel the EPA to comply with the Supreme Court ruling. The plaintiffs alleged that the EPA had failed to issue any regulations for greenhouse gases and asked the court to order the agency to take action within 60 days.  During March <a href="http://appropriations.senate.gov/Hearings/2008_03_04_-Interior-_Testimony_of_EPA_Administrator_Stephen_Johnson_at_March_4_Interior_Subcommittee_Hearing.pdf?CFID=1221686&CFTOKEN=19477555">testimony</a> [statement, PDF] before the <a href="http://appropriations.senate.gov/index.cfm">Senate Appropriations Committee</a> [official website], Stephen L. Johnson <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/epa-head-says-no-timeline-on-supreme.php">refused to disclose a timeline</a> [JURIST report] for the agency&#39;s compliance with the Supreme Court ruling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Texas Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] said Thursday that Texas will go forward with the August 5 execution of a Mexican national despite an <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] order <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/139/14637.pdf?PHPSESSID=39cdd63a2169a8c75c02f57dcf6db222">staying the execution</a> [order and press release, PDF].  The ICJ ordered Wednesday that a mandated review be conducted to determine whether five Mexican nationals on death row in Texas were inappropriately denied the chance to speak with Mexican counselor officers in violation of the 1963 <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [PDF text].  The court held: <blockquote>The United States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that Jose Ernesto Medellin Rojas, Cesar Roberto Fierro Reyna, Ruben Ramirez Cardenas, Humberto Leal Garcia, and Roberto Moreno Ramos are not executed pending judgment on the Request for interpretation submitted by the United Mexican States, unless and until these five Mexican nationals receive review and reconsideration consistent with paragraphs 138 to 141 of the Court&#39;s Judgment delivered  on 31 March 2004 in the case concerning <u>Avena and Other Mexican Nationals</u> (<u>Mexico v. United States of America</u>).</blockquote>  <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights/2005/05/insights050531.html">Jose Medellin</a> [ASIL backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medellin">news archive</a>], <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/texas-judge-sets-execution-date-for.php">had been scheduled to be executed</a> [JURIST report] by the State of Texas on August 5. In its order, the ICJ explicitly stated: <blockquote>Texas has made clear that unless restrained, it will go forward with the execution without providing Mr. Medellin the mandated review and reconsideration and that such action by the Texas courts will thereby irreparably breach the United States obligations under the <u>Avena</u> judgment.</blockquote>  <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5890690.html">Commenting on the order</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Houston Chronicle</span> report], Governor Perry&#39;s office stated:<blockquote>The world court [ICJ] has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court. It is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties.  It&#39;s very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens.</blockquote>The court said it will decide whether the US was under an obligation to grant the defendants access to the counselors, and ordered the US to report the actions it takes to comply with the order.  AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080716/wl_afp/icjmexicousexecutionruling_080716182646">more</a>.<br /> <br />In March, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a 2005 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050228-18.html">memorandum</a> [text] from President George W. Bush ordering states not to carry out the executions was invalid because he did not have the authority to direct state courts to comply with the ICJ&#39;s <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&k=11&case=128">earlier order</a> [ICJ materials].  Medellin was sentenced to death for raping and murdering two teenage girls in 1993.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The California Supreme Court Wednesday <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/actions/SL071608.PDF">rejected</a> [conference actions list, PDF] without comment a <a href="http://data.lambdalegal.org/in-court/downloads/bennett_ca_b_20080620_writ-petiton-memorandum-points-and-authorities.pdf">challenge</a>  [petition, PDF] seeking to remove a November ballot initiative that would ban same-sex marriage in the state.  The petition, filed by <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=4026385">Equality California</a>, the <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a>, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites], argued that the amendment would deprive same-sex couples of fundamental rights.  If approved by voters, the <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf">California Marriage Protection Act</a> [ballot materials, PDF; <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/index.php">proposition website</a>] would amend the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">state constitution</a> [text] to read, &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.&quot;  The ballot initiative comes in reaction to a May 15 California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">report</a>] overturning a ban on same-sex marriage in the state.  The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/16/BAL911Q6RA.DTL&feed=rss.">more</a>.<br /><br />The approval of the ballot initiative came after the Attorneys General of ten states submitted a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/ags-from-10-states-seek-stay-of.php">brief</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website], asking it to stay its decision until after the November elections. They asserted that allowing same-sex marriages would cause citizens in their own states to become &quot;marriage tourists&quot; in California, and their own state courts would then face unfair, extensive, and burdensome litigation on whether to recognize the marriages. A conservative advocacy group filed a similar <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/conservative-group-petitions-california.php">petition</a> [JURIST report] requesting a stay until November. In May, the California <a href="http://ww2.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/birthdeathmar/Pages/default.aspx">Office of Vital Records</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-to-begin-issuing-same-sex.php">memorandum</a> [JURIST report] setting June 17 as the start day for issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The court&#39;s May 15 decision stemmed from San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom&#39;s 2004 decision to <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/first-us-gay-marriage-performed-in-san.htm">issue marriage licenses to 4,000 same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Swedish legal organization Monday filed a <a href="http://www.centrumforrattvisa.se/images/File/FRA/FRA_ECHR_080714.pdf">complaint</a>  [PDF text] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website], challenging a controversial <a href="http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/8670/a/78367">warrantless wiretapping law</a> [draft text, in Swedish] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sweden-approves-wiretapping-bill.php">passed</a>  [JURIST report] by the Swedish parliament last month.  The law gives Sweden&#39;s <a href="http://www.fra.se/english.shtml">National Defence Radio Establishment</a> [official website] broad authority to monitor international telephone and electronic communications passing through the country.  The <a href="http://www.centrumforrattvisa.se/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/23/">Centrum f&ouml;r R&auml;ttvisa</a> (CFR) [advocacy website] argues that the law could violate the right to privacy enshrined in Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/Eur_Convention/euroconv.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], noting that the ECHR has recently <a href="http://www.centrumforrattvisa.se/images/File/FRA/LibertyvUK.pdf">struck down</a> [ECHR judgment, PDF] a similar UK eavesdropping law.<br /><br />The Swedish law, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sweden-parliament-votes-against.php">initially rejected by parliament</a> [JURIST report], passed by a narrow 143-138 margin after last-minute changes made by lawmakers.  The changes included a provision for independent oversight of the program, but critics say the law still does not do enough to protect privacy interests.  Opposition party members say the program could also be <a href="http://mp.se/templates/Mct_78.aspx?avdnr=12575&number=152238">used to intercept domestic communications</a> [press release, in Swedish], and the International Federation of Journalists argued it could <a href="http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/efj-condemns-surveillance-law-in-sweden">compromise source anonymity</a> [press release]. Millions of Swedish citizens have filed <a href="http://blogg.expressen.se/thomasmattsson/entry.jsp?messid=390294">electronic petitions</a> [sample petitions, in Swedish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sweden-wiretapping-law-opposed-by.php">report</a>] against the law, which will take effect in January 2009.

The court confirmed that the free speech rights of military personnel were more limited than those of civilians because they had to be balanced against military policy and readiness, but found that statements made by Pfc. Jeremy T. Wilcox were not actionable because they did not interfere with his job performance or with any military mission:<blockquote>There is no evidence that any of Appellant&#8217;s statements were directed at military members or ever reached his unit. And it is pure speculation that the racist views propounded on the Internet by a single person purporting to be a paratrooper either were viewed or would be viewed by other servicemembers or would be perceived by the public or a servicemember as an expression of Army or military policy.</blockquote>Military prosecutors charged Wilcox with making statements that discredited the Armed Forces and were contrary to discipline based on white supremacist beliefs expressed in his AOL profile. <br /><br />At his initial court martial, Wilcox was sentenced to eight months confinement and a bad-conduct discharge.  Tuesday&#39;s decision overturned that verdict and remanded the case to the <a href="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/acca">US Army Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website].

Italian leaders have pushed to require all Italian citizens and resident foreigners to be fingerprinted for national ID cards. The move is seen by some as an attempt to deflect accusations of &quot;<a href="http://euobserver.com/22/26408">ethnic cataloguing</a>&quot; [EUobserver report] for efforts to fingerprint the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> [JURIST news archive].

That fingerprinting scheme, announced last month by <a href="http://www.oecd.org/speaker/0,3438,en_21571361_34360727_34508996_1_1_1_1,00.html">Interior Minister Roberto Maroni</a> [OECD profile], involves recording the fingerprints of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging.   Vincenzo Spadafora, head of <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/italy.html">UNICEF in Italy</a> [official website], had said UNICEF was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the proposal, commenting that &quot;If this is being brought in to protect the rights of Roma children, Italian children should also be fingerprinted to protect them as well.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/biography.html">President George W. Bush</a> [official profile] invoked executive privilege Wednesday to prevent members of the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official website] from obtaining an FBI report&nbsp;on an interview with Vice President Dick Cheney&nbsp;concerning the <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Committee had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-house-committee-subpoenas-cia-leak.php">subpoenaed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael Mukasey</a> [official profile] in late June, attempting to gain access to the documents. The assertion of executive privilege by President Bush came in a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20080716104053.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Committee Chairman <a href="http://www.henrywaxman.house.gov/">Rep. Henry Waxman</a> (D-CA) [official website]. The letter to Rep. Waxman also contained a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20080716104027.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] from Mukasey to President Bush outlining the legal justification for invoking the privilege.  In that letter, Mukasey wrote: <blockquote>Much of the content of the subpoenaed documents falls squarely within the presidential communications and deliberative process components of executive privilege. Several of the subpoenaed interview reports summarize conversations between you and your advisors, which are direct presidential communications. Other portions of the documents fall within the scope of the presidential communications component of the privilege because they summarize deliberations among your most senior advisers in the course of preparing information or advice for presentation to you, including information related to the preparation of your 2003 State of the Union Address and possible responses to public assertions that the address contained an inaccurate statement. In addition, many of the documents summarize deliberations among senior White House officials about how to respond to media inquiries concerning the 2003 State of the Union Address and Ambassador Wilson&#39;s trip to Niger. Such internal deliberations among White House staff clearly fall within the scope of the deliberative process component of the privilege. As the Supreme Court explained, &quot;human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.&quot;</blockquote>Rep. Waxman responded to the President&#39;s assertion of executive privilege in an <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20080716101908.pdf">opening statement</a> [text, PDF] to a meeting on a possible contempt order against Mukasey, calling the assertion &quot;ludicrous,&quot; and replying: <blockquote>This unfounded assertion of executive privilege does not protect a principle; it protects a person. The President is wrong to shield Vice President Cheney from scrutiny. In our system of government, even the Vice President should be accountable for his action.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hOVmnMwLkjokxPMSuDKwFkmUNGMgD91V6UK00">more</a>. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/16/AR2008071601786.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The June subpoena was the latest of several attempts by legislative bodies to obtain documents and testimony related to these investigations. In May, the Committee voted to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/house-panel-votes-to-subpoena-cheney.php">issue a subpoena</a> [JURIST report]  to compel Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s chief of staff <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060529/29addington.htm">David Addington</a> [US News profile] to testify about a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/yoo_army_torture_memo.pdf">memorandum</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/doj-memo-advised-military-that.php">report</a>]  authorizing a wide range of interrogation methods to be used against suspected terrorists. In January, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20071203103022.pdf">sought transcripts</a> [letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-house-panel-asks-mukasey-to-obtain.php">report</a>] of the interviews conducted with the CIA leak investigation, but was unsuccessful in obtaining them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile] wrote in a <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/r0/download/1330518%7Eac9e421e02d7f4fb5de858f3fa4515ac/CuomoComcast.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] Monday that his office would bring legal action within five days against <a href="http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/About/Corporateinfo/Corporateinfo.html?lid=1AboutCorporateInfo&pos=Nav">Comcast Cable Communications</a> [corporate website] unless the company agrees to block child pornography websites and strengthen its reporting requirements. Verizon, Time Warner Cable, and Sprint <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/june/june10a_08.html">agreed to block access to the sites</a> in June, promising to eliminate any such sites hosted on their servers under Cuomos&#39;s so-called &quot;Code of Conduct.&quot; Earlier this month,  AT&amp;T and AOL <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/july/july10a_08.html">signed similar agreements</a> [press releases]. Last week, Comcast agreed to different&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncta.com/ReleaseType/MediaRelease/Historic-Agreement-Will-Strengthen-the-Fight-Against-Child-Pornography.aspx">terms</a> [press release] to limit the spread of online child pornography, but Cuomo said that they were too weak and criticized Comcast for its refusal to sign his agreement: <blockquote>Because the possession or distribution of child pornography is both a federal and state felony, it is not protected by the first amendment. I have crafted the Code of Conduct each of these companies has signed as narrowly as possible to ensure that the actions they volunteer to take are surgically directed at only that felonious material and not at any protected content. Despite both the groundswell of corporate concern and action to reduce the supply of child pornography and the narrowly tailored provisions of the Code of Conduct, Comcast has remained on the sidelines.</blockquote> Comcast officials have said they will likely sign an agreement with Cuomo on the issue. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</font> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121669155788072477.html?mod=googlenews_wsj%3Cspan%20style=">more</a>.

Martin has also pressured Comcast to adopt <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-266254A1.pdf">a la carte cable programming</a> [report, PDF] to give consumers more choices, and he has pushed for more general legal and business transparency from the cable company.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thai and Cambodian officials agreed Monday that neither country will use military force against the other in their dispute over the border area surrounding the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/asia/thailand/730106/%27Preah-Vihear-has-the-most-breathtaking-location%27.html">Preah Vihear temple</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> backgrounder], over which both countries claim ownership. The meeting was designed to resolve the major border dispute issues, but the sides made no further agreements because Thai officials <a href="http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=5349">want to employ US cartography</a> [TNA report], while Cambodian officials want French materials to be controlling because they mark the border at a different place. <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (ASEAN) [official website] Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/21792.htm">said</a> [statement text] of the meeting: <blockquote>Thailand and Cambodia gave the assurance that they would exercise utmost restraint and resolve the issue amicably in the spirit of ASEAN solidarity and good neighbourliness. Both sides also reiterated that they would handle the situation in accordance with their ASEAN and international obligations.</blockquote> Both countries will keep troops at the border, and talks have been suspended until after the Cambodian general elections scheduled for later this month.

The <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangkok Post</span> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/220708_News/22Jul2008_news001.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Tensions have long existed between Thailand and Cambodia concerning the Preah Vihear temple, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4871.pdf">decided</a> [opinion, PDF] in 1962 that it was located in Cambodia. In early July of this year, the <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29008&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html">UN Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) [official website] approved a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/fr/actualites/451">Cambodian application</a> [UNESCO press release, in French] for recognition of the temple as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Two weeks ago, Thailand&#39;s <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Thai] ruled that current prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] violated the country&#39;s constitution by <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-support-for-cambodia-heritage.php">dropping Thai claims</a> [JURIST report] to the temple without parliamentary approval. Opponents of the temple transfer have called for those involved to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">impeached and charged with treason</a> [JURIST report], while others have called for the government to <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=128859">rescind its recognition of the bid</a> or <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/140708_News/14Jul2008_news13.php">join in the multinational force</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> reports] that will guard the site. Cambodia has sent <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/cambodia-alerts-un-security-council-to.php">sent a letter to the UN</a> [JURIST report] seeking to draw attention to the border dispute.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Navy Capt. Keith Allred, the judge presiding over the military commission trial of <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>], <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/07/21/18/suppress-D-029_and_D-044_Ruling.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Monday that Hamdan is not entitled to the protection against self-incrimination under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5afrag1_user.html#amdt5a_hd4">Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution</a> [text]. In the same order, Allred also barred evidence obtained in Afghanistan immediately after Hamdan&#39;s capture there in 2001 because of the &quot;highly coercive&quot; conditions of his detention. Hamdan pleaded not guilty to <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d2007Hamdan%20-%20Notification%20of%20Sworn%20Charges.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet] of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism at the beginning of the trial Monday at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hamdan is the first so-called &quot;enemy combatant&quot; to be tried by a military commission at Guantanamo. Ruling against Hamdan&#39;s right to protection under the Fifth Amendment, Allred wrote:<blockquote>In summary, the commission finds that (1) the accused has been found to be an unlawful enemy combatant by a full, fair, open and adversarial hearing; (2) that the site of his apprehension and detention, in the Court&#39;s own words &quot;is a factor that weighs against a finding that he has rights under the [Constitution]&quot;; (3) there are substantial practical arguments against applying the 5th Amendment &quot;with full force and effect&quot; in Guantanamo Bay; (4) that the alternative remedy Congress has provided, is considerably less protective than the 5th Amendment but is consistent with the minimal protections guaranteed to unlawful combatants under Common Article 3; (5) that there is no necessity for the 5th Amendment to prevent injustice, and (6) that application of the 5th Amendment in Guantanamo Bay would be anomalous in some respects. The preponderance of these factors analyzed weigh against the application of the 5th Amendment in Guantanamo Bay. The Supreme Court has expressly disclaimed extraterritorial application of the 5th Amendment as recently as 1990 &quot;The claim that extraterritorial aliens are entitled to rights under the 5th Amendment has been emphatically rejected.&quot;[citation omitted]</blockquote> The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/washington/22detain.html">more</a>. The <em>Miami Herald</em> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/613011.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last week, a judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-delay-hamdan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by Hamdan&#39;s lawyers to stay his trial, ruling that a civilian court should refrain from reviewing the case until the military commission issues a final judgment. Earlier last week, Allred <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001 when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until this month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French parliament voted to amend the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/connaissance/constitution.asp">French Constitution</a> [text] on Monday, passing the amendment package by the necessary three-fifths vote of legislators from both the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> and <a href="http://www.senat.fr/">Senate</a> [official websites, in French].  The <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/congres2/texte_adopte_congres_210708.pdf">amendments</a> [draft bill, PDF, in French] would allow the French president to address the parliament, sets a two-term limit for the presidency, provides for a parliamentary veto of certain presidential appointments, allows parliament to set its own agenda, and ends the president&#39;s right of collective pardon. French president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nicolas+sarkozy">news archive</a>] is in Ireland seeking a solution to the failed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive] referendum, but voiced his approval of the parliament&#39;s vote.  AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jHmDUT3E4BVX3ELukz9Psh2AM_9w">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7517505.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The constitutional amendment package was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/french-senate-passes-sarkozy.php">approved in the Senate last week</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 162-125. The amendments are aimed at strengthening the powers of the National Assembly and Senate by giving them more oversight authority.  The reforms will restrain the executive branch through the use of term limits and other provisions. The amendment package is generally favored by parties with more conservative and centrist platforms, but liberals have <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/07/17/les-gages-donnes-par-nicolas-sarkozy-laissent-de-marbre-les-socialistes_1074396_823448.html#ens_id=1031893">called the package a &quot;sham&quot;</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Le Monde</span> report, in French]. They have said that it will be ineffective at instituting desirable changes and that it will serve to bolster Sarkozy&#39;s powers.

Previously, illegal immigrants could be sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 months to six years, but under the new legislation violators can be fined between $500 and $2,400 US.

Rights activists also hope the legislation will send a positive message to the US Congress about how Mexico treats immigrants within its own borders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Council of Europe <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile] released a report on Monday emphasizing the need for European governments to critically examine their human rights records and patterns of discrimination.  The report, entitled <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Viewpoints/publication_EN.pdf">&quot;Human Rights in Europe: no grounds for complacency&quot;</a> [PDF, text; <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Viewpoints/Default_en.asp">press release</a>] highlights a number of rights issues which have been heavily covered by the media in recent months, including anti-Semitism, racism, and torture.  Hammarberg also focused on persecution of the Roma ethnic minority, and late on Monday Italian Interior Minister Roberto Moroni announced that children in Roma camps <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-07-21_121231982.html">will be granted &quot;humanitarian&quot; citizenship</a> [ANSA report].  In his forward, Hammerberg wrote:<blockquote>Some governments in western Europe have tended to see human rights as a foreign policy issue. This has often placed the mandate under the Ministry for Foreign Affairs &#8211; implying problems in this field could only be found in other countries. They have ratified international treaties as an act of good will, rather than recognising that these norms are relevant and useful in their own country, too. They have reacted with surprise when criticised European and international human rights mechanisms and sometimes in response even attempted to undermine these very mechanisms.</blockquote> The Commissioner&#39;s report also cautioned against human rights violations in the name of combating terrorism, and called on European countries to secure the independence of the judiciary and protect their justice systems from corruption.<br /><br />Hammarberg has been a critic of recent controversial measures taken by European governments.  Last week, Hammarberg <a href="/hotline/2008/07/italys-personal-data-collection-on-roma.php">questioned</a> [JURIST Hotline commentary] the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma+fingerprinting">fingerprinting</a> [JURIST news archive] of Italy&#39;s Roma minority, calling for assurances that the controversial scheme conformed to international norms. In a June interview with BBC Radio 4, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/eu-rights-commissioner-warns-uk-42-day.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the UK&#39;s proposed anti-terror legislation allowing law enforcement authorities to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=42+days+UK">detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days</a> [JURIST report] should not be passed as it could set a bad precedent for detention laws in other countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian government will table a bill at the August parliamentary session that would require criminal suspects to submit to DNA testing, according to a Monday report in the newspaper <a href="http://www.nanyang.com/index.php?"><em>Nanyang Siang Pau</em></a> [media website, in Malay]. If passed, the new law could compel Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] to undergo DNA testing as part of an investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy allegations</a> [JURIST report] made against him by a former aide.  The government has stated that the push to pass the bill is motivated by a desire to improve police crime-solving abilities, and is not an attack on Anwar, who last week <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-denounces.php">said he has no confidence</a> [JURIST report] in the Malaysian criminal system and doubts the credibility of DNA evidence.  He added, &quot;My accuser is still under police protection, and as such, any fabrication is possible if they take my DNA.&quot;  The <em>Straits Times</em> has <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest+News/S-E+Asia/STIStory_259843.html">more</a>.  The <em>Sun</em> has <a href="http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/home_ministry_to_fast_track_dna_identification_bill.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last week, Anwar was released on bail, one day after being <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by Malaysian authorities.  Anwar has claimed that the sodomy allegations leveled against him are politically motivated. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Earlier this month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A divorced Lebanese woman told the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/judicial_work/judicial_work.cfm">UK Law Lords</a> [Parliament backgrounder] Monday that her <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/1-press-releases/2008/mother-facing-separation-from-her-son.shtml">human rights would be violated</a> [Liberty press release] if she were deported to Lebanon, arguing that Lebanese <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/#2">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder] would put her and her son back under the control of her abusive ex-husband.  Under Sharia law, a divorced mother loses custody of her children when they turn seven, at which point custody must be given to the father.  The case could decide the extent to which the UK will grant asylum claims to people fleeing the implementation of Sharia law.  The woman sought asylum in 2004 using fraudulent papers and her claim was rejected in 2005.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080721/D9221QMG0.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In February, <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page2.asp">UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official website] rejected a suggestion by the nation&#39;s highest Christian cleric that UK Muslims be given an option to resolve some civil disputes under Sharia law rather than UK law. <a href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/1573">Speaking</a> [interview transcript] to the BBC, <a href="http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/about/bio.html">Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams</a> [official profile] appeared to agree that limited application of Sharia law might help to ease social tension between Muslims and other UK residents, but a Brown spokesperson said that the same laws must apply to every citizen.

Last week, three other men allegedly involved in the plot, <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/abdula_ahmed_ali.htm">Abdulla Ahmed Ali</a>, <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/assad_sarwar.htm">Assad Sarwar</a>, and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/tanvir_hussain.htm">Tanvir Hussain</a> [GlobalSecurity profiles], admitted that they planned to set off bombs but insisted that their only intention was to create a media stir to promote an anti-western film they planned to make.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Attorney General <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Michael Mukasey</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>] said on Monday that <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/vidLink.php?b=1216652400&e=1216655400&n=1">Congress should pass legislation</a> [C-SPAN video, Flash; <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2008/ag-speech-0807213.html">transcript</a>] guiding US civilian courts on how to conduct Guantanamo detainees&#39; <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> proceedings because the judiciary should not make such determinations. Mukasey reiterated the Bush administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bush-mukasey-criticize-supreme-court.php">disappointment</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court&#39;s June <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that federal courts have jurisdiction to review <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas</span> petitions filed by Guantanamo detainees, but said that the government&#39;s job now is to form policy in line with the Court&#39;s decision that will guide how courts handle the cases: <blockquote>Congress and the Executive Branch are affirmatively charged by our Constitution with protecting national security, are expert in such matters, and are in the best position to weigh the difficult policy choices that are posed by these issues. Judges play an important role in deciding whether a chosen policy is consistent with our laws and the Constitution, but it is our elected leaders who have the responsibility for making policy choices in the first instance. So today, I am urging Congress to act &#8211; to resolve the difficult questions left open by the Supreme Court. I am urging Congress to pass legislation to ensure that the proceedings mandated by the Supreme Court are conducted in a responsible and prompt way and, as the Court itself urged, in a practical way.</blockquote> Mukasey said that Congress must pass legislation so that enemy combatants are not allowed into the US either for court proceedings or on release orders.  He added that Congress  must ensure that courts use processes protecting citizens and classified information while affording detainees their necessary rights.  He emphasized his belief that it is necessary to encourage the continuation of military tribunals and eliminate inconsistent rulings and multiple trials for detainees. Rights groups such as the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [official website] have <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-executive-director-vincent-warren-denounces-mukasey-scheme-have-congress">argued</a> [press release] that Mukasey&#39;s plan will lead to unnecessary legal proceedings and delays, but Mukasey asserted that the legislation will only cover procedural matters rather than whether the courts may hear the cases. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2140857120080721?sp=true">more</a>.<br /><br />Federal judges are also concerned about <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> trial efficiency. The chief judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [court website] said in early July that the US government should make detention appeals by Guantanamo detainees a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-calls-for-speedy.php">top priority</a> [JURIST report], and devote all necessary resources to ensuring that the appeals reach trial in a timely manner. <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/hogan-bio.html">Judge Thomas F. Hogan</a> [official profile] made the comments at the first hearing concerning coordination issues for the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habeas+corpus"><span style="font-style: italic;">habeas </span></a> [JURIST news archive] appeals of several terrorism detainees now being held at Guantanamo Bay. Hogan is tasked with establishing deadlines for the government to turn over evidence on the detainees to their lawyers, and he told the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to put other cases on hold while complying with these requests.

Boon Wan made the announcement before the country&#39;s parliament and said that the highly controversial plan was needed because of the high demand for kidney transplants. Boon Wan also said the government is considering raising the maximum age for deceased donors from whom it will accept kidneys, an approach more accepted by critics of the so-called &quot;kidney trading&quot; plan, who have also suggested that the country encourage more extended family members of potential transplantees to volunteer their organs if compatible.

The group has accused the government of illegally blocking attempts by MB candidates to run in local elections.  Muslim Brotherhood members officially run as independents in elections as the organization has been banned in <a href="/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] since 1954. The Egyptian government has accused the group of trying to create an Islamic theocracy through violence.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080721/D92277T80.html">more</a>.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL218692920080721">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In April, five Muslim Brotherhood members were <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/egypt-arrests-muslim-brotherhood.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] as they tried to hang campaign posters, joining the over 800 party members already in custody at that time, including 148 council election candidates.

The <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/ASEAN-Charter.pdf">charter</a> [PDF text] was designed to create stronger economic and security ties within the region, and Article 14 establishes a body to monitor human rights in member countries.  Myanmar&#39;s inclusion in the in charter has <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/asean-urged-to-put-rights-component-of.php">long been controversial</a> because of its human rights record, and critics have said that even the rights panel <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/asean-leaders-adopts-criticized-charter.php">will not have authority</a> [JURIST reports] to issue sanctions against member states found to have violated human rights. During ASEAN&#39;s <a href="http://www.41amm.sg/amm/">41st Ministerial Meeting</a> [official website] on Sunday, the members criticized Myanmar for holding Suu Kyi and other political prisoners: <blockquote>The Foreign Ministers expressed their deep disappointment that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi&#39;s detention under house arrest had been extended by the Myanmar Government. They repeated the call by ASEAN Leaders for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political detainees, as part of Myanmar&#39;s national reconciliation process. The Foreign Ministers reiterated their view that the Myanmar Government should engage in a meaningful dialogue with all political groups, and work towards a peaceful transition to democracy in the near future.</blockquote>At the end of the meeting, the ministers issued a <a href="http://www.aseansec.org/21771.htm">joint statement</a> [text] saying the group would remain engaged with Myanmar despite the problems, but critics <a href="http://globalnation.inquirer.net/news/breakingnews/view/20080721-149828/Observers-doubt-Myanmar-on-ASEAN-charter-pledges">expressed doubt</a>&nbsp;[AFP report] that the country would uphold the human rights standards included in the charter, especially if it would not face sanctions for infractions. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jgl0dMVy3IB6IUmgtJpnoxQn6BXAD9222LQO0">more</a>. The Canadian Press has <a href="http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5j7Ieh6W3_awPlrdfCRJ1ohrOM1EQ">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In November 2007, Singaporean human rights group <a href="http://www.sghumanrights.org/">SG Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/asean-urged-to-put-rights-component-of.php">called on ASEAN</a> [JURIST report] to make the human rights section of its proposed charter into a separate treaty because of Myanmar&#39;s record and initial resistance to the rights provisions.  Others outside the region have called on the group to suspend the country&#39;s participation entirely until conditions improve. Much of the international attention to Myanmar&#39;s human rights conditions is due to Suu Kyi, who has spent 12 of the past 18 years in prison or under house arrest for alleged violations of an <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/anti-subversion%20law.htm">anti-subversion law</a> [text].  The military junta <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/myanmar-junta-to-detain-democracy.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Suu Kyi&#39;s house arrest into a sixth year in May, causing an international outcry and demonstrations by her supporters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The head of the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Sunday presented a <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/news_details_ar.jsp?art_id=1226">plan</a> [press release, in Arabic] to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] recommending how he should react to an application for an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The effort to arrest the president is based on allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The 22-country group <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">held an emergency meeting</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday to discuss the pending charges and criticized ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] for seeking the arrest warrant. On Sunday, League <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/details_ar.jsp?art_id=4973&level_id=942">Secretary-General Amr Moussa</a> [offical profile] said that the group&#39;s reaction would be carefully considered rather than emotional and stressed: <blockquote>To us, cooperation must begin by standing on a solid position of law and political and human rights. There must be trials and justice and the prosecution of the instigators of the situation in Darfur and elsewhere.</blockquote> Mussa said that Sudanese officials generally accepted the plan, but declined to offer plan specifics. The <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> [official website] is scheduled to consider the issue Monday. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jspwFxvKwXIT9G7f3d0erP-25I8A">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sudan Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27963">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Moreno-Ocampo applied for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] last Monday for crimes al-Bashir allegedly committed in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The application, which followed a three-year investigation involving more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, began with the <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-us-allows-icc.php">referral of the situation to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor in 2005</a> [JURIST report].  This past June, Moreno-Ocampo stated before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221;  The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Pakistan Supreme Court Bar Association has adopted two annual days of remembrance to highlight the plight of judges deposed following the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-high-court-battles-musharraf.php">declaration of emergency</a> [JURIST report] by President Pervez Musharraf in November 2007.  The Bar Association will <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\07\19\story_19-7-2008_pg7_65">observe</a> [<em>Daily Times</em> report] Independence of Judiciary Day every year on July 20, and Black Day on November 3 of every year. The Bar Association also announced an <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\07\20\story_20-7-2008_pg7_9">August 14 deadline</a> [<em>Daily Times</em> report] for the reinstatement of the deposed judges, after which the lawyers&#39; movement would engage in a campaign of civil disobedience to force the government into action. Among the deposed judges are a number of justices of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website], including former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Speakers at a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/pakistan-lawyers-protest-senior-ruling.php">lawyer&#39;s movement protest</a> [JURIST report] two weeks ago, including prominent lawyers&#39; movement leader Hamid Khan, urged the PPP and the Pakistani government to implement the conditions of the <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/updates.asp?id=39768">Murree Accord</a> [<em>News</em> backgrounder], and indicated that the movement would not accept judges who had been appointed as a result of the declaration of emergency. From Pakistan, the<em> News</em> has <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15918">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, the reconstituted Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/pakistan-high-court-upholds-emergency.php">upheld Musharraf&#39;s declaration of emergency rule and the ouster of the judges</a> [JURIST report]. Days before the judgment, Pakistani Supreme Court Bar Association President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahsan">Aitzaz Ahsan</a> [JURIST news archive] strongly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/pakistan-bar-leader-criticizes-us.php">criticized US policy on Pakistan</a> [JURIST report], including its refusal to condemn the declaration of emergency rule. In June, members of the lawyers&#39; movement concluded a <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/pakistan-lawyers-reach-parliament-hold.php">&quot;long march&quot; protest</a> [JURIST report] from Lahore to Islamabad, calling for the reinstatement of the dismissed judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Cambodia has submitted a letter to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/un.php">news archive</a>] seeking to draw UN attention to its border dispute with Thailand. Disagreement between the two countries has arisen over the border area surrounding the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/asia/thailand/730106/%27Preah-Vihear-has-the-most-breathtaking-location%27.html">Preah Vihear temple</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> backgrounder], which both countries claim lies within their borders. AP reports that Cambodian Information Minister Khieu Kanharith said, &quot;Cambodia is not asking for UN intervention,&quot; and indicated that the letter was simply an attempt to highlight the conflict between the two countries. Last week, Thai protesters petitioned the country&#39;s <a href="http://nccc.thaigov.net/nccc/eng.php">National Counter-Corruption Commission</a> (NCCC) [officials website], asking it to bring new corruption charges against a number of government officials for allegedly granting Cambodia&#39;s full claim to the temple in exchange for personal favors to former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>]. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h6tp2tO94iKNqIquUil4we_HH52QD921D6QO1">more</a>.  The <em>Bangkok Post</em> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=128963">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, Thailand&#39;s <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Thai] ruled that current prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] violated the country&#39;s constitution by <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-support-for-cambodia-heritage.php">dropping Thai claims</a> [JURIST report] to the temple without parliamentary approval. Opponents of the temple transfer have called for those involved to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">impeached and charged with treason</a> [JURIST report], while others have called for the government to <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=128859">rescind its recognition of the bid</a> or <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/140708_News/14Jul2008_news13.php">join in the multinational force</a> [Bangkok Post reports] that will guard the site. The UN notification arises three weeks after the <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29008&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html">UN Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) [official website] approved a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/fr/actualites/451">Cambodian application</a> [UNESCO press release, in French] for recognition of the temple as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Tensions have long existed between Thailand and Cambodia concerning the Preah Vihear temple, as both countries have claimed a right to the structure. In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4871.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the temple was officially located in Cambodia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/533/533.pdf">Human Rights Annual Report 2007</a> [text, PDF] released Sunday by the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/foreign_affairs_committee.cfm">House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [committee website] recommended that the UK not rely on any assurances made by the US that it does not use torture.  The report also calls on the UK to fully investigate US interrogation tactics to ensure that no torture techniques are being used on US detainees. The report&#39;s section on torture focuses on <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=water+boarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] and the disconnect between US statements that the practice does not constitute torture and testimony by UK <a href="http://www.davidmiliband.info/">Foreign Secretary David Miliband</a> [official website] that &quot;water-boarding [sic] amounts to torture.&quot; The Foreign Affairs Committee wrote in the report:<blockquote>We conclude that the Foreign Secretary&#39;s view that water-boarding is an instrument of torture is to be welcomed. However, given the recent practice of water-boarding by the US, there are serious implications arising from the Foreign Secretary&#39;s stated position. We conclude that, given the clear differences in definition, the UK can no longer rely on US assurances that it does not use torture, and we recommend that the Government does not rely on such assurances in the future. We also recommend that the Government should immediately carry out an exhaustive analysis of current US interrogation techniques on the basis of such information as is publicly available or which can be supplied by the US. We further recommend that, once its analysis is completed, the Government should inform this Committee and Parliament as to its view on whether there are any other interrogation techniques that may be approved for use by the US Administration which it considers to constitute torture.</blockquote> BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7515517.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-commons-committee-deplores-false-us.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] what it termed &quot;false US assurances&quot; about rendition flights through the UK Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. The committee also said the &quot;failure of the United States Administration to tell the truth resulted in the UK Government inadvertently misleading&quot; the committee and House of Commons about US operations on a <a href="http://www.dg.navy.mil/web/">military base</a> [official website] located on the island. Lawyers for <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], a UK legal charity representing some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/documents/FinalReprieveSubmissionFASC.pdf">alleged</a> [report, PDF] last year that UK overseas territories have been used &quot;to support illegal interstate transfer, enforced disappearance and torture in the context of the &#39;war on terror&#39;&quot; and urged UK lawmakers to question US and UK officials about the allegations. In 2005, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Manfred Nowak said there had been allegations that the US was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/un-torture-investigator-us-may-be.php">secretly detaining prisoners on military vessels</a> [JURIST report] at the Diego Garcia naval base.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA3LTExMDQtY3Jfb3BuLnBkZg==/07-1104-cr_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl27cf/2/hilite">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the acquittal of David Finnerty, a former specialist trader at Fleet Specialist Inc., a subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corp., who had been accused of making improper trades for his firm&#8217;s account on the <a href="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) [official website].  The three-judge panel unanimously decided that while Finnerty broke NYSE rules, prosecutors failed to prove that his conduct was deceptive, an essential element of the crime: <br /><blockquote>Th[e] evidence shows that Finnerty knew he had violated an NYSE rule, and tried to cover it up.  But violation of an NYSE rule does not establish securities fraud in the civil context, let alone in a criminal prosecution... Finnerty may have known that interpositioning was wrong within the context of his employment, and that it put him at risk professionally, but an awareness of peril, a guilty conscience or an impulse to cover one&#8217;s tracks does not bespeak criminally fraudulent conduct within the context of the securities laws. </blockquote>In 2005, Finnerty and 14 other brokers were indicted on charges of &#8220;interpositioning,&#8221; a process in which brokers step in front of their customers to intercept trades at more favorable prices. A jury found Finnerty guilty of three counts of securities fraud in October 2006.  That judgment was <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/whitecollarcrime_blog/files/us_v_finnerty_d_ct_opinion_feb_21_2007.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] in February 2007 by US District Judge Denny Chin, who held that the government had not proven the defendant&#8217;s conduct defrauded customers.  Prosecutors suspect that Finnerty&#8217;s conduct resulted in illegal profits of approximately $4.5 million. CNN has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200807181244DOWJONESDJONLINE000670_FORTUNE5.htm">more</a>. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/27/national/main580134.shtml">Bank of America</a> [CBS News report on merger] has since acquired FleetBoston Financial Corp. and has been subject to litigation based on events which allegedly occurred prior to the merger.  One class action lawsuit was brought seeking recovery for damages caused by the alleged <a href="http://securities.stanford.edu/1029/FBF04-01/">&quot;timing&quot;</a> [Stanford Law backgrounder] of mutual fund trades so as to benefit preferred clients at the expense of other investors. A previous action alleged fraudulent conduct in the description of <a href="http://membrane.com/lawtomation/dmlaw/class/credit_card_fees.html">credit card fees</a> [<em>Legal Intelligencer</em> report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic] issued a resolution on Saturday criticizing International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] for seeking the arrest of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The 22-country group, which held an emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the pending charges, rebuked the prosecutor for his &#8220;unbalanced stance&#8221; and said that an indictment &#8211; the first ever against a sitting head of state &#8211; would set a dangerous and destabilizing precedent.  The resolution stated: <blockquote>The council decides solidarity with the Republic of Sudan in confronting schemes that undermine its sovereignty, unity and stability and their non-acceptance of the unbalanced, not objective position of the prosecutor general of the Internal Criminal Court.</blockquote>  Arab League officials recommended that domestic trials be used in lieu of ICC prosecutions, vowing that &#8220;effective justice will be realized with the follow-up of the Arab League and the African Union.&#8221; AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iSU85U0n3gyHP-Qj6y0XALF8wlDQ">more</a>.<br /><br />Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo applied for an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] last Monday for President al-Bashir for atrocities committed in the Darfur region of Sudan.  The application, which followed a three-year investigation involving more than 100 witnesses in 18 countries, began with the <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-us-allows-icc.php">referral of the situation to the Office of the Chief Prosecutor in 2005</a> [JURIST report].  This past June, Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo stated before the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] in June that &#8220;evidence shows that the commission of such crimes on such a scale, over a period of five years, and throughout Darfur, has required the sustained mobilization of the entire Sudanese state apparatus.&#8221;  The Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the ICC investigation</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://djournal9to5.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/fifth-circuit-opinion-on-bishop-lethal-injection-case.pdf">denied an emergency stay</a> [opinion, PDF] for a Mississippi death row inmate challenging the state&#39;s lethal injection procedure.  The court found that Dale Leo Bishop failed to establish that he would suffer an irreparable injury if the stay of execution was not granted while he appealed a lower court&#39;s decision that dismissed his constitutional challenge to Mississippi&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lethal+injection">lethal injection</a> [JURIST news archive] procedure for failure to comply with the statute of limitations.  In a dissent, Judge King argued: <blockquote>[G]iven the fact that the adequacy of Mississippi&#8217;s protocol was effectively never litigated in this case, it seems to me highly inappropriate for the majority to import from <em>Baze</em> language suggesting that a stay may not be granted unless a showing is made of a substantial risk of severe pain, and then go on to decide whether such a showing has been made. Putting aside the fact that Bishop arguably has made such a showing... the effect of this is, again, to require Bishop to show a likelihood of success on the merits of an issue that was not developed below and is not part of this appeal.</blockquote> Bishop had asserted a claim under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">42 U.S.C. &sect;1983</a> [text], which provides civil redress for the deprivation of any rights secured by the US Constitution, arguing that Mississippi&#39;s lethal injection procedure &#8220;unnecessarily risks infliction of pain and suffering.&quot;  The appeals court also noted that Bishop failed to establish that his appeal was likely to succeed on the merits, or that the stay would serve the public interest and not result in substantial harm to the other parties.  Bishop is <a href="http://www.djournal.com/pages/story.asp?ID=276473&pub=1&div=News">scheduled to be executed</a> [<em>Daily Journal</em> report] Wednesday evening.<br /><br />In denying Bishop&#39;s request, the Fifth Circuit drew parallels between Mississippi&#39;s lethal injection procedure and Kentucky&#39;s protocol recently analyzed by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/bazvree">Baze v. Rees</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/supreme-court-weighs-constitutionality.php">report</a>]. The Court held in that case that a stay of execution is not proper unless a state&#39;s execution procedure presents a &quot;demonstrated risk of severe pain.&quot;  The Supreme Court decided that Kentucky&#39;s use of a <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&did=479#injection">three-drug lethal injection cocktail</a> [DPIC backgrounder] did not satisfy this threshold, and further stated that any state procedure that was &quot;substantially similar&quot; would also fail to meet this standard.<br /><br />7/24/08 - Bishop was executed by lethal injection at 6:14 PM on Wednesday. AP has <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/218/story/701952.html">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two members of the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.shtml">US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> [official website] began an <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110-ltr.072208.FDA.Ranbaxy.pdf">investigation</a> [information request, PDF; <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110nr323.shtml">press release</a>] Tuesday into whether the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) allowed the continued sale of certain drugs that agency officials knew had been manufactured and sold using faulty data. The investigation began after the US Attorney for the District of Maryland filed a <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110-Motion.071708.ranbaxy.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] with the district court early this month seeking to enforce subpoenas against pharmaceutical company <a href="http://www.ranbaxy.com/">Ranbaxy Laboratories</a> [corporate website], which the government suspected of fraud, mislabeling its products, conspiracy and making false statements in violation of federal law. The motion also alleged that the FDA knew of these possible violations for 18 months but took no action. In the Committee&#39;s information request, the Representatives wrote: <blockquote>Unfortunately, the FDA&#39;s alleged lack of action to remove these suspect products from the market requires this Committee to review the pre-market approval inspections of all currently marketed Ranbaxy drugs, as well as any &quot;for cause&quot; inspections, to determine if FDA has expended the resources required to justify leaving these suspect drugs on the market.</blockquote> The Committee has requested all related preapproval and investigatory documents, lists of all suppliers and laboratories that performed bioequivalency tests, and a list of all involved FDA personnel. The FDA must provide the documents within two weeks, and the Committee wants to complete its interviews by the end of August. Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/health/idUKN2233429620080723">more</a>.<br /><br />Ranbaxy has previously come under scrutiny by the US justice system and the FDA. In 2005, US District Court Judge Dickinson Debevoise <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/corporations-and-securities-brief-aig_30.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Ranbaxy had to stop production of its generic version of Pfizer Inc.&#39;s blood-pressure drug <span style="font-style:italic;">Accupril</span> because Pfizer was likely to win a patent-infringement lawsuit filed against Ranbaxy. In June 2006, the FDA revoked its approval from a Ranbaxy dosage form center, and in February 2007, the FDA <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/US-FDA-raids,-shuts-Ranbaxy%92s-US-HQ/192113/">raided and closed</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Express</span> report] Ranbaxy&#39;s US headquarters in New Jersey.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/breaking-news/story/615436.html">walked out of the courtroom</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] at his military commission trial on Wednesday, refusing to watch a video depicting one of his interrogation sessions. Hamdan&#39;s lawyers had sought to have his interrogations excluded from evidence, arguing that they violated his right against self-incrimination under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5afrag1_user.html#amdt5a_hd4">Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution</a> [text], but presiding judge Navy Capt. Keith Allred <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/07/21/18/suppress-D-029_and_D-044_Ruling.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/hamdan-not-entitled-to-fifth-amendment.php">report</a>] that, as a so-called &quot;enemy combatant,&quot; Hamdan is not entitled to Fifth Amendment protections. On Tuesday, FBI Special Agent <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/07/10/060710on_onlineonly01">Ali Soufan</a> [<em>New Yorker</em> discussion] had testified that Guantanamo detainees <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080723/D923GH100.html">are not advised of their legal rights</a> [AP report] before interrogations.  Soufan said that interrogators were told they could forgo reading suspects their rights because <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] activities do not involve law enforcement.  He added that he had always informed suspects of their rights before performing interrogations elsewhere in the world.  <br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001 when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. Last week, Allred <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case.  Hamdan pleaded not guilty to <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d2007Hamdan%20-%20Notification%20of%20Sworn%20Charges.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet] of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorism at the beginning of the trial Monday. He is the first so-called &quot;enemy combatant&quot; to be tried by a military commission at Guantanamo.  In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott</a> his military commission trial, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until this month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US House of Representatives on Wednesday passed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3221">Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 </a> [HR 3221 materials; House debate <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=206521-1">video</a>, flash], a bill designed to address problems from the country&#39;s so-called &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot; The Act provides for government grants allowing municipalities to buy and redevelop foreclosed properties, and would allow the federal government to provide additional financial backing to the publicly supported <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a>&nbsp;[corporate websites] mortgage companies. The bill passed by a vote of 272-152, and is also expected to be approved by the Senate later this week. President Bush has said he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/business/24housing.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin">will sign the bill</a> [NYT report],&nbsp;rescinding&nbsp;an earlier veto threat because of the included grants. Opponents of the bill have said it puts an unfair burden on taxpayers by &quot;socializing costs&quot; but &quot;privatizing profits,&quot; of the mortgage industry, and that bill sponsors have tacked on unnecessary and controversial measures to the otherwise&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;Act.  McClatchy has <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/45301.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/meetings/2008/20080714/draftfedreg.pdf">approved new rules for home mortgage loans</a> [draft regulations, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-reserve-board-approves.php">report</a>] designed to reduce unfair lending practices and increase consumer protection.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Mexican woman <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crt-641.html">pleaded guilty</a> [DOJ press release] Tuesday in the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/index.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] to one count of sex trafficking for her role in recruiting Mexican women, sometimes by force, for prostitution in the US. Consuelo Carreto Valencia was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/January/07_ag_030.html">extradited to the US</a> in January 2007, and in March 2007 was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/March/07_crt_127.html">arraigned</a> [DOJ press releases] in federal court on 27 counts of sex trafficking, conspiracy and smuggling. Her trial on 12 of those counts began Monday but ended Tuesday with her guilty plea. The Department of Justice (DOJ) commented on the charges: <blockquote>From 1991 through 2004, Carreto Valencia served as a manager in her family&#8217;s sex trafficking operation based in San Miguel de Tenancingo, Tlaxcala, Mexico. Carreto Valencia, and her sons Josue Flores Carreto and Gerardo Flores Carreto, and other co-conspirators, recruited young, uneducated women and girls from impoverished areas of Mexico and used or approved of a combination of deception, fraud, rape, forced abortion, threats, and physical violence to compel them to prostitute themselves in brothels throughout the New York City metropolitan area, including Queens and Brooklyn. Carreto Valencia and her family made hundreds of thousands of dollars in prostitution profits, while the women who had been separated from their families in Mexico received next to nothing.</blockquote> Josue Flores Carreto and Gerardo Flores Carreto were each <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2006/2006apr27.html">sentenced</a> [DOJ press release] in April 2006 to 50 years in prison for their roles in the prostitution scheme. Carreto Valencia could be sentenced to up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/nyregion/23madam.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2008/07/23/2008-07-23_guilty_plea_in_mexiconyc_human_smuggling-2.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />A 2007 US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82902.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] mandated by the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/10492.pdf">Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000</a> (VTPA) [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-human-trafficking-report-cites.php">ranked Mexico</a> [JURIST report] among 32 countries or territories on the &quot;Tier 2 Watch List,&quot; a classification for countries that continue to face a significant or growing human trafficking problem. In February 2008, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/mexico0208/">reported</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mexico-human-rights-panel-failing-to.php">report</a>] that Mexico&#39;s <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> (CNDH) [official website, in Spanish] was not doing enough to promote remedies and reforms needed to end human rights abuses.  It is <a href="http://www.humantrafficking.org/countries/united_states_of_america">estimated</a> [advocacy website] that thousands of victims of human trafficking enter the US each year, often lured by promises of work.

BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7521024.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Key to the Crown&#39;s case against the men was the testimony of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6242483.stm">Mohammed Babar</a> [BBC profile], an American citizen of Pakistani descent who worked with the defendants and later <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/11/ny.terror.suspect/">pleaded guilty to terrorism charges</a> [CNN report] in New York in 2004. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/khawaja_mohammad.html">Mohammed Momin Khawaja</a> [CBC backgrounder], who was <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/canadians-charge-first-suspect-under.htm">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the operation in Canada and is currently awaiting trial there, was identified at trial as another co-conspirator.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Attorney General <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Michael Mukasey</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/testimony/2008/ag-testimony-080723.html">announced</a>&nbsp;[prepared statement, PDF; <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/072208.html">press release</a>] to the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a>&nbsp;[official website] Wednesday that during his remaining time in office he will focus primarily on addressing the legal rights of US-held <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatants</a> and ensuring that <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=voting+rights">voting rights</a> [JURIST news archives] laws are adhered to in upcoming elections. He also told the Committee that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is working to address concerns that its employment decisions have been <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=doj+political">politically influenced</a> [JURIST news archive] in recent years. Reiterating his <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2008/ag-speech-0807213.html">belief</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/congress-should-guide-courts-through.php">report</a>] that it is inappropriate for the judicial branch to outline the process for trying terrorism suspects, Mukasey said:<blockquote>Congress and the Executive Branch are in a better position than the courts to create practical procedures and rules to govern the <em>habeas corpus</em> hearings required by the Supreme Court, procedures and rules that would both give the detainees what process they are due and accommodate the grave national security concerns involved. In my speech earlier this week, I outlined six principles that should guide such legislation, and I look forward to working with you and your colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress to address these important issues promptly.</blockquote> Mukasey informed the Committee of his plans to monitor the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/overview.htm#vra">legality</a> [Voting Rights Act backgrounder] of the upcoming presidential elections:<blockquote>The Department will maintain a significant presence throughout the election season through both outreach and monitoring. We will work closely with civil rights groups and state and local elections officials to identify and solve problems. We will publicize telephone numbers and websites through which people can bring potential issues to our attention. And, on Election Day, we will deploy hundreds of observers and monitors around the country.<br /><br />These steps will supplement our ongoing efforts both to enforce laws, including the Voting Rights Act, designed to guarantee access of all Americans to the ballot and to enforce laws, including those prohibiting voter fraud and campaign finance abuse, intended to safeguard the integrity of the voting process. All these efforts are essential in ensuring that elections reflect the will of the people, and in maintaining the confidence of all Americans in our system of government.</blockquote>Mukasey also defended the Bush administration&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-invokes-executive-privilege-in-cia.php">invocation of executive privilege</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in refusing to produce documents related to the Valerie Plame CIA leak investigation. UPI has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/07/23/Mukasey_pledges_to_fix_Justice_Dept_rep/UPI-31631216825458/">more</a>.<br /><br />The issues Mukasey discussed in his statement have garnered a great deal of media attention in recent weeks.  In June, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that federal courts have jurisdiction to review <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions filed by Guantanamo Bay detainees, and that the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions+act">news archive</a>] did not limit detainees&#39; right to federal judicial review. Also that month, political bias in DOJ hiring practices was made public in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0806/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">report</a>] by the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website], a revelation which has already resulted in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-intern-sues-doj-for-partisan.php">lawsuit</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ethics-group-files-bar-complaints.php">ethics complaints</a> [JURIST reports] against the department.

Kurdish legislators boycotted a Tuesday vote on the bill in the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic], objecting to an attached proposal that would establish a provincial council in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] to include equal numbers of Kurdish, Arab and Turkmeni representatives.  Kurds, who constitute the majority of the area&#39;s population, argue that this arrangement does not reflect the region&#39;s true population.  The bill <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/Iraqi_Council_of_Representatives.php?name=articles_ajsdyawqwqdjasdba46s7a98das6dasda7das4da6sd8asdsawewqeqw465e4qweq4wq6e4qw8eqwe4qw6eqwe4sadkj&file=showdetails&sid=1911">passed</a> [Council of Representatives press release, in Arabic; AP <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080723/D923GPU80.html">report</a>] despite the boycott before going to Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council for final approval. Talabani said that the council would likely <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/Iraqi_Council_of_Representatives.php?name=articles_ajsdyawqwqdjasdba46s7a98das6dasda7das4da6sd8asdsawewqeqw465e4qweq4wq6e4qw8eqwe4qw6eqwe4sadkj&file=showdetails&sid=1916">reject the bill</a> [Council of Representatives press release, in Arabic], which would mean delays for scheduled October elections, as it would need to be sent back to parliament for redrafting. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hdMejDPUZGJWX3JekOBwhxHrfWAA">more</a>.<br /><br />Kurdish parliamentarians <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/kurdish-lawmakers-protest-draft.php">staged a walkout</a> [JURIST report] in protest last Tuesday, delaying a vote on the proposed bill.   In February, the Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected a draft provincial elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] that will lead to the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners. In March, the Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-presidency-council-withdraws.php">withdrew its objections</a> [JURIST report], indicating that the law could take effect without any changes.

The decision is seen as a concession to intense <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-plan-to-fingerprint-roma.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] of the fingerprinting plan by the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1315385&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">international human rights community</a> [COE statement] and <a href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2958">Roma advocates</a> [ERRC materials].  Earlier this month, the Italian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-begins-mass-fingerprinting-of.php">began carrying out the plan</a> [JURIST report] to record the fingerprints of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080722/D9236S080.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, a committee of the <a href="http://www.camera.it/index.asp">Italian House of Deputies</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-national-fingerprinting-plan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] funding for a universal fingerprinting plan to begin in 2010.  Italian leaders have pushed for all Italian citizens and resident foreigners to be fingerprinted for national ID cards, a move seen by some as an attempt to deflect accusations of &quot;<a href="http://euobserver.com/22/26408">ethnic cataloguing</a>&quot; [EUobserver report] of the country&#39;s Roma population.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan plans to create its own internationally-monitored courts to try war crimes suspects from the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive], <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> (LAS) [official website, in Arabic] official Hisham Yussef said on Tuesday.  The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] in the Netherlands currently handles such proceedings, but if Sudanese domestic courts are created with appropriate human rights and accountability safeguards, the ICC is required to hand over jurisdiction under Article 16 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF text]. The announcement is seen largely as a reaction to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">controversial effort</a> [JURIST report] to seek an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/406.html">press release</a>] for Sudanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>]. Both the LAS and <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">criticized</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] the warrant and underlying indictment, saying they threaten peace in the unstable country. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL221012497.html">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Sudan Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27983">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The LAS released its <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/news_details_ar.jsp?art_id=1226">proposal</a> [press release, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-plans-response-to-possible.php">report</a>] for the country to create the courts on Sunday, following an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-seeks-arab-league-talks-over.php">emergency meeting</a> [JURIST report] to mediate the dispute over the ICC&#39;s warrant for al-Bashir. The AU also released a <a href="Http://www.africa-union.org/root/ua/actualites/2008/juillet/psc/142-communique-eng.pdf">resolution</a> [PDF text] Monday calling on the ICC to defer to Sudanese courts once they are legitimized. &nbsp;The UN Security Council has repeatedly called on Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the investigation of al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office. Before al-Bashir&#39;s&nbsp;indictment&nbsp;the Sudanese government had already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">has refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20080722/index.htm">ruled</a> [petitioner press release] on Tuesday that the government must unseal most of the grand jury testimony from the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/Rosenberg/RosenbergTrial.pdf">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg espionage case</a> [trial transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/trials6.htm">backgrounder</a>]. In January, George Washington University&#39;s National Security Archive <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20080131/filings/petition.pdf">petitioned the court</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20080131/filings/memo.pdf">memorandum</a>, PDF] for the release of the transcripts, arguing that &quot;The overwhelming historical interest outweighs any secrecy interests that may have survived.&quot; The government <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20080626/Rosenberg-govtbrief.pdf">responded</a> [brief, PDF] in June: <blockquote>The Government does not dispute that the Rosenberg atomic spy trial is a case of significant historical importance within the meaning of the &quot;special circumstances&quot; exception, and does not oppose the entry of an Order unsealing the grand jury testimony of those Rosenberg grand jury witnesses who are deceased or who consent to disclosure, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span> 35 of the 45 witnesses who testified before the grand jury. The Government, however, opposes disclosure of the testimony of the remaining witnesses who either: (1) object to disclosure; or (2) are not deceased and cannot be located to determine their position on disclosure. As to these witnesses, the public&#39;s forward looking interest in ensuring that future grand jury witnesses are not dissuaded from coming forward and testifying in high profile cases trumps the need for disclosure at this time.</blockquote> The federal judge ordered the disclosure of 36 witnesses&#39; testimony and encouraged the government to quickly locate any living witnesses to seek their permission to release the testimony. The National Security Archive specifically <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/news/20080722/07142008_Petitioners_reply_brief.pdf">requested</a> [brief, PDF] that the judge unseal the testimony of Ethel Rosenberg&#39;s brother and key witness <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_BDGR.HTM">David Greenglass</a> [profile], but the judge denied the request because Greenglass objected to the release of his testimony. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/nyregion/23rosenberg.html?ref=us">more</a>. CNN has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/07/22/rosenberg.hearing/?iref=mpstoryview">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The grand jury testimony from the case was given in 1950 and 1951, and the grand jury subsequently indicted the Rosenbergs for 11 distinct acts in violation of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_4.html">US espionage statutes</a> [50 USC 4 materials]. A jury <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_TVER.HTM">found them guilty of the charges</a> [verdict transcript] in 1953, and they were sentenced to death and executed the same year.

Critics have argued that the law was specifically designed to suspend Berlusconi&#39;s own trials on <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi+corruption">corruption charges</a> [JURIST news archive].    The bill passed by a vote of 171-128, and Italian President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4758935.stm">Giorgio Napolitano</a> [BBC profile] must sign it before it can take effect. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a38K73KjXYls">more</a>.<br /><br />Italy has recently faced significant criticism by both <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-criticized-for-dissolving-anti.php">advocacy groups</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-judges-threaten-strike-over.php">members of the country&#39;s judiciary</a> [JURIST reports] for relaxing its anti-corruption measures. The majority of the criticism has been targeted at Berlusconi, who has faced trial on at least six occasions involving charges of <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/italy-ex-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial.php">false accounting, tax fraud, money laundering, embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/former-italy-pm-berlusconi-faces.php">giving false testimony</a> [JURIST reports]. In October 2007, Italy&#39;s highest court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/italy-high-court-upholds-berlusconi.php">upheld</a> Berlusconi&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/berlusconi-acquitted-of-bribery-charges.php">acquittal</a> [JURIST reports] on bribery charges. That trial was initially blocked in 2004 by a bill drafted by Berlusconi ally and later defense lawyer Gaetano Pecorella but went ahead after the bill was struck down as unconstitutional. Berlusconi has said he is innocent on all charges and has accused prosecutors of pursuing a political vendetta against him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The US <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072539p.pdf">affirmed</a> [decision, PDF] a lower court&#39;s <a href="http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/07D0346P.pdf">decision</a> [PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/child-online-protection-act-struck-down.php">report</a>] granting a permanent injunction against enforcement of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000231----000-.html">Child Online Protection Act</a> (COPA) [text], a federal law that imposes civil and criminal penalties on website operators for making sexually explicit materials available to minors over the Internet.  The Act also requires adult websites to verify viewer age with a credit card number or any other reasonable method of age verification.  The court stated that &quot;because COPA is a content-based restriction on protected speech, it is presumptively invalid and the Government bears the burden of showing its constitutionality.&quot;  Finding that the requirements of strict scrutiny were not fulfilled, the court relied heavily on the findings of fact from the lower court, and reasoned:  <blockquote>During oral argument, the Government contended that the First Amendment does not prohibit Congress from adopting a &#8220;belt-and-suspenders&#8221; approach to addressing the compelling<br />government interest of protecting minors from accessing harmful material on the Web, with filters acting as the &#8220;belt&#8221; and COPA as the &#8220;suspenders.&#8221; But as counsel for plaintiffs correctly pointed out, under the First Amendment, if the belt works at least as effectively as the suspenders, then the Government cannot prosecute people for not wearing suspenders.</blockquote> AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hEo4p1DhHwR6Qqr81gh0kVSLbP7gD9233I3G2">more</a>.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/internet/36071prs20080722.html">lauded</a> [ACLU press release] the Third Circuit&#39;s decision, calling it a &quot;clear victory for free speech.&quot; The ACLU has argued that COPA allows the government to censor speech on the Internet and the group challenged the constitutionality of COPA in October 1998, the day after it was passed into law.  Last year, Google <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/doj-google-to-spar-over-search-data-in.php">fought a Justice Department subpoena</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/multimedia/mercurynews/news/google0119.pdf">subpoena text</a>, PDF] seeking to force the search engine giant to hand over a large amount of user data, including one week&#39;s worth of query searches and up to 1 million web addresses as part of a federal effort to rewrite COPA.

Under <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/telecom.html">current rules</a> [FCC materials], if a telecom company files a petition to be exempted from an FCC competition-related rule, the exemption is typically granted by default unless the FCC explicitly denies the request. The result, according to the broadband and VoIP companies, is that traditional phone companies can effectively obstruct competitors&#39; access to consumers and maintain de-facto service monopolies. An <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN02469:">identical bill</a> [S 2469 materials] is being considered by the Senate.

At the center of of the witnesses&#39; complaints was the so-called &quot;last mile&quot; of service - local telephone poles and other systems that are owned by traditional phone companies and deliver internet, cable, and phone service directly to customers&#39; homes.  Despite rules that prohibit them from excluding competitors from utilizing these government-subsidized systems, non-traditional telecom companies <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/xo-communications-ceo-carl-j/story.aspx?guid=%7B9AD61BB5-ABFF-4B12-B4D3-5D55B92F557A%7D&dist=hppr">say</a> [press release] the so-called &quot;Baby Bells&quot; have disconnected copper phone lines they depend upon, and charge exorbitant rates for the addition of competing, non-cable broadband wires.</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Canadian <a href="http://www.infocom.gc.ca/menu-e.asp">Office of the Information Commissioner</a> (OIC) [official website] announced Monday that it appealed a <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court</a> [court website] decision in which the Court found that certain notes, records and correspondence generated by government ministers and their staff are not subject to public access under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/frame/cs/A-1///en">Access to Information Act</a> [text]. In <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2008/2008fc766/2008fc766.pdf"><u>Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (National Defence)</u></a> [opinion text], the Federal Court held that the only records and correspondence in ministers&#39; offices that are subject to the Act are those that can be requested and obtained by a deputy minister or senior official to deal with departmental matters.  The OIC said in a <a href="http://www.infocom.gc.ca/pressreleases/preleaseview-e.asp?intPreleaseId=57">press release</a> [text]: <blockquote>The court ruled that records in ministers&#8217; offices are not subject to disclosure under the Act, apart from certain records deemed to be under the department&#8217;s control. The criterion set by the court for establishing which records fall into this category is that they can be requested and obtained by the Deputy Minister or by senior officials to deal with departmental matters. The Information Commissioner&#8217;s position is that this criterion leaves the determination of which records come under the control of the department open to interpretation and could severely limit the scope of the Access to Information Act.  In the Commissioner&#8217;s view, a record generated or obtained by a Minister, or on his behalf, relating to the administration of their department, is subject to the Act regardless of where the record is located.</blockquote> The <em>Globe and Mail</em> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080722.waccess22/BNStory/National/home">more</a>.<br /><br />The lawsuit arose in part out of attempts to gain access to the daily agenda books of <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=2aa8c3e9-f46e-4c78-b9ff-04bec0ed5050&Language=E&Section=FederalExperience">former prime minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien</a> [official profile]. The access request was made by a researcher affiliated with the now-defunct Canadian Alliance party, a conservative party that opposed Chr&eacute;tien&#39;s <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/">Liberal Party</a> [party website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The China <a href="http://english.mofcom.gov.cn/">Ministry of Commerce</a> [official website, English version] said Tuesday that Chinese officials disagreed with and could challenge a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news08_e/339_340_342r_e.htm">report</a> [materials; <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/339_340_342r_conc_e.pdf">conclusions and recommendations</a>, PDF] which states that the country illegally taxes and disfavors imported auto parts. The <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds340_e.htm">US</a>, <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds339_e.htm">EU</a>, and <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds342_e.htm">Canada</a> [WTO dispute summaries] submitted complaints in March, alleging that China was taxing auto parts imported from those countries at the same rate that it taxed foreign-made finished cars in violation of promises made upon accession to the WTO and in violation of the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/06-gatt_e.htm">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994</a> (GATT 1994) [text]. The panel recommended Friday in its report that the WTO <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_e.htm">Dispute Settlement Body</a> [official website] &quot;request China to bring these inconsistent measures as listed above into conformity with its obligations under the GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement,&quot; but Chinese officials maintain that the country&#39;s policies are in line with its obligations. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/22/business/AS-China-WTO-Auto-Parts.php">more</a>.<br /><br />Since its accession to the WTO in December 2001, China has been the subject of a number of complaints, most prominently disputes with the US regarding the protection of US intellectual property from piracy in China.  China has also initiated two disputes with the US in the WTO over anti-dumping laws and US steel tariffs.  In April 2007, China <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/china-officials-denounce-us-decision-to.php">denounced</a> a US decision to <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/us-filing-copyright-enforcement-case.php">file a copyright enforcement case against China in the WTO</a> [JURIST reports].

A 2003 amendment to the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeofAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm">state constitution</a> [text] says that felons convicted of &quot;crimes of moral turpitude&quot; are ineligible to vote, and specifies 15 qualifying crimes.  <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Alabama Attorney General Troy King</a> [official website] put forth a list of additional crimes that would bar voting in 2005, and the ACLU alleges that his action was in violation of the state constitution, which only allows the legislature to make such designations.  The lawsuit seeks to restrict disenfranchising crimes to only those listed by the legislature. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080722/D922R6HG0.html">more</a>.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/us/22voting.html?_r=1&ref=us&oref=login">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February, the ACLU filed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/aclu-challenges-tennessee-voting-rights.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court challenging a Tennessee state law that requires convicted felons to pay &quot;all outstanding legal financial obligations&quot; before their voting rights are restored. The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.tnmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee</a> [official website], alleges that such a financial burden violates the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [LII text] by &quot;discriminat[ing] among citizens on the basis of wealth.&quot;

Louisiana</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">report</a>], where it found that imposing the death sentence for child rape where the victim was not killed constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court had noted in that ruling that very few states had such laws and that - incorrectly - there were no federal laws allowing the punishment for rape, but lawyers for Louisiana argued in their bid for rehearing that a 2006 amendment to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/stApIIch47.html">Uniform Code of Military Conduct</a> [LII materials] does in fact allow the death penalty at court-martial for rape and child rape.  It is highly unusual for the Court to agree to such petitions, but Louisiana lawyers say a review is warranted because of that oversight.

Karadzic was originally indicted by the court in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity until his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrest Monday</a> [JURIST report]. Karadzic&#39;s defense has three days to appeal the extradition, but if unsucessful, he will be sent to the Netherlands where counsel will be appointed and he will be given the opportunity to enter a plea on the charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Karadzic is accused of being involved in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.  His capture has been a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1275e.htm">major goal of the ICTY</a> [press release], and follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">June arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb police commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/stojan_zupljanin_176.html">Stojan Zupljanin</a> [Trial Watch profile].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers and professors <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_072408.html">testified</a> [hearing materials] before the House of Representatives <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">Committee on the Judiciary</a> [official website] Thursday that the government process used to arrest and convict illegal immigrants in Iowa in May was illegal and violated the immigrants&#39; due process rights. In May, <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] officials raided an <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] meatpacking plant in Iowa and arrested 389 illegal immigrant workers. Over four days, 270 of those arrested were each <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/080515waterloo.htm">sentenced to five months in prison</a> [ICE press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">report</a>] and 27 more received probation after pleading guilty to the use of false immigration documents. Following the sentencing, a <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/24immig.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5065&partner=MYWAY&adxnnlx=1211631217-8ET1vBpRQKa9AU0yQaz5Vg">report</a> [text] suggested that it was uncommon for illegal immigrants to face criminal prosecution as opposed to civil charges and deportation. During the Committee hearing Thursday, <a href="http://www.aila.org/">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a> (AILA) [advocacy website] vice-president David Wolfe Leopold reiterated the group&#39;s previous <a href="http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=25499">criticism</a> [letter, PDF] of the convictions process, <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Leopold080724.pdf">saying</a> [testimony, PDF]: <blockquote>A prosecutor&#8217;s professional, moral, and ethical duty is to do justice, not merely to convict. This cardinal principal was ignored by the government in its zeal to criminalize undocumented workers. In essence, the expedited justice or &quot;Fast Tracking&quot; system concocted by the government, with the willing assistance of the US District Court for the Northern District of Iowa, was a conviction / deportation assembly line which could not be burdened with protecting the fundamental rights of the defendants, mostly poor uneducated Guatemalan farmers.</blockquote> Interpreter Erik Camayd-Freixas also <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Camayd-Freixas080724.pdf">criticized the system</a> [testimony, PDF], saying that the immigrants were unable to understand their rights, the charges against them, or the plea bargains to which many finally agreed. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/24/AR2008072403422.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Representatives from both the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Rhodes080724.pdf">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Forman080724.pdf">ICE</a> [testimony transcripts, PDF] defended the government&#39;s arrest and conviction processes, saying that the immigrants&#39; constitutional rights were strictly applied. In general, US immigration prosecutions continued to increase in March 2008, jumping nearly 50 percent from the previous month and nearly 75 percent from the previous year, according to a <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/188/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/whatsnew/email.080617.html">press release</a>] released by the <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/">Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse</a> (TRAC) [official website] at Syracuse University.  Federal immigration prosecutions have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-prosecutions-of-illegal-immigrants.php">risen since February</a> [JURIST report], when such prosecutions hit a record high.  TRAC attributed the increase to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/06/02/GR2008060200068.html">Operation Streamline</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> backgrounder], a joint federal program under which federal prosecutors levy minor charges against illegal immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/index.shtml">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] Chairman Barney Frank (D-MA) said during a Committee <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/hr072508.shtml">hearing</a> [materials] Friday that providing inducements to those who hold liens was the only practical legislative solution to the country&#39;s so-called &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse,&quot; and that House legislation passed Wednesday will effectively provide those inducements. The <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-3221">Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 </a> [HR 3221 materials; House debate <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=206521-1">video</a>, flash] provides for government grants allowing municipalities to buy and redevelop foreclosed properties, and would allow the federal government to provide additional financial backing to the publicly supported <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> [corporate websites] mortgage companies. The bill <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-house-approves-foreclosure-bill-with.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 272-152, and Frank said it is expected to be approved by the Senate later this week. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) supported the legislation during Friday&#39;s hearing but also stressed her support of the proposed <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-5679">Foreclosure Prevention and Sound Mortgage Servicing Act of 2008</a> [HR 5679 materials and text], which would require mortgage lenders to offer loss-mitigation programs for mortgagees in danger of foreclosure. She said that without the imposition of such a statutory duty on lenders, consumers would have little leverage and protection against predatory lending.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/meetings/2008/20080714/draftfedreg.pdf">approved new rules for home mortgage loans</a> [draft regulations, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-reserve-board-approves.php">report</a>] designed to reduce unfair lending practices and increase consumer protection. In June, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] announced that more than <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mortgagefraud061908.htm">400 people had been indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/fbi-names-more-than-400-in-mortgage.php">report</a>] for fraud involving individual mortgages and the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] announced the <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/dealbook/cioffi_indictment.pdf">indictments</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2008/2008jun19.html">press release</a>] of two senior hedge fund managers at <a href="http://www.bearstearns.com/">Bear Stearns</a> [corporate website] for allegedly misleading investors even after they knew their mortgage-related funds were at serious risk of collapse.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cofad1.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruled Thursday that a <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/02319.htm&Title=13&DocType=ARS">2005 state law</a> [text] aimed at prosecuting smugglers hired to ferry illegal immigrants across the border into the US can also be used to prosecute the illegal immigrants.   The judge rejected arguments that the law infringed on the powers of the federal government to regulate immigration.  The law had been used by Maricopa County authorities to prosecute illegal immigrants as members of a conspiracy for their own border crossing, despite comments by law co-author <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/MembersPage.asp?Member_ID=44&Legislature=48">Arizona state Rep. Jonathan Paton</a> [official website] that it was not intended for that purpose.  Capitol Media Services has <a href="http://www.douglasdispatch.com/articles/2008/07/24/news/doc4880f13ad9443652746115.txt">more</a>.<br /><br />Illegal immigration has long been a controversial topic in the border state of Arizona.  In June, the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/">Arizona State Legislature</a> [official website] passed <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/48leg/2r/bills/hb2677h.pdf">legislation</a> [HB 2677, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/arizona-legislature-bars-state.php">report</a>]  barring the state from implementing the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/48leg/2r/bills/hb2677h.pdf">REAL ID Act of 2005</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=real+id">news archive</a>]. In April, two rights groups <a href="http://www.bibdaily.com/pdfs/Lopez-Valenzuela%204-4-08.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/rights-groups-challenge-arizona-illegal.php">report</a>] in the US District Court for the District of Arizona challenging the constitutionality of Arizona&#39;s <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/47leg/1r/bills/hcr2028s.pdf">Proposition 100</a> [PDF text], which denies bail to illegal immigrants accused of committing serious felonies.  Last year, a coalition of civil rights groups filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/valledelsol_v_goddard_complaint.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/rights-groups-file-new-challenge-to.php">report</a>] challenging an Arizona law aimed at preventing employers from knowingly hiring <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/">London High Court </a> [official website] on Thursday ordered a British man to pay approximately $44,000 in damages for creating a fake profile on social networking website <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?factsheet">Facebook</a> [corporate website] and posting defaming information about an acquaintance, Mathew Firsht. The judge found that the postings were libelous regarding both Firsht and a business he operates, and that factual personal information included on the page violated his privacy.  Because posting false information is fairly easy and false profiles are commonly found on many social networking sites, people may not realize that what they are doing could have legal consequences under defamation laws. A lawyer for Firsht said she hopes the ruling will set a new accountability standard. AP has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25840728/wid/11915829?GT1=40006">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7523128.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last week, Facebook&nbsp;<a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/california/candce/5:2008cv03468/205349/">filed a copyright infringement claim</a> [case materials] against a German competitor in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. Facebook accused <a href="http://www.studivz.net/Newsroom">StudiVZ</a> [corporate website, in German] of copying the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the American version of Facebook, saying that StudiVZ&#39;s success is largely due to this imitation.  StudiVZ <a href="http://www.presseportal.de/pm/62589/1231821/studivz_ltd">filed a petition</a> [press release, in German; <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,24049827-5014239,00.html">News.com</a> report] in a German court on Sunday, calling the lawsuit baseless and seeking a declaration of non-infringement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, a California judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN2034220420080720">granted a motion</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-enforces-facebook-trade.php">report</a>] to enforce an intellectual property settlement agreement between Facebook and <a href="http://www.connectu.com/">ConnectU</a> [corporate website]. The ruling effectively ended the two companies&#39; <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/california/candce/5:2007cv01389/189975/">ongoing legal battle</a> [case materials] concerning ownership of source code forming the basis of Facebook.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-127/08">ruled</a> [case materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080057en.pdf">press release</a>] on Friday that the right of EU citizens to live in any EU member state also extends to non-citizen spouses and relatives.  Four Irish couples brought the case, appealing deportation orders issued by the <a href="http://www.justice.ie/">Irish Ministry of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</a> [official website] because one member of each couple was not a legal citizen of any EU country.  The court found that <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/doc_centre/citizenship/movement/doc/table_correspondence_en.pdf">Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament</a> [PDF text] guarantees that foreign nationals married to EU citizens can live in their spouses&#39; home countries: <blockquote>It must also be pointed out that Articles 5, 6(2) and 7(2) of Directive 2004/38 confer the rights of entry, of residence for up to three months, and of residence for more than three months in the host Member State on nationals of non-member countries who are family members of a Union citizen whom they accompany or join in that Member State, without any reference to the place or conditions of residence they had before arriving in that Member State.<br /></blockquote>  EUobserver has <a href="http://euobserver.com/9/26547">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, the ECJ dismissed an <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-540/03">action</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/eu-high-court-says-states-can-limit.php">report</a>] filed by the European Parliament challenging an <a href="http://www.ecre.org/files/frdirective.pdf">EU Council Directive</a> [2003/86/EC text] that allows member states to apply national legislation to family reunification. The opinion held that allowing member states to use a limited amount of discretion in determining requirements for family reunification is a proper balancing test that does not violate the right to respect for family life of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text].  The ruling was seen as a victory for EU member nations who wanted more control over immigration, an increasingly controversial subject in France, the Netherlands, and other states. The ruling permits countries to consider their capacity to accept more immigrants as one factor in whether a family should be allowed to reunite with a child already present in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Maryland judge Thursday rejected a challenge seeking to remove a referendum on a <a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/council/pdf/bill/2007/23-07.pdf">transgender anti-discrimination law</a> [Bill 23-07 text] from the November ballot.  Circuit Court Judge Robert A. Greenberg ruled that the <a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/eletmpl.asp?url=/Content/Elections/index.asp">Montgomery County Board of Elections</a> [official website] had miscalculated the number of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/09/AR2008070901774.html?hpid=moreheadlines">signatures</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] that  <a href="http://www.notmyshower.net/">proponents</a> [Maryland Citizens for Responsible Government website] needed to gather before the referendum could be certified.  However, Greenberg also found that the challenge filed by transgender rights advocates <a href="http://www.equalitymaryland.org/">Equality Maryland</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.equalitymaryland.org/pr_2008/pr2008.04.24.htm">press release</a>] had missed the filing deadline to have the initiative removed from the ballot.  The <a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/csltmpl.asp?url=/content/council/index.asp">County Council</a> unanimously approved the measure last year, and it was subsequently signed into law by <a href="http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/govtmpl.asp?url=/content/exec/welcome.asp">County Executive Isiah Leggett</a> [official websites].  AP has <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=1414315&nid=25">more</a>.  The <I>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/24/AR2008072402561.html?hpid=sec-metro">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/actions/SL071608.PDF">rejected</a> [conference actions list, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/california-court-rejects-challenge-to.php">report</a>] without comment a <a href="http://data.lambdalegal.org/in-court/downloads/bennett_ca_b_20080620_writ-petiton-memorandum-points-and-authorities.pdf">challenge</a>  [petition, PDF] seeking to remove a November ballot initiative that would ban same-sex marriage in that state.  The petition, filed by <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=4026385">Equality California</a>, the <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a>, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites], argued that the amendment would deprive same-sex couples of fundamental rights.  If approved by voters, the <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf">California Marriage Protection Act</a> [ballot materials, PDF; <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/index.php">proposition website</a>] would amend the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">state constitution</a> [text] to read, &quot;Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.&quot;  That ballot initiative comes in reaction to a May 15 California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">report</a>] overturning a ban on same-sex marriage in the state.  In May, the California <a href="http://ww2.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/birthdeathmar/Pages/default.aspx">Office of Vital Records</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-to-begin-issuing-same-sex.php">memorandum</a> [JURIST report] setting June 17 as the start day for issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The court&#39;s May 15 decision stemmed from San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom&#39;s 2004 decision to <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/first-us-gay-marriage-performed-in-san.htm">issue marriage licenses to 4,000 same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Argentine court sentenced former general <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/tort/ejercito/menendez/">Luciano Benjamin Menendez</a> [Project Disappeared profile] and four others to life in prison on Thursday for the 1977 kidnapping, torture, and killing of four political dissidents during the country&#39;s so-called <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">&quot;Dirty War&quot;</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war+argentina">news archive</a>]. Three others have been sentenced to extended jail terms since the case <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/argentina-court-puts-ex-army-commander.php">went to trial in May</a> [JURIST report]. Menendez, who commanded the secret prison <a href="http://www.humanrights-geneva.info/Argentina-17-La-Perla-Survivors,1400">&quot;La Perla&quot;</a> [HRT backgrounder] for the country&#39;s military dictatorship during the late 1970s, was originally taken into custody in 2005 when a judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/argentina-judge-orders-former-military.php">ordered his arrest</a> [JURIST report] in connection with a separate murder. Menendez, now 81, requested continued house arrest, but his request was denied. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQfXislBKc9De2GYHtH1Smw2BPCgD924KJUO0">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Buenos Aires Herald</font> has <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/argentina/note.jsp?idContent=513859&hideIntro=true">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the Argentine government&#39;s campaign against suspected dissidents during the country&#39;s &quot;Dirty War.&quot; In 2005, Argentina&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">struck down amnesty laws</a> [JURIST report] adopted in the 1980s to protect potential defendants, prompting the government to reopen hundreds of human rights cases. In March, Argentinean politician and former police chief Luis Abelardo Patti was also <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/argentina-police-arrest-former-police.php">arrested</a> for crimes allegedly committed during the period. In May, Juan Evaristo Puthod, a victim of the violent suppression, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/missing-argentina-dirty-war-witness.php">kidnapped but later released</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] before testifying in a third case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website]  <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=06-4175_024.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Thursday that a 2002 reapportionment of voting boundaries in the city of <a href="http://www.aurora-il.org/index.php">Aurora, Illinois</a> [official website] did not violate the <a href="http://www.fairvote.org/?page=1327">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro.htm">backgrounder</a>].  The plaintiffs in <u>Gonzalez v. City of Aurora</u> unsuccessfully <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=06-4175_023.mp3">argued</a> [oral argument audio] that having two Hispanic aldermen out of a total of twelve is insufficient representation for the city, which has a 32.6% Hispanic population.  The plaintiffs advocated a redistricting plan to redraw the boundaries of three of the city&#39;s wards in order to achieve a 70% Hispanic concentration, which they said would ensure the election of a Latino candidate.  The court analyzed the language of the VRA, relying on a <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/supreme-court-leaves-texas.php">US Supreme Court decision</a> [JURIST report] for guidance:<blockquote>Section 2 requires an electoral process &#8220;equally open&#8221; to all, not a process that favors one group over another. One cannot maximize Latino influence without minimizing some other group&#8217;s influence. A map drawn to advantage Latino candidates at the expense of black (or white ethnic) candidates violates &sect;2 as surely as a map drawn to maximize the influence of those groups at the expense of Latinos.<br /><br />The Supreme Court emphasized in <u>League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry</u>, its most recent &sect;2 redistricting case, that the Voting Rights Act protects the rights of individual voters, not the rights of groups.<br /><br />What we can see from the record suggests that Latinos are not concentrated enough to support three &#8220;Latino effective&#8221; districts without serious gerrymandering... In other words, the Latino population is not concentrated in a way that neutrally drawn compact districts would produce three &#8220;Latino effective&#8221; wards.</blockquote>Recently the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] upheld a major provision in the 2006 reauthorization of the VRA. In May, the court&#39;s <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1384-133">decision</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-court-upholds-key-voting-rights.php">report</a>] in <u>Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Gonzales</u> [DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/briefs/nwaustin_reply.pdf">brief</a>, PDF] upheld the validity of Section 5 of the VRA, which required states or towns with histories of racial discrimination to get <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] or court approval prior to making changes with their election procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Ecuador&#39;s special assembly charged with rewriting the nation&#39;s <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/ecuador98.html">constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] provisionally approved a new constitution on Thursday. The draft <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=389&sid=1445924">includes unprecedented measures</a> [AP report] giving the president the power to remove Congress in the first three years of a four-year term, to control monetary policy, and to seek re-election for an additional four year term.  <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/">Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa</a> [official website, in Spanish; <a href="http://www.rafaelcorrea.com/">personal website</a>], who has led the call for constitutional reform, has pushed for <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/ecuador-president-elect-promises.php">restraints on powerful political parties</a> [JURIST report], freedom from foreign influence, increased governmental accountability, and regional - rather than national - elections.  Critics fear that Correa will follow the example set by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-opposition-criticizes.php">report</a>] in using the reforms to expand his presidential powers.  The new constitution must pass in a national referendum before it can take effect.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7524680.stm">more</a>.  <br /><br />The approval comes more than a year after a national referendum where voters overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/ecuador-electoral-tribunal-confirms.php">approved measures for constitutional reform</a> [JURIST report], including establishing the Constitutional Assembly.  Correa <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-president-pledges-new.php">pledged to rewrite the country&#39;s constitution</a> [JURIST report] following his leftist coalition&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ecuador-ruling-coalition-wins-majority.php">landslide victory</a> [JURIST report] in Constitutional Assembly elections in October 2007.  Correa&#39;s <a href="http://www.rafaelcorrea.com/plandegobierno.php">Alianza PAIS party</a> [official website, in Spanish] has a majority in the Constitutional Assembly, holding 80 out of 130 seats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Senegal+">Senegal</a> [JURIST news archive] has formally adopted a constitutional amendment giving the nation&#39;s courts jurisdiction over the trial of former Chadian dictator <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">Hissene Habre</a> [HRW materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>], according to a Thursday <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/23/senega19438.htm">statement</a> [text] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The group expressed doubt that the nation has the political will to prosecute Habre, who has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. Habre has been living is Senegal since he was deposed from Chad in 1990, and the Senegalese courts <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">dismissed an action against him in 2001</a> [HRW case backgrounder], claiming that they lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere.  In April, the National Assembly of Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/senegal-amends-constitution-to-allow.php">approved the amendment</a> [JURIST report] giving Senegalese courts jurisdiction over Habre&#39;s trial.  Also Thursday, Senegalese Justice Minister M. Madick&eacute; Niang said that three judges and two prosecutors had been appointed to the Habre case after a coalition of  human rights groups last month <a href="http://www.fidh.org/spip.php?article5673">criticized Senegal for delays</a> [statement, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/senegal-criticized-for-delaying.php">report</a>] in prosecution.  Radio Netherlands has <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/internationaljustice/specials/Universal/080723-habre">more</a>.  News24 has <a href="http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2362958,00.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Senegal courts have long <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite the issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] by Belgium pursuant to its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure to either try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">try him in Senegal</a> [Africa Union report] and the government later <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/habre-will-face-trial-in-domestic.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. In January, an EU official sent to Senegal to advise the court where a trial should take place reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/no-senegal-trial-of-former-chad.php">trial would not begin in 2008</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile] filed a <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/july/UBS.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against financial firm <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] on Thursday for allegedly misrepresenting so-called &quot;auction rate securities&quot; as low-risk despite the actual volatility of such investments. In the complaint, Cuomo alleges that UBS led investors to believe they could easily divest themselves of the long-term securities, and that after the company was aware of market instability, they continued to push the funds even though top executives had moved quickly to sell their own holdings. During a press conference on the lawsuit, Coumo <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/july/july24a_08.html">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Not only is UBS guilty of committing a flagrant breach of trust between the bank and its customers, its top executives jumped ship as soon the securities market started to collapse, leaving thousands of customers holding the bag. Today we bring the first nationwide lawsuit against UBS, seeking to recover billions of dollars for customers and sending a resounding message to the rest of the industry that this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated.</blockquote>Cuomo is seeking to force UBS to buy back the securities from investors and to pay restitution for any profits made from their sale, as well as other damages. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-y98HpCb4WYTMyyaxm39eS8SMRg">more</a>.<br /><br />On Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.ssb.state.tx.us/">Texas Securities Board</a> [official website] <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUKN2331394020080723">said</a> [Reuters report] it is considering banning UBS from selling securities in the state because of auction rate securities misrepresentations. A March <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09gret.html?_r=2&ref=business&oref=slogin&oref=slogin">report</a> [text] said the practice of representing the securities as low-risk and highly liquid was widespread and has resulted in large loses and a number of lawsuits around the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced Thursday that he has appointed South African judge <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/chambers/judges/Pillay_Navanethem.html">Navanethem Pillay</a> [ICC profile] as the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, replacing <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-rights-chief-announces-june.php">departing commissioner Louise Arbour</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay, a former judge of the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) and a current appeals chamber judge on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites], began her legal career in 1967 when she became the first woman to open a law practice in the Natal province of South Africa. Initially known for her work defending anti-apartheid activists, she successfully fought to guarantee the legal representation rights of South African political prisoners, including <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1993/mandela-bio.html">Nelson Mandela</a> [Nobel Prize profile]. In 1995, she became the first woman of Southeast-Asian descent appointed to the <a href="http://www.law.wits.ac.za/sca/">South African Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The appointment will now go to the 192-member General Assembly, which will meet on Monday, for approval.  AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080724/wl_africa_afp/unrightssafrica_080724173424">more</a>.  The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27480&Cr=&Cr1=">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In March, Arbour said she would <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/93BC9965C20451A2C1257405004A919F?opendocument">not seek a second term</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-rights-chief-confirms-plans-to-step.php">report</a>] when her commission ended on June 30.  Arbour was <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/breaking-news-new-un-rights-chief-is.htm">appointed</a> [JURIST report] to her position in 2004 after five years as a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. She succeeded <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2146395.stm">Sergio Vieira de Mello</a> [BBC obituary], who was killed in a 2003 suicide bomb attack on UN offices in Baghdad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials at the US Chamber of Commerce&#39;s affiliate, the <a href="http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/index.cfm">Institute for Legal Reform</a> (ILR) [official website], said in a <a href="http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/issues/docload.cfm?docId=1213">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/media/pressreleases/20080724.cfm">press release</a>] released Thursday that the system of heavy securities class action litigation in the US is inefficient, unnecessary, and harmful to the US economy. The report says that the current securities class action system forces companies to settle with plaintiffs rather than risk trial, and that it most benefits trial lawyers while harming companies and failing to protect consumers: <blockquote>This flawed system is not needed to monitor and punish securities fraud: the ample regulatory, civil, and criminal enforcement powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, their state counterparts, and financial services self-regulatory organizations more effectively deter wrongdoers and compensate shareholders without the inefficiencies of the class action litigation system.</blockquote> ILR suggested Congressional action to fix the system, such as increasing litigation oversight and transparency through the enactment of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.5491.IH:">Securities Litigation Attorney Accountability and Transparency Act</a> [text and materials], which was been introduced in the House of Representatives, and by reforming the discovery and appeals processes. Legal Newsline has <a href="http://www.legalnewsline.com/news/214347-expert-private-securities-lawsuits-hurt-economy">more</a>.<br /><br />The report specifically highlighted the recent related legal troubles of securities firm <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Milberg+Weiss">Milberg Weiss</a> [JURIST news archive]. Prosecutors alleged that since 1984, the firm had paid up to $11.3 million in bribes to people who agreed to serve as lead plaintiffs in class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits and were promised 10 percent of the attorney fees eventually received by the firm. In April, Reuters reported that partner Melvyn Weiss&#39; former law firm, now known as Milberg LLP, had <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/milberg-llp-in-settlement-talks-over.php">entered into negotiations</a> [JURIST report] with federal prosecutors to settle accusations. Three people <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/california-lawyer-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> in connection with the bribery agreement in May 2006 after a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/leading-class-action-law-firm-partners.php">indicted</a> [JURIST reports] the firm.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://indian.senate.gov/public/">Senate Indian Affairs Committee</a> [official website] on Thursday held <a href="rtsp://video.webcastcenter.com/srs_g2/indian072408.rm?start=">hearings</a> [RM Video; hearing <a href="http://indian.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Hearing&Hearing_ID=1b54b727-82f0-4bf1-902a-278e78572cdd">materials</a>] on a bill designed to give Native American courts and law enforcement broader authority to combat violent and sex-related crimes. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) and 12 co-sponsors introduced the <a href="http://dorgan.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=301170">Tribal Law and Order Act</a> [press release] on Wednesday.  If passed, the bill would give American Indian courts authority to impose stricter sentences, expand the courts&#39; jurisdiction to cover more non-Indian suspects, and provide for additional law enforcement training and federal cooperation in addressing the crimes. In a <a href="http://indian.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Hearings.Testimony&Hearing_ID=1b54b727-82f0-4bf1-902a-278e78572cdd&Witness_ID=bb578120-7854-4872-aaac-b963c2300b24">prepared statement</a> [PDF text] for the hearing,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.naicja.org/">National American Indian Court Judges Association</a> [association website] Vice President Roman Duran commented:<blockquote>Tribal courts agonize over the very same issues state and federal courts confront in the criminal context, such as, assault and battery, predatory crimes, hate crimes, child sexual abuse, alcohol and substance abuse, gang violence, violence against women, and now methamphetamine along with the social ills that are left in its wake.  These courts, however, while striving to address these complex issues with far fewer financial resources than their federal and state counterparts must also &#8220;strive to respond competently and creatively to federal and state pressures coming from the outside, and to cultural values and imperatives from within.&#8221; ... Judicial training that addresses the present imperatives posed by the public safety crisis in Indian Country, while also being culturally sensitive, is essential for tribal courts to be effective in deterring crime in their communities.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.grandforksherald.com/ap/index.cfm?page=view&id=D923QTUG7">more</a>.<br /><br />In April 2007, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/maze/report.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] saying that Native American women are at much higher risk of becoming victims of violent and sexual crimes than are women of other ethnicities. The report, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/maze_1yr.pdf">updated earlier this year</a> [PDF text], blamed lack of tribal judicial authority and weak law enforcement for the disparity.  Amnesty <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?lang=e&id=ENGUSA20080723004">praised</a> [press release] the introduction of the Senate bill on Wednesday, and the group maintains an <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/maze">archive</a> [advocacy website] dedicated to the issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An immigration policy reform group Wednesday called on the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/">Northern California US Attorney&#39;s Office</a> [official website] to take over a murder investigation involving an illegal immigrant who previously avoided deportation under a 2007 San Francisco <a href="http://www.bayswan.org/sftraffick/SFcityrefuge.html">sanctuary ordinance</a> [City of Refuge Ordinance text; <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp?id=78378">press release</a>].  <a href="http://www.capsweb.org/">Californians for Population Stabilization</a> (CAPS) [advocacy website] accused San Francisco of being <a href="http://www.capsweb.org/content.php?id=413&menu_id=8&menu_item_id=28">&quot;repeatedly irresponsible&quot;</a> [press release] in its handling of the case of Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant who allegedly shot three people earlier this month. CAPS also said that the city had shown itself generally unwilling to prosecute illegal immigrants. Ramos&#39; case has drawn attention from national lawmakers as well.  In a Tuesday <a href="http://tancredo.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=1377">letter</a> [text], <a href="http://tancredo.house.gov/default.aspx">Rep. Tom Tancredo</a> (R-CO) called on <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael Mukasey</a> [official websites] to launch an investigation into the matter:<blockquote>Because San Francisco&#8217;s political leaders have already demonstrated their willingness to act in flagrant violation of federal law, I do not believe that local judicial institutions can be trusted to fairly try the case or mete out an appropriate punishment.  Instead, I hope that the federal government will consider stepping in to prosecute the case in much the same way the federal government was forced to intercede during the civil rights period when southern states refused to follow the law or protect the rights of African-Americans.</blockquote> Tancredo later continued: <blockquote>I suggest that you direct US Attorneys to take decisive action against cities like San Francisco who maintain these dangerous and illegal sanctuary policies. Federal action now might discourage the next potential terrorist or murderer from taking advantage of these local &quot;catch and release&quot; policies that all too often allow them to continue victimizing other American citizens.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25827381/">more</a>.<br /><br />Last year, <a href="http://www.sfgov.org/site/mayor_index.asp">San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/san-francisco-mayor-to-maintain-citys.php">pledged to keep the city a haven for immigrants</a> [JURIST report], saying that while he could not stop US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] agents from making arrests, he would try to keep them from conducting immigrations raids. In April 2007, thousands of protesters <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/thousands-march-in-la-against-new-white.php">marched in Los Angeles</a> [JURIST report] against President George W. Bush&#39;s proposal to grant citizenship to the more than 12 million illegal immigrants in the US. The <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/immigration/files/white_house_republican_immigration_principles.pdf">proposal</a> [PDF text] would have allowed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST news archive] to apply for work visas, but at the expiration of the visa, immigrants would have been required to return to their home countries to apply for citizenship.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1276e-summary.htm">convicted</a> [judgment summary; <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1276e.htm">press release</a>] a Kosovar journalist on contempt of court charges and fined him 7,000 euros for revealing the identity of a witness in the war crimes trial of <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/ramush_haradinaj_322.html">former Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj</a> [TrialWatch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haradinaj">news archive</a>]. <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/cis-haxhiu.pdf">Baton Haxhiu</a> [ICTY case sheet, PDF] was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/haradinaj/haxhiu/order-e/080520a.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icty-indicts-journalist-for-exposing.php">report</a>] on the charges and pleaded not guilty in May. The judgment summary, read aloud by the judge following the trial, notes: <blockquote>In his interview with the Prosecution, the Accused agreed and admitted that it was against the law to publish the name of the Witness and that he had violated &quot;the rule of the Tribunal&quot; by publishing it. The Accused added that because the Witness&#8217;s name was known in Kosovo by a select group of people, he published the Witness&#8217;s name to protect the Witness because the Tribunal had failed to do so. In this respect, the Chamber considered that individuals, including journalists, cannot decide to publish information in defiance of protective measures orders, on the basis of their own assessment of the public interest in that information.</blockquote> Haxhiu must pay the full fine amount by November 24. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL24557299">more</a>.<br /><br />Haradinaj was a senior commander of the KLA, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force that opposed <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder]. He was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/har-ii050224e.htm">indicted</a> [initial indictment, PDF] by ICTY prosecutors in 2005. Haradinaj was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in April, but former Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte&#8217;s claims of witness intimidation have brought the proceedings under scrutiny. Prosecutors are now appealing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A lawyer for Bosnian Serb leader and former fugitive <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] on Thursday threatened to sue several unknown persons whom he alleges kidnapped Karadzic last week.  Serbian officials have said that Karadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested on Monday</a> [JURIST report], but Karadzic disputes that date, saying he was first captured on Friday and then detained in an unknown location over the weekend.  Also Thursday, a spokesman for the <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">Serbian war crimes prosecutor</a> [official website] vowed to find the people responsible for helping Karadzic evade capture for the past 12 years.  Karadzic currently awaits extradition to the Hague to face <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">war crimes charges</a> [amended indictment] before the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official site].  AP has <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=105&sid=1444313">more</a>.<br /><br />Karadzic was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">originally indicted</a> [text] by the ICTY in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity until his arrest. Karadzic is accused of being involved in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. His capture has been a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1275e.htm">major goal of the ICTY</a> [press release], and follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">June arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb police commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/stojan_zupljanin_176.html">Stojan Zupljanin</a> [Trial Watch profile].  Former ICTY Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile] frequently criticized Serbia for its seeming reluctance to cooperate with the ICTY, exemplified by its failure to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-must-do-more-to-arrest-war.php">find and capture</a> [JURIST report] remaining war crimes suspects such as Karadzic. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bioInvest.html">Serge Brammertz</a> [ICC profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-security-council-approves-brammertz.php">report</a>] became Chief Prosecutor in January, saying that he would continue his predecessor&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/new-icty-prosecutor-towing-del-ponte.php">tough stance on Serbian cooperation</a> [JURIST report] with the tribunal. Brammertz has vowed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/new-icty-prosecutor-vows-to-try-all-war.php">try all war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report] before the expiration of the ICTY&#39;s mandate in 2010.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday held that the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h418eh.txt.pdf">REAL ID Act of 2005</a>&nbsp;(RIDA) [PDF, text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=real+id">news archive</a>] gives a &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; for judicial review to those aliens whose removal orders became final before RIDA entered into effect.  Prior to RIDA&#39;s enactment, aliens convicted of crimes in the US could request judicial review <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2241.html">through <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petitions</a> [28 USC s. 2241 text], which were not subject to time restraints. Under the terms of RIDA, though, such aliens can only obtain review by filing petitions with a federal court of appeals within 30 days after the court issues a final order of removal.  The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/471B69E75C765C8E8825748F0048292D/$file/0574817.pdf?openelement">held</a> [PDF, opinion] <blockquote>RIDA fundamentally changed the system of judicial review for criminal aliens, withdrawing <em>habeas corpus</em> from the district courts and restoring jurisdiction in the courts of appeals. Congress did not, however, amend the 30-day timely filing requirement, indicating that Congress still expected aliens to act quickly to preserve their rights.</blockquote>Initially drafted after the Sept.11, 2001 attacks and designed to discourage illegal immigration, RIDA attempts to make it more difficult for terrorists to fraudulently obtain US driver&#39;s licenses and other government IDs by mandating that states require birth certificates or similar documentation and also consult national immigration databases before issuing IDs. After controversy and <a href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/ramasastry/20050810.html">strenuous opposition from civil libertarians</a> [FindLaw commentary], it finally <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/real-id-act-heads-to-senate-after.php">passed in 2005</a> [JURIST report] as part of an emergency supplemental appropriations defense spending bill. State lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/state-lawmakers-predict-problems-with.php">previously expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about possible problems expected to accompany the implementation of RIDA, fearing that they would not be able to comply with the law&#39;s requirements before the May 2008 deadline. In March 2007, Homeland Security responded to these concerns by <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/homeland-security-extends-real-id.php">extending the deadline for compliance by 18 months</a>. All states have since been <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/real-id-act-extension-granted-to-all-50.php">granted compliance extensions</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) [official website] argued on Wednesday that it should be immune from lawsuits brought by <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive] evacuees who claim they were injured by toxic fumes released by emergency trailers provided by the agency. FEMA made the argument before the US <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/GENERAL/General.htm">District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], which is hearing one of a number of trailer-related lawsuits brought against the agency. An attorney for the plaintiffs said FEMA should be held liable for issuing trailers that did not satisfy federal safety codes, and a firm representing clients in a similar case has <a href="http://www.yourlawyer.com/topics/overview/toxic_fema_trailers">said</a> [firm materials] that <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts111.html">formaldehyde</a> [CDC materials] levels in some trailers were as much as 70 times higher than safe levels.  A US Attorney representing FEMA argued that only Congress has the authority to address possible governmental&nbsp;negligence in the situation. Plaintiffs in the case are also seeking class-action status for the lawsuit. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iuGq6yeUvlwsIsXQiT3Qx23gcpswD923O56O0">more</a>.<br /><br />FEMA has acknowledged a Center for Disease Control (CDC) <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080214b.htm">report</a>&nbsp;finding unsafe formaldehyde levels in many of the trailers, but has issued a <a href="http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=44961">statement</a> [press releases] saying it did not know of the problems at the time the trailers were purchased and assuring the public that it has taken steps to remedy the problem. Earlier this month, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee began <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2069">hearings</a> [hearing materials; <font style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</font> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/08/AR2008070802315.html?hpid=sec-nation">report</a>] into the both the government&#39;s and manufacturers&#39; actions relating to the unhealthy trailers.

The court held that another provision requiring all students to stand, even if excused from reciting the Pledge, violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment of the US Constitution</a> [text], and is therefore not enforceable.  Stressing that the case involved the protection of parental rights rather than those of children, the court stated: <blockquote>[T]he refusal of students to participate in the Pledge -- unless their parents consent -- hinders their parents&#39; fundamental right to control their children&#39;s upbringing. The rights of students and the rights of parents -- two different sets of persons whose opinions can often clash -- are the subject of a legislative balance in the statute before us. The State, in restricting the student&#39;s freedom of speech, advances the protection of the constitutional rights of parents: an interest which the State may lawfully protect.</blockquote> AP has <a href="http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/251/story/379900.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In June 2006, a federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-florida.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the Florida law as unconstitutional, citing <a href="http://www.justia.us/us/319/624/case.html">West Virginia v. Barnette</a> [opinion, PDF], a 1943 United States Supreme Court decision holding that students have a constitutional right not to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  In the 2004 Supreme Court case <a href="http://www.justia.us/us/542/02-1624/case.html">Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow</a> [opinion, PDF], three concurring justices <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-dismisses.htm">affirmed the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of public-school teachers leading the Pledge of Allegiance in their classrooms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The armed forces of the United Kingdom may have used officially-banned tactics to interrogate detainees in Iraq, according to a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200708/jtselect/jtrights/157/15702.htm">report</a> [text] released Sunday by Parliament&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/joint_committee_on_human_rights.cfm">Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> [official website].  In previous testimony before the committee, top defense officials had denied the use of &quot;wall standing, hooding, subjection to noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink,&quot; all of which were prohibited by the UK government in 1972, but recent evidence discovered during an investigation of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3931023.stm">Baha Mousa</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mousa">news archive</a>] case indicated that those techniques may still be in use.  The committee called for an investigation into allegations that former Minister of State for the Armed Forces <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msp/memberspages/adam_ingram/index.htm">Adam Ingram</a> and <a href="http://www.operations.mod.uk/telic/biogs_old.htm">Lt. Gen. Robin Brims</a> [profiles] may have lied to the committee:<blockquote>The evidence we received from Lieutenant General Brims and Mr Ingram formed the basis for the section of our Report on the UN Convention Against Torture dealing with interrogation techniques. It would appear that this evidence was incorrect and that, as a result, we were unable to give a full account to Parliament of the human rights issues relating to the use of such techniques.<br /><br />We have yet to receive an explanation from the Ministry of Defence for the discrepancies between the evidence given to the Joint Committee in 2004 and 2006 on the use of prohibited conditioning techniques and the facts which have emerged from the Payne court martial and the Aitken report. The issues relating to the death of Baha Mousa are now the subject of a public inquiry. We recommend that, in response to this Report, the Secretary of State for Defence should confirm we will receive a detailed explanation of the discrepancies between the evidence to the Committee by Mr Ingram in 2004 and Lieutenant General Brims in 2006 and the facts which have subsequently emerged concerning the death of Baha Mousa, as soon as possible after the conclusion of the public inquiry.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080727/D9268SI00.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The torture allegations relate to the case of nine Iraqi men who say they were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-high-court-hears-iraq-detainee.php">tortured while detained by British troops</a> [JURIST report] in Basra in 2003.  The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/home">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] reached a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iraq-detainees-to-get-28m-settlement.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the men earlier this month, agreeing to pay &pound;2.83 million in compensation, as well as issue an apology and an admission of liability.  The family of Baha Mousa, a tenth man who died in custody, was also included in the settlement. Seven soldiers faced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_6360000/newsid_6360800/6360845.stm">court-martial</a> [BBC timeline] in connection with Mousa&#39;s death.  Of the seven soldiers charged, only one, Corporal David Payne, faced <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/uk-soldier-jailed-for-abusing-iraqi.php">jail time</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/uk-soldier-first-to-plead-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] to a charge of inhumane treatment. All other charges were <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/uk-court-drops-last-abuse-charges.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2007, lawyers for the Iraqi plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/uk-defense-ministry-withholding-iraqi.php">accused the Ministry of Defence of withholding evidence</a> [JURIST report].  In March, <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/People/Ministers/SecretaryOfStateForDefence.htm">UK Secretary of State for Defence Des Browne</a> [official profile] admitted that British soldiers had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uk-troops-violated-human-rights-of.php">violated the human rights</a> [JURIST report] of the Basra detainees, saying that the MOD would specifically admit to substantive breaches of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF text].

		<title>Eyewitness testimony increasingly unreliable under stress: UK study</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An eyewitness&#39; ability to recall specific details of an incident decreases dramatically in high-stress situations, according to a new <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119426908/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0">study</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.writing.gold.ac.uk/news/pressrelease.php?releaseID=654">press release</a>] that could have long-ranging impact on law enforcement and legal procedures. The study, conducted by Tin Valentine and Jan Mesout of <a href="http://www.writing.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths</a> [academic website], part of the University of London, measured participants&#39; ability to recall details about an actor instructed to jump out at visitors as they moved through a &quot;fun-house&quot; maze. The study found that participants who reported being more stressed during the visit consistently failed to correctly identify specific details about the actor afterwards.<br /><br />The study distinguished between &quot;low stress&quot; situations, which might actually produce a heightened awareness of one&#39;s surroundings, with &quot;high stress&quot; terror, which reduces one&#39;s recall. The researchers noted that the latter form of stress is more often the one experienced by witnesses to crimes. Evidence reform advocates are <a href="http://www.nlada.org/Defender/forensics/for_lib/Index/Eyewitness%20ID#Eyewitness%20ID">already critical of eyewitness testimony</a> [NLADA materials] and some have <a href="http://eyeid.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/new-study-shows-catastrophic-effect-of-stress-on-eyewitness-accuracy/">predicted</a> [advocacy blog] that the study could have major implications for criminal cases that rely on eyewitness testimony.

In March, <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/content/view/215/32/">Chief Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya</a> [official profile, in Turkish] petitioned the court to disband the AKP and bar <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6900616.stm">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6595511.stm">President Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC profiles] from political office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.alhaq.org/pdfs/Al-Haq%20-%20Torturing%20Each%20Other%20-%20Executive%20Summary%20%5BEnglish%5D.pdf">report</a> [executive summary, PDF; <a href="http://www.alhaq.org/etemplate.php?id=384">press release</a>] released Monday by Palestinian human rights group <a href="http://www.alhaq.org/">Al-Haq</a> [advocacy website] indicates that officials for Palestinian security and military agencies frequently detain, torture and mistreat citizens from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The report, released the same day as a similar <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/iopt0708/iopt0708web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/30/isrlpa19482.htm">press release</a>] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], states that most of the arrests and subsequent detainee mistreatment incidents are motivated by tensions between Hamas and Fatah groups, and are not legally valid. In the press release, Al-Haq officials wrote: <blockquote>New trends have included an increase in psychological torture, an increase in arbitrary arrests, and arrests and detention carried out in violation of the Palestinian Basic Law and penal procedural laws. And while government officials have pledged to bring the security forces into line with the law and punish those responsible, the reality on the ground remains bleak. By not taking action against the perpetrators, and in the absence of legitimate and sustained monitoring &#8211; internally and externally &#8211; of their security forces, these officials are encouraging these illegal practices. </blockquote> The group said that the Palestinian government should enact a law prohibiting torture, enact military laws, give the Palestinian High Court oversight powers over the military, enforce external and internal oversight measures, increase accountability, and inform citizens of their rights. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5idUs8l2E-CO42YXbi1x49qteg_6AD926PC5G0">more</a>.<br /><br />Tension in the Palestinian territories has increased lately as competing Palestinian governments controlled by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/profiles/1371998.stm">Fatah</a> in the West Bank and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/978626.stm">Hamas</a> [BBC backgrounders] in Gaza have struggled for power. In May, the <a href="http://www.piccr.org/index.php">Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens&#39; Rights </a> (PICCR) [advocacy website] reported that it had received more than 2,000 reports of human rights abuses by Palestinian factions in 2007, including illegal detentions and torture. In 2007, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/amnesty-criticizes-palestinian-factions.php">criticized the two Palestinian groups</a> [JURIST report] for causing wide-scale violence involving civilians.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian officials on Sunday hanged 29 people in the capital Tehran as part of what the government says was a push to enforce Islamic moral codes. Government sources and local media presented <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/07/26/africa/OUKWD-UK-IRAN-EXECUTION.php">conflicting reports</a> [Reuters report] regarding what crimes those executed had committed, but offenses ranging from adultery to murder qualify for the punishment under the country&#39;s use of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/sharia_1.shtml">Sharia</a> [BBC backgrounder] penal rules. Human rights groups suggested that Iran intended the mass execution to challenge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-stoning.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report] of its death penalty policies. Before Sunday, Iran had reportedly hanged 20 people this year, and human rights groups said that the country executed over 300 people in 2007.  Last week, an additional nine people were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm">sentenced to death by stoning</a> [BBC report] for adultery and sexual offenses, despite a moratorium on the practice imposed by the head of the Iranian judiciary in 2002.  <em>The Times</em> has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article4412670.ece">more</a>.<br /><br />International rights advocates increased pressure on Iran following the stoning execution of a man convicted of adultery in July 2007. Iran quickly announced an <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/iran-to-investigate-judge-who-ordered.php">investigation into the judge</a> [JURIST report] who ordered the execution.  In January, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called on Iran to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/campaigning-end-stoning-iran-20080115">abolish executions by stoning</a> [press release].   Last April, an Amnesty <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE14/014/2007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/iraq-execution-rate-now-worlds-fourth.php">report</a>] named Iran as having one of the three highest execution rates in the world, along with China and Pakistan. Most executions in the country are carried out by hanging and are related to traditional capital crimes including murder and rape, although an Iranian airport customs officer was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp.php">executed for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in January.

Last week, his lawyer threatened to sue Serbian police for <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/genocide-suspect-karadzic-threatens.php">allegedly kidnapping Karadzic</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] before reporting his arrest.&nbsp;BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7528929.stm">more</a>.

Karadzic is accused of being involved in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. His capture has been a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1275e.htm">major goal of the ICTY</a> [press release], and follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">June arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb police commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/stojan_zupljanin_176.html">Stojan Zupljanin</a> [Trial Watch profile].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Newspapers in <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/jul/28/senate-should-approve-federal-shield-law/">Tennessee</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-gant28-2008jul28,0,2263817.story">California</a>, <a href="http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/072808/opinion_2008072800136.shtml">Georgia</a>, and <a href="http://www.morningjournal.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19874088&BRD=1699&PAG=461&dept_id=46368&rfi=6">Ohio</a> [editorials] and several other states carried editorials Monday in support of US Senate passage of a proposed federal <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s2035rs.txt.pdf">reporter shield law</a> [S. 2035 text, PDF; bill <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.02035:">materials</a>], of the law, citing the occasional necessity of source anonymity. The Free Flow of Information Act of 2007 would allow reporters to refuse to reveal their sources during testimony given in federal cases, except when the information is needed to prevent a terrorist act, to protect national security, as eyewitness testimony to a crime, or to prevent other serious crimes. The US House of Representatives passed a similar <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.2102:">bill</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-house-passes-reporter-shield-bill.php">report</a>] in October 2007. The Senate is scheduled to vote on its version before it recesses for the summer, but could vote on the bill as early as this week. <br /><br />Clint Brewer, national president of the <a href="http://www.spj.org/">Society of Professional Journalists</a> (SPJ) [official website] and executive editor of the Nashville City Paper, <a href="http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/news.php?viewStory=61711">wrote</a> [editorial text]: <blockquote>The use of anonymous sources is a very necessary part of the reporting process, and the practice has been the only way some of the biggest stories about government corruption, neglect and corporate abuse have come to light at the hands of the American press. From Watergate to Enron to Walter Reed, story after story shining a light on the ills and wrongs committed in the names of the American people would never have been published without journalists being able to protect anonymous sources.<br /><br />Now, the government in the form of overreaching federal judges and prosecutors is trying to come through reporters to discover leaks of information about the workings of our government &#8212; much of it information every citizen has the right to know. The result is that our country, which should be a beacon for human rights and democracy worldwide, is instead jailing and fining journalists for doing their job, for informing the public about the business of their government.</blockquote> The bill is also supported by <a href="http://www.naa.org/docs/Public-Policy/20080421_akaka.pdf">media companies and organizations</a> [letter, PDF] and <a href="http://www.nppa.org/news_and_events/news/2008/07/shield.html">more than 40 attorneys general</a> [NPPA press release], but the Bush administration has <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/top-bush-administration-officials-speak.php">threatened to veto</a> [JURIST report] the federal shield law, saying it would threaten national security and that its definition of a journalist is too broad.<br /><br />In recent years, the media and the courts have been exploring the extent of reporters&#39; rights to protect their sources. Former <em>USA Today</em> reporter and past JURIST student staff member <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=toni+locy">Toni Locy</a> [JURIST news archive] has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/anthrax-reporter-challenges-contempt-of.php">appealed a contempt of court ruling</a> [JURIST report] for refusing to disclose government sources who provided information about former US Army germ-warfare researcher Dr. Steven J. Hatfill, initially identified as a &quot;person of interest&quot; in the <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~cih/anthraxinfo/public/publicthreat_attacks.htm">2001 anthrax attacks</a> [GWU backgrounder] investigations. In March, US District Judge Reggie Walton found Locy in <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2003cv1793-224">contempt of court</a> [order, PDF] for not disclosing her sources and ordered her to pay a fine of $500 a day, increasing to $1,000 a day after one week and then up to $5,000 a day after two weeks, the costs of which could not be covered by her former employer. Locy obtained an <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-blocks-contempt.php">emergency stay</a> of that order from the Court of Appeals and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/anthrax-reporter-challenges-contempt-of.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] on the merits of the sanctions were heard in May. The appeals court has yet to make a formal ruling on the status of the contempt case in light of Hatfill&#39;s June <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-hatfill-anthrax-settlement-may-moot.php">settlement</a> of his case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of the Philippines reached a peace agreement Monday with rebels from the <a href="http://www.luwaran.com/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3003809.stm">backgrounder</a>], granting expanded boundaries to the country&#39;s southern <a href="http://www.armm.gov.ph/index.php?section=1">Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</a> (ARMM) [official website]. In addition to the recognized size of the region, the two sides say they have also reached <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBB5NIkDpLv3hZA456tIsqbjzASA">tentative agreements</a> [AFP report] on the distribution of mining revenues from the region, a timeline for local elections, and the implementation of new regulations. Shortly after the deal was reached, President <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] urged the country&#39;s lawmakers to push for long-term resolution in the region in her annual <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/sonatext2008.asp">State of the Nation Address</a> (SONA) [text; government <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/">materials</a>]:<blockquote>In our 2006 SONA, our food baskets were identified as North Luzon and Mindanao. The sad irony of Mindanao as food basket is that it has some of the highest hunger in our nation. It has large fields of high productivity, yet also six of our ten poorest provinces. The prime reason is the endless Mindanao conflict. A comprehensive peace has eluded us for half a century. But last night, differences on the tough issue of ancestral domain were resolved. Yes, there are political dynamics among the people of Mindanao. Let us sort them out with the utmost sobriety, patience and restraint. I ask Congress to act on the legislative and political reforms that will lead to a just and lasting peace during our term of office. The demands of decency and compassion urge dialogue. Better talk than fight, if nothing of sovereign value is anyway lost. </blockquote>The agreement, which is expected to be formalized within the next month, will likely postpone August 11 elections scheduled for the region. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7528303.stm">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New <a href="http://www.openeurope.org.uk/research/redc.pdf">poll results</a> [questions and results, PDF; <a href="http://www.openeurope.org.uk/media%2Dcentre/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=81">press release</a>] released Sunday by think tank Open Europe indicate that Irish voters do not support a second referendum on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], formally known as the <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf">text</a>, PDF], and that they would reject the treaty again if the country held another referendum. The Treaty will not take effect until all 27 EU member states approve the new rules, and its future has been uncertain since Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in a June referendum. Open Europe&#39;s poll, which included responses from 1,006 voting-aged Irish, found that 71 percent oppose a second referendum while only 24 percent support one. It also found that if there was a second referendum, 52 percent would vote against it while 32 percent would vote for it. Open Europe Director Neil O&#39;Brien said of the results: <blockquote>Voters don&#39;t feel that Europe&#39;s political class have respected Ireland&#39;s decision. Their response to the referendum result has obviously appeared arrogant to some voters. By appearing to bully the voters, EU politicians are actually driving lots more people into the no camp.</blockquote> Ireland Minister for Foreign Affairs <a href="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/home/index.aspx?id=8596">Miche&aacute;l Martin</a> [official profile] has responded that the poll is an &quot;outside interference&quot; in Ireland&#39;s dialog on the Treaty and said that the government is working on its own referendum study. RT&Eacute; has <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0727/eulisbon.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Several EU members, including <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/spain-senate-ratifies-eu-reform-treaty.php">Spain</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-completes-lisbon-treaty-ratification.php">UK</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/belgium-gives-final-approval-to-eu.php">Belgium</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/netherlands-upper-house-approves-eu.php">Netherlands</a>, have contined the ratification process despite the rejection, while others, including <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/poland-president-refuses-to-sign-eu.php">Poland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/austria-chancellor-to-push-for.php">Austria</a>, have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/european-council-to-discuss-lisbon.php">refused to move forward</a> [JURIST reports] until after an October meeting designed to reconcile the future of the agreement. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/eu-leaders-sign-reform-treaty.php">signed the reform treaty</a> [JURIST report] in December, and 14 countries had <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lisbon+treaty">ratified the document</a> [JURIST news archive] before the Irish rejection. In 2005, an earlier draft <a href="/currentawareness/euconstitution.php">European constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] also failed when voters in <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-exit-polls-say-france.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST reports] rejected the proposal in national referenda.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chicago&#39;s voluntary gun buy-back program brought in more than 6,800 weapons on Saturday as the city sought to address gun violence following the US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/disvhel">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>].  Chicago&#39;s gun control laws are similar to the Washington, DC statutes struck down by the Supreme Court, and the city is currently facing a <a href="http://207.41.16.133/rfcViewFile/08cv3645comp.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawsuits-seek-to-overturn-gun-bans.php">report</a>] brought by four Chicago residents, the <a href="http://www.saf.org/">Second Amendment Foundation</a> (SAF) [advocacy website], and the <a href="http://www.isra.org/">Illinois State Rifle Association</a> (ISRA) [official website], who are challenging handgun bans and registration requirements. The city <a href="http://www.chitowndailynews.org/Chicago_news/Chicago_lays_out_handgun_legal_strategy,15284">plans to defend the lawsuit</a> [<em>Chi-town</em> report] by arguing that <u>Heller</u> only applies to the District of Columbia.  As part of the initiative, headed by mayor Richard Daley, the city <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org:80/city/webportal/portalContentItemAction.do?BV_SessionID=@@@@0392847732.1217192110@@@@&BV_EngineID=cccfadeekehmmifcefecelldffhdfho.0&contentOID=537001155&contenTypeName=COC_EDITORIAL&topChannelName=Dept&blockName=Mayors+Office%2FI+Want+To&context=dept&channelId=0&programId=0&entityName=Mayors+Office&deptMainCategoryOID=">offered $100 for each gun turned in</a> [press release] and amnesty for weapons banned by current laws. Organizers had hoped to collect more than 14,000 guns based on the growth of the program in previous years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Thousands of protesters gathered in cities throughout Bosnia and Serbia on Sunday to demonstrate their continued opposition to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb leader and fugitive <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>].  Serbian nationalists showed their support for Karadzic by wearing <a href="http://it.notizie.yahoo.com/foto/galleria/foto-guerra.html?imageUrl=/ap/20080727/r_p_ap_wl_other/pwl-serbia-karadzic-9c5ee1a-80cbb5cfec100">T-shirts displaying his image</a> [AP photo] and the phrase &quot;Serbian Hero&quot;.  Protesters also carried flags and congregated in churches to light candles and pray for the former leader.  The large-scale demonstrations began on Tuesday when about 200 members of the extremist political group <a href="http://www.obraz.org.yu/">Obraz</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080722/ap_on_re_eu/serbia_karadzic">clashed with riot police</a> [AP report] in the capital city of Belgrade.  Protests on Saturday were organized by Karadzic&#39;s own Serbian Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDS).  Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL633267720080726?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">more</a>.  The Independent Online has <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=24&art_id=nw20080726132742575C270423">additional coverage</a>.  <br /><br />Karadzic was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">originally indicted</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official site] in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity until his arrest last Monday. Karadzic is accused of being involved in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. His capture has been a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1275e.htm">major goal of the ICTY</a> [press release], and follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">June arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb police commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/stojan_zupljanin_176.html">Stojan Zupljanin</a> [Trial Watch profile]. Former ICTY Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile] frequently criticized Serbia for its seeming reluctance to cooperate with the ICTY, exemplified by its failure to <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/serbia-must-do-more-to-arrest-war.php">find and capture</a> [JURIST report] remaining war crimes suspects such as Karadzic.  Karadzic&#39;s arrest is seen by some as the result of the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/07/08/europe/serbia.php">newly appointed</a> [IHT report] pro-western government in Serbia, which came about through an alliance between <a href="http://www.boristadic.org/">Serbian President Boris Tadic</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3806659.stm">profile</a>] and the <a href="http://www.sps.org.yu/cms/index.php">Socialist Party of Serbia</a> (SPS) [official website].

The bill <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-house-approves-foreclosure-bill-with.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] earlier this week with the support of President Bush, who said he <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/business/24housing.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin">will sign the bill</a> [NYT report], rescinding an earlier veto threat because of the included grants. Some have speculated that the legislation will increase the national debt by $800 billion, but a <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO) [official website] <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=9597&type=1">estimate</a> [PDF text] places the cost of the program at about $25 million over the next ten years.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/n21411927-fannie-freddie/">more</a>.   <br /><br />Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/meetings/2008/20080714/draftfedreg.pdf">approved new rules for home mortgage loans</a> [draft regulations, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-reserve-board-approves.php">report</a>] designed to reduce unfair lending practices and increase consumer protection.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Witnesses before the US House Judiciary Committee on Friday <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=280000-1">presented sharply divided opinions</a> [C-span video, flash; hearing <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_072508.html">materials</a>] on whether the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] has overstepped its constitutional authority during George Bush&#39;s presidency, and whether or not such alleged abuses would justify his impeachment.  Committee chairman <a href="http://www.house.gov/conyers/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) opened the hearings outlining the allegedly excessive actions by the administration:<blockquote>It is no secret that I have grave and serious concerns about excesses in executive branch authority.   At my direction this Committee has spent a considerable portion of its time, energy and resources investigating allegations concerning the politicization of the Department of Justice; misuse of signing statements; misuse of authority with regard to detention, interrogation and rendition; possible manipulation of intelligence regarding the Iraq War; improper retaliation against critics of the Administration, including the outing of Valerie Plame; and excessive secrecy by the Administration including the misuse of various privileges and immunities.  I believe the evidence on these matters is both credible and substantial and warrant the response of the executive branch, under oath if at all possible.</blockquote> At the center of the discussions were articles of impeachment against both <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.res.01345:">President George Bush</a> [HR 1345 materials] and <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=3750">Vice President Dick Cheney</a> [HR 333 materials] introduced by Representative&nbsp;<a href="http://kucinich.house.gov/">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) [official website]. Republican members of the committee dismissed the articles, saying the President had not committed impeachable offenses, and that Democrats had introduced them merely as a political tactic. Kucinich&#39;s articles focused on allegedly misleading justifications used by the administration to justify the US&#39;s 2003 invasion of Iraq, but Northwestern University legal history professor <a href="http://www.history.northwestern.edu/faculty/presser.htm">Stephen Presser</a> [faculty profile] <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Presser080725.pdf">said</a> [prepared statement, PDF] there was no evidence that the President had committed an impeachable offense in this or any of the other alleged abuses:<blockquote>Impeachment is a radical remedy to be used only in the case of executive misconduct that demonstrates that the official in question has abused his office for venal purposes. It is not a remedy that the framers believed was appropriate for matter arising simply out of political differences, and impeachment should not be a tool to be used to remove a President simply because a party or faction wants him out of office. Absent misconduct of a kind... which does not seem to be present, the removal of an executive should be accomplished by the constitution[&#39;]s two-term limit, and by the actions of the people and the electoral college.</blockquote><a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> [advocacy website] counsel Frederick Schwarz Jr. <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Schwarz080725.pdf">testified</a> [prepared statement, PDF] that because there was a general lack of information on ways the Bush administration had or had not expanded or overstepped executive powers, an independent commission with a focus on the balance of powers rather than personal indictments should be convened:<blockquote>We must resolve to confront our mistakes so that we do not repeat them.  Throughout American history, in times of crisis, presidents have accumulated significant new powers, and the Executive Branch has often engaged in abusive conduct.  These bursts of misconduct are often closely related to emergency circumstances.  Crisis makes it tempting to ignore the wise restraints that both keep us free and reduce the likelihood of foolish mistakes.  This nation has at times admirably set about correcting its course&#8212; realizing, as the dust settles, or as previously secret facts are revealed, that constitutional and legal norms have been breached.  Our self-correcting mechanism is one of the great strengths of our democracy.  It is time for such a searching assessment and self-correction again.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iE21FOVAfMfEbAE5LDwiYm8fGh4QD9252IFO0">more</a>.<br /><br />The continued hearings on President Bush&#39;s alleged&nbsp;misuse&nbsp;of executive powers follow a number of allegations of wrongdoing. Earlier this month, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-invokes-executive-privilege-in-cia.php">invoked executive privilege</a> [JURIST report] to prevent members of the <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> [official website] from obtaining an FBI report on an interview with Vice President Dick Cheney concerning the <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal</a> [JURIST news archive]. In June, the Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0806/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">report</a>] admitting that it had improperly granted preferential treatment to politically-conservative internship candidates in 2002 and 2006.  Last year former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/gonzales-resigns-as-us-attorney-general.php">resigned</a>  [JURIST report] following allegations concerning the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">alleged firing of US Attorneys for political reasons</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/07/072437P.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF opinion] Friday that criminal courts have no authority to direct <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/training/llw601.PDF">restitution payments</a> [backgrounder] to anyone other than a victim.  The issue came before the court in a case where the defendant was ordered to make scheduled restitution payments to a victim and had a lien placed against her house in accordance with the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/az/victimw/restitut.pdf">Mandatory Restitution Act of 1996</a> [PDF text]. A lower court found it was improper for the defendant and victim to agree to lower the amount due, and ordered some of the money already paid to be returned to equity in the house.  Reversing that order, the Eighth Circuit held that the lower court lacked the authority to distribute fees already collected to anyone other than the victim.  The court indicated that the defendant may have a cause of action against the victim for the invalid agreement.<br /><br />The US Supreme Court ruled on another example of <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/supreme-court-rules-in-blame-shifting.php">overreaching when managing repayment plans</a> in 2006. In <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2005/arkvahl.html">Arkansas Department of Human Services v. Ahlborn</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder] the Court held that federal laws governing <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/home/medicaid.asp">Medicaid</a> [HHS materials] do not authorize a state agency to assert a lien on a Medicaid recipient&#39;s personal injury settlement in an amount equal to the amount of benefits paid on the recipient&#39;s behalf when a lesser amount has been designated as compensation for medical care. Last week it was announced that Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. <a href="http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1784056/">will pay the state of Iowa</a> [McClatchy report] nearly a million dollars in restitution for Medicare payments as part of a settlement stemming from allegations of fraud.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/rwanda0708/rwanda0708web.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] released Friday by <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] states that the <a href="www.gov.rw/">Rwandan government</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda">news archive</a>] has made substantial progress in reforming its justice system over the past four years, but has fallen short in several key areas.  The report commended Rwandan authorities for better ensuring the delivery of justice, strengthening defendants&#8217; rights and abolishing the death penalty, but cautioned that &#8220;the technical and formal improvements in laws and administrative structure have not been matched by gains in independence in the judiciary and assurance of rights to fair trial.&#8221;  Human Rights Watch cited a failure by the government to ensure numerous fair trial standards, including the presumption of innocence, the right to present witnesses in one&#8217;s own defense, and right to protection from double jeopardy.  The report also questioned the independence of the judiciary:<br /><blockquote>Judicial authorities operate in a political context where the executive continues to dominate the judiciary and where there is an official antipathy to views diverging from those of the government and the dominant party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. A campaign against &#8220;divisionism&#8221; and &#8220;genocidal ideology&#8221; imposes the risk of serious consequences on persons who question official interpretations of the past and who would prefer other than the official vision for the future. </blockquote> The report comes at a pivotal stage for the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ictr">news archive</a>], which under <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 1503</a> [PDF text] is expected to complete all trials by 2008 and appeals by 2010.  The Appeals Chamber is currently reviewing several <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/rwanda-justice-officials-criticize-ictr.php">decisions</a> [JURIST report] in which the Trial Chamber refused to transfer cases from the ICTR to Rwandan national courts.  Last month, the Trial Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/dnpnp-ictr-refuses-suspected-war.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] the third bid by ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow and the Rwandan government to transfer a case back to the country&#39;s national justice system, citing a lack of procedural safeguards, including a defendant&#39;s right to present witnesses on his behalf.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nepalese officials said Friday that they had arrested more than 100 Tibetans for allegedly trying to take over the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu. Chinese media said the protesters were trying to use Nepal&#39;s vulnerability as a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-constituent-assembly-abolishes.php">newly-formed republic</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in order to <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/25/content_8769797.htm">push their &quot;separatist&quot; agenda</a> [Xinhua report], but Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/tibetnepal0708/">report</a> [HRW materials; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/23/nepal19446.htm">press release</a>] Thursday saying that Nepal has been arresting peaceful Tibetan protesters without cause because of pressure from the Chinese: <blockquote>At least 8,350 arrests of Tibetans were made between March 10 and July 18 (many people were arrested more than once). While the frequency of protests has diminished since May, protests have continued to take place on an almost weekly basis, with continuing abuses by Nepali authorities in response. Few of those arrested have been provided with a reason for their detention and virtually all have been released without charge.<br /><br />Human Rights Watch has directly observed many of the Tibetan demonstrations in Kathmandu and the police response to them. From March 10 to 28, Nepali police consistently responded to the demonstrations with unnecessary or excessive force, using lathis to beat protesters in the head and body, and by kicking and punching them. Police officers have sexually assaulted Tibetan women during arrest. Many women and girls have reported male police officers groping them and kicking or hitting them with a lathi in the groin.</blockquote> Reuters has <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2008-07-25T121452Z_01_DEL325586_RTRUKOC_0_US-NEPAL-TIBET-PROTESTS.xml">more</a>.<br /><br />In April Nepalese police <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/nepal-police-arrest-500-more-protesters.php">detained more than 500</a> [JURIST report] Tibetan monks, refugees, and other protesters near the <a href="http://np.china-embassy.org/eng/">Chinese Embassy</a> [embassy website, in English] in Kathmandu as demonstrations continued against China&#39;s repression of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7299221.stm">pro-Tibet protests</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In March the country <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/nepal-police-arrest-100-more-protesters.php">conducted a sweep</a> [JURIST report] in which hundreds were taken into Nepalese police custody. Since the demonstrations began, the <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/index.html">local office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/resources/Documents/English/pressreleases/MAR2008/2008_03-17_Tibetan%20protests_E.pdf">criticized Nepal</a> [press release, PDF] for its actions against protesters and for restricting the right to peaceful assembly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">United Nations Security Council</a> [official website] on Friday discussed a <a href="http://www.kosovocompromise.com/cms/item/analysis/en.html?view=story&id=1127&sectionId=2">report</a> [link to PDF file] outlining UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/eu-to-oversee-kosovo-rule-of-law.php">plans</a> [JURIST report] to reconfigure the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) [official website] now that the state&#39;s new constitution has entered into effect.  Lamberto Zannier, whom Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sga1139.doc.htm">recently appointed</a> [press release] as head of UNMIK and Special Representative to Kosovo, has already <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/DPI/Transcripts.nsf/0/099CA1E2EB33D45EC1257474002A15CE/$FILE/PC-250608-SRSG_Lzannier.pdf">stated</a> [press briefing, PDF] that he envisions a &quot;radical&quot; restructuring of the Mission. Speaking before the Security Council on Friday, Zannier stated that he can <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9407.doc.htm">no longer enforce his authority</a> [UN summary], meaning that he cannot promulgate laws or exert control over the rule of law efforts. The Security Council could not reach a consensus on the future of UNMIK and was unable to provide an advisory statement to Ban. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlMi7cgONjOeTI1kGAXeYcLMsH2w">more</a>.<br />  <br />The new <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?id=1">European Union Rule of Law Mission</a> (EULEX) [official website] is expected to take over the rule of law area in Kosovo as UNMIK nears the end of its 120-day timetable for reducing operations and handing over responsibilities.  After that time, EULEX will continue to function in an advisory role with some executive authority. Powers formerly reserved for the Special Representative have been re-allocated under the new constitution.  The <a href="http://www.ico-kos.org/en/">International Civilian Office</a> [official website] will oversee progress under Kosovo&#39;s status settlement. Kosovo&#39;s new <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in June.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfoptiveruscomplaint072408.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/newsroom/enforcementpressreleases/2008/pr5521-08.html">press release and materials</a>] Thursday against international trading fund <a href="http://www.optiver.com/">Optiver Holding BV</a> [corporate website] and some of its subsidiaries and employees, alleging that the company manipulated the futures prices of oil and gasoline in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/7/usc_sup_01_7_10_1.html">Commodity Exchange Act</a> [7 USC s. 1 text]. The suit, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that for 11 days in March 2007, Optiver and some of its officials bought large numbers of futures contracts in certain oil and gasoline markets on the <a href="http://www.nymex.com/index.aspx">New York Mercantile Exchange</a> (NYMEX) [official website], with the so-called TAS purchases requiring an initial agreement to pay either more or less than the closing bell price. Optiver and its agents would then trade the futures immediately before closing in the opposite direction they had agreed to earlier that day, and by doing so allegedly earned about $1 million. The complaint notes: <blockquote>Optiver&#39;s strategy was to execute approximately 20-30 [percent] of its futures contract trades just before the Close and the remainder during the Close. Having accumulated a large net TAS position during the trading day, Defendants intended to - and on several occasions did - implement this strategy to trade a large number of futures contracts in the opposite direction just prior to and during the Close, thereby exercising their market power to improperly influence and affect the price of futures contracts in a desired direction.</blockquote> CFTC has requested an injunction preventing the company and its associates from violating related US law, and wants the court to prohibit them from trading or otherwise working with commodity interests. The agency seeks monetary penalties of either $130,000 from each defendant or triple the amount gained by the scheme, whichever is greater. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/business/25cftc.html?em&ex=1217131200&en=1de082ec7886ea22&ei=5087%0A">more</a>.<br /><br />On Friday, the US Senate rejected a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s3268pcs.txt.pdf">bill</a> [S. 3268 text, PDF; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.03268:">materials</a>] designed to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to prevent unchecked energy speculation. The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider its own <a href="http://agriculture.house.gov/inside/Legislation/110/CMTAA.pdf">proposed legislation</a> [text, PDF] to amend the Act next week. If passed, it would increase transparency in and oversight of the energy markets. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSWAT00984520080725?sp=true">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36104res20080724.html">memos</a> [materials] released Thursday indicate that certain enhanced interrogation techniques, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboard">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], are lawful and that those who employ them in good faith lack the specific intent required to be charged with torture. Under US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340----000-.html">law</a> [18 USC s. 2340 text], torture involves &quot;an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control.&quot; In a heavily-redacted 2002 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/cia_3686_001.pdf">memo</a> [text, PDF], then-Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee wrote: <blockquote>To violate the statute, an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering. Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture. As we previously opined, to have the required specific intent, an individual must expressly intend to cause such severe pain or suffering. We have further found that is a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering, he has not acted with specific intent. A defendant acts in good faith when he has an honest belief that his actions will not result in severe pain or suffering. Although an honest belief need not be reasonable, such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it. Good faith may be established by, among other things, the reliance in the advice of experts. [Citations omitted]</blockquote> Bybee is now a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] judge.  The 2003 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/cia_3684_001.pdf">memo</a> [text, PDF] indicates that enhanced interrogation techniques are acceptable, though the text is largely blacked-out and lacks definitions, while the 2004 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/cia_3685_001.pdf">memo</a> [text, PDF] says that techniques including waterboarding do not violate the torture statute. AP has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/guantanamo/story/616531.html">more</a>.<br /><br />US interrogation methods are now under international scrutiny. The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/533/533.pdf">Human Rights Annual Report 2007</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-commons-report-casts-doubt-on-us.php">report</a>] released Sunday by the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/foreign_affairs_committee.cfm">House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [committee website] recommended that the UK not rely on any assurances made by the US that it does not use torture.  The report also calls on the UK to fully investigate US interrogation tactics to ensure that no torture techniques are being used on US detainees. The report&#39;s section on torture focuses on <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=water+boarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] and the disconnect between US statements that the practice does not constitute torture and testimony by UK <a href="http://www.davidmiliband.info/">Foreign Secretary David Miliband</a> [official website] that &quot;water-boarding [sic] amounts to torture.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-51489-CR0.wpd.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] seven out of 12 charges against two US border agents who were found guilty of unlawfully shooting an illegal immigrant smuggling drugs and then trying to cover up the incident. In 2006 <a href="http://ignacioramos.com/">Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean</a> [advocacy website] were convicted on charges of assault, discharge of a weapon in the commission of a crime of violence, tampering with an official proceeding, and deprivation of civil rights. The trial court sentenced them to 11 and 12 years in prison respectively after it was found that they failed to report their shooting of Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, a drug trafficker who had entered the United States illegally and was shot once while fleeing back across the US-Mexico border after border agents disrupted his marijuana delivery. In rejecting the defendants <a href="http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/constitution/amendment06/">Sixth Amendment</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5afrag1_user.html#amdt5a_hd4">Fifth Amendment</a> [texts] arguments, among others, the court concluded Monday: <blockquote>For the most part, the trial of this case was about credibility, and although the jury could have gone either way, it chose not to believe the defendants&#8217; version of the crucial events of February 17. The trial of the case was conducted fairly and without reversible error. The exclusion of evidence relating to the size of the marijuana load and Aldrete-Davila&#8217;s alleged involvement in drug-trafficking events of October 2005 did not violate the defendants&#8217; Sixth Amendment rights to present a complete defense nor did it deny them a proper cross-examination of a witness against them. They were denied no right of due process for lack of notice that &sect; 924(c) could be applied to police officers while performing law enforcement duties. Nor was the &sect; 924(c) indictment defective. Moreover, the defendants were properly convicted of substantive crimes, not for violating Border Patrol policies. In instructing the jury, no reversible errors were committed and, finally, the evidence fully supports the jury verdict. We therefore affirm the convictions for counts 1 through 5 and counts 11 and 12.</blockquote>The majority of the border agents&#39; upheld sentences were the result of their conviction for <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.html">discharging a weapon in the commission of a crime of violence</a> [18 USC s. 924 text], which carries a minimum sentence of ten years. The court did overturn their convictions for <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1512.html">tampering with an official proceeding</a> [18 USC s. 1512 text] because it determined the Border Patrol investigation was not an &quot;official proceeding&quot; within the meaning of the statute. The case was remanded for resentencing. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXihPpn22rM9HFMgrc8yMDXAbyWQD9274IRG2">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">El Paso Times</span> has <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_10027171?source=most_viewed">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In a <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/ca52_hunter/Agents_Fifth_circut.shtml">statement</a> [press release] Monday, US Rep. <a href="http://www.house.gov/hunter/index.shtml">Duncan Hunter</a> (R-CA) [official website] joined US Sens. <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/">John Cornyn</a> (R-TX) [official website; <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=ForPress.NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=6b45fec0-802a-23ad-40cc-1eec1cf356af">press release</a>] and <a href="http://feinstein.senate.gov/public/">Diane Feinstein</a> (D-CA) [official website] in calling on President George W. Bush to pardon Ramos and Compean. There have also been calls for a review of Aldrete-Davila&#39;s prosecution by Texas <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txw/us_attorney/index.html">US Attorney Johnny Sutton</a> [official website] after he was <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=44597">arrested</a> [WorldNetDaily report] in 2007 for drug smuggling. Aldrete-Davila had been given immunity to testify against Ramos and Compean during their trial in 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court of Turkey</a> [official website, in Turkish] Wednesday rejected a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/dnp-turkey.php">bid to ban</a> [JURIST report] the country&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Islamic Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], which was accused of ignoring the secular principles of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/tu00000_.html">constitution</a> [text]. Six of the 11 judges on the court favored dissolving the party, but seven would have been required to successfully pass the ban. The court agreed that the party violated the constitution&#39;s secular principles, but only ordered that the state treasury reduce the party&#39;s funding by half in response.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] Wednesday <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20080730_1bvr326207.html">ruled</a> [text, in German; <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg08-078.html#top">press release</a>, in German] that state laws banning smoking in bars are unconstitutional as they now stand. Smoking in public places is regulated on a state-by-state basis in Germany, and most states allow bars to designate a separate room for smokers. The court found that such laws unconstitutionally discriminate against one-room bars, and that smoking must either be banned in bars entirely or the law rewritten to create exemptions for smaller businesses. AP has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-germany-smoking-ban,1,2155060.story">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, the federal government of Germany <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/germany-scraps-nationwide-smoking-ban.php">rejected a proposed nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants</a> [JURIST report] out of concern that it would intrude on police powers guaranteed to the states in the wake of <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/germany-considers-largest.php">federalism reforms</a> [JURIST report] <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/germany-parliament-passes-major.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] that summer. Under the new constitutional reforms, Germany&#39;s 16 states have the power to regulate restaurants and businesses. Elsewhere in Europe, legislatures of <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/uk-cabinet-approves-english-smoking.php">England</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/france-to-impose-smoking-ban-in-all.php">France</a> [JURIST reports] have approved nationwide smoking bans in public places. In the US, voters in three states approved <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/smoking-bans-approved-in-three-states.php">state-wide smoking bans</a> [JURIST report] in the 2006 November elections, while Rhode Island amended its smoking ban after a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/rhode-island-may-amend-smoking-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of the law as irrational and therefore unconstitutional in 2005.

Seven men convicted were given sentences ranging from 38 to 42 years; four others on trial were acquitted of all charges. The court held that the suspects knew the killings they were accomplices to were designed to eliminate Bosnian Muslims from the camp, and also convicted two of the men for killings committed by subordinates. In a press release, the court recounted the incident central to the <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/files/docs/optuznice/KRAVICE_INDICTMENT.pdf">2005 indictment</a> [text, PDF; 2008 <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/files/docs/optuznice/2008/Milos_Stupar_and_Others_-_AMMENDED_INDICTMENT.pdf">amendment</a>, PDF] of the men: <blockquote>The Panel found that several thousand Bosniak men were captured and detained at the Sandi?i meadow in the morning and afternoon of 13 July. These men were part of the column of Bosniak men attempting to break out from the Srebrenica enclave after the capture of the enclave by the forces of the Republika Srpska. Many of these men were induced to surrender by deception, and were told they would be safe and taken to territory under control of ARBiH. At least one thousand of these men were then transported by bus or marched in a column to the warehouse of the Farming Cooperative Kravica, where they were further detained. Beginning in the early evening, shortly after the arrival of the column of men, these prisoners were executed in the warehouse by small arms fire, machine gun fire and the use of hand grenades.</blockquote>BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/click/rss/1.0/-/2/hi/europe/7531413.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>], the man accused of running the camp, was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1277e.htm">transferred</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-transferred-to-hague-tribunal.php">report</a>] from Serbia to the custody of the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] to face trial on related war crimes charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU) [advocacy website] has announced that health insurance company <a href="http://www.bcbswny.com/bcbs_dspy.php?catg=home">BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York</a> [corporate website] has agreed to <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/node/1904">extend health-care benefits</a> [NYCLU press release] to spouses in validly married same-sex couples. In February, judges for a New York state appeals court unanimously <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ad4/Court/Decisions/2008/02-01-08/PDF/1562.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-york-court-rules-that-state-must.php">report</a>] that the state must legally recognize valid out-of-state same-sex marriages. Following that ruling, the NYCLU <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/node/1899">filed a lawsuit</a> [NYCLU backgrounder] in early July after the insurance company refused to provide coverage for a woman&#39;s same-sex spouse, even though the women had legally married in Canada in 2006. In response to the company&#39;s recent decision, NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman said Monday: <blockquote>We applaud Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Western New York for following the law and treating all married couples the same. Families who were denied coverage up until this point will now be able to protect themselves with health care coverage.</blockquote> NYCLU lawyers have said that they are still seeking monetary damages for the couple&#39;s prior out-of-pocket expenses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] have filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/kennedy_07-343amicusrehearing1.pdf">motion</a> [PDF text] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] requesting permission to petition for rehearing in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-343.ZO.html">Kennedy v. Louisiana</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">report</a>], in which the Court found that a death sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment when imposed for a crime of child rape in which the victim was not killed. The majority in the case supported its reasoning by saying that very few states had such laws and that - incorrectly - there were no federal laws allowing the punishment for rape. Shortly afterwards, the DOJ said that it had <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-admits-overlooking-military-law-in.php">mistakenly failed to brief the Court</a> [JURIST report] on the existence of a <a href="http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/PL109-163.pdf">military law</a> [PDF text] allowing capital punishment for child rape. The motion, filed Monday, notes: <blockquote>While the United States believes that the Court&#8217;s decision is incorrect and that the State&#8217;s law should be upheld under a proper analysis, even if the Court reaches the same result following rehearing, rehearing is warranted to ensure that a material omission in the decisionmaking process has not tainted the Court&#8217;s decision on a matter of such profound constitutional, moral, and practical importance. Accordingly, the United States urges the Court to grant rehearing.</blockquote> The DOJ motion is highly unusual as groups not party to the original case are usually barred from seeking rehearing. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080729/pl_afp/usjusticerape_080729214535">more</a>. SCOTUSblog has <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/us-urges-new-hearing-on-death-penalty/">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Patrick Kennedy was sentenced to death in Louisiana for raping a minor, one of the few remaining crimes where the death of a victim is not required for the death penalty. The Court found that in cases where the victim was not killed, the death penalty fails to serve &quot;deterrent or retributive&quot; purposes invoked for its use. Last week, Louisiana state prosecutors <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/rehear-kennedy-v-la-7-21-08.pdf">petitioned</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/military-law-could-change-supreme-court.php">report</a>] the Court to reconsider the case, arguing that a 2006 amendment to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/stApIIch47.html">Uniform Code of Military Conduct</a> [LII materials] does in fact allow the death penalty at court-martial for rape and child rape. The Court rarely agrees to such petitions, but Louisiana lawyers said a review was warranted because of that oversight. The oversight was first <a href="http://caaflog.blogspot.com/2008/06/supremes-dis-military-justice-system.html">raised</a> [CAAFlog post] by a civilian Air Force lawyer in his blog on military justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK House of Lords judges Wednesday <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-1.htm">denied the appeal</a> [judgment text] of a man accused of hacking US government computers in 2001 and 2002 who had <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/JudicialEasterSitting.pdf">argued</a> [certified points of appeal, PDF] that his extradition to the US would violate his human rights. British police arrested systems analyst <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4715612.stm">Gary McKinnon</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://freegary.org.uk/">advocacy website</a>] in 2002, and US authorities <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usmck1102vaind.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] him later that year on charges of hacking NASA, Department of Defense, Air Force, Army and Navy computers in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">US computer laws</a> [18 USC 1030 text]. The British government granted the 2005 US extradition request, but McKinnon&#39;s lawyer appealed, alleging that US authorities had told McKinnon that if he did not plead guilty to the charges, he could be sentenced to life in prison since each of the seven counts against him is punishable by up to <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/mckinnonIndict.htm">10 years of imprisonment and a $250,000 fine</a> [indictment press release]. The Law Lords unanimously dismissed the appeal. Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood wrote:<blockquote>[I]t would only be in a wholly extreme case . . . that the court should properly regard any encouragement to accused persons to surrender for trial and plead guilty, in particular if made by a prosecutor during a regulated process of plea bargaining, as so unconscionable as to constitute an abuse of process justifying the requested state&#8217;s refusal to extradite the accused. It is difficult, indeed, to think of anything other than the threat of unlawful action which could fairly be said so to imperil the integrity of the extradition process as to require the accused, notwithstanding his having resisted the undue pressure, to be discharged irrespective of the strength of the case against him.</blockquote> McKinnon&#39;s lawyers have said they will file an appeal against the judgment to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website]. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&sid=aVR7OdqQyNEI&refer=uk">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span> has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4428270.ece">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />McKinnon has not denied the charges against him but has said that he was motivated by a desire to uncover &quot;hidden technology&quot; capable of benefiting all of mankind and evidence of UFOs, which he claims is being suppressed by the US military.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Council of Europe (COE) <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile] Tuesday urged Italy to change immigration and preemptive crime policies that he says marginalize the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma and Sinti minorities</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hammarberg <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CommDH%282008%2918">memorandum</a> [text; <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR558%282008%29&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">press release</a>] was issued following visit to the country during which he reported harsh conditions in Roma camps and heard accounts of harsh treatment of the groups by police. He said that in addition to the harm caused by the policies themselves, openly anti-Roma governmental statements reinforced popular xenophobic sentiment against the group and immigrants in general:<blockquote>The hostile environment to non-dominant, vulnerable social groups has recently been fostered by statements of certain national and local political figures as well as by a number of mass media in the country. In meetings with the Commissioner representatives of important NGOs deplored an almost total lack of rejection of xenophobic statements by senior politicians. Representatives of Roma and Sinti felt that such lack of reaction, combined with the &#8220;security package&#8221;, had further encouraged violence and hate speech against their communities. They expressed a fairly dramatic need for protection.<br /><br />The Commissioner is seriously concerned about the adoption or preparation by the government of severe legislation which is aimed at ensuring &#8220;public security&#8221; and imposing a firmer control over immigration, including of EU citizens, and over the presence and movement of Roma and Sinti populations. ... While stronger action against individual criminal offenders may be required, including enhanced international judicial cooperation, the swift adoption of broad packages of the sort currently implemented or considered in Italy entails a clear risk of linking insecurity to specific groups of population and of generating confusion between offenders and foreigners. Such risk should be carefully avoided, if one is not to further feed xenophobic tendencies.</blockquote>Hammarberg recognized government actions that had been taken to protect the rights of the groups, but said that they were ineffective solutions to a problem that required sweeping reforms, such as those the COE recommended in resolutions adopted in <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=ResCMN%282006%295&Language=lanEnglish&Site=COE&BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&BackColorIntranet=FDC864&BackColorLogged=FDC864">2006</a> and <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CM/Rec%282008%295&Language=lanEnglish&Site=COE&BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&BackColorIntranet=FDC864&BackColorLogged=FDC864">2008</a> [texts]. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/29/europe/EU-Europe-Italy-Immigration.php">more</a>.<br /><br />Hammarberg has criticized recent security measures taken by various European governments, saying they infringe on rights the countries have agreed to uphold. Last week, Hammarberg called on COE states to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/council-of-europe-report-urges-nations.php">critically examine human rights</a> [JURIST report] in their own countries. In a June BBC interview, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/eu-rights-commissioner-warns-uk-42-day.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the proposed UK anti-terror legislation allowing law enforcement authorities to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=42+days+UK">detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days</a> [JURIST report] should not be passed as it could set a bad precedent for detention laws in other countries.

Karadzic, who has been <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">indicted</a> [text] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia last week after evading capture for nearly 13 years. On Monday one of his lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-karadzic-appeals.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] with a Serb court to block his extradition and transfer, but said he had intentionally delayed the filing in order to postpone a decision until after Tuesday&#39;s <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=07&dd=29&nav_id=52281">pro-Karadzic rally</a> [B92 report] in Belgrade. Court officials said, however, that they had not received any appeal.<br /><br />ICTY prosecutor Serge Brammertz <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1278e.htm">said</a> [statement] Wednesday that Karadzic&#39;s arrest and transfer was &quot;important for international justice because it clearly demonstrates that there is no alternative to the arrest of war criminals and that there can be no safe haven for fugitives&quot;. He additionally hailed the efforts of Serb officials in finally bringing Karadzic to justice:<BLOCKQUOTE>Serbian authorities deserve full credit for the apprehension of Radovan Karad&#382;i?. This arrest is a major achievement in Serbia&#8217;s cooperation with the Tribunal. I make special mention of the National Security Council, Serbia&#8217;s Action Team in charge of tracking fugitives and the Office of the War Crimes Prosecutor in Belgrade. I look forward to meeting the authorities in Belgrade in the coming weeks and hope that Serbia&#8217;s cooperation will lead to the arrest of the two remaining fugitives, Ratko Mladi? and Goran Had&#382;i?. Without these arrests we cannot complete our mandate</BLOCKQUOTE>Karadzic is scheduled to make his <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pa345e.html">initial appearance</a> [ICTY press release] before the ICTY on Thursday afternoon.

He is accused of involvement in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other war crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A DC federal grand jury Tuesday <a href="http://blogs.trb.com/news/politics/blog/2008/07/29/Stevens_indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-crm-668.html">press release</a>] US <a href="http://stevens.senate.gov/public/">Sen. Ted Stevens</a> (R-AK) [official website] on seven counts of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1001.html">making false statements</a> [18 USC s. 1001(a) text] relating to an alleged corruption scheme and for falsifying his Financial Disclosure Forms. Stevens allegedly accepted about $250,000 in gifts over an eight-year period from the founder of oil services and engineering company <a href="http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/energy/veco.asp">VECO Corp.</a> [corporate website] and in exchange reportedly used his influence in Washington to improperly benefit the company and its employees. The indictment asserts that: <blockquote>Stevens, while a sitting United States Senator, knowingly and willfully engaged in a scheme to conceal a material fact, that is, his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars&#39; worth of things of value from a private corporation and its chief executive officer by, among other things, failing to report them, as was required, on Stevens&#39; required yearly Financial Disclosure Forms.</blockquote> According to the indictment, the gifts included home improvements, vehicle trades and other smaller gifts. VECO founder Bill Allen and another VECO executive, Richard Smith, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/May/07_crm_333.html">pleaded guilty</a> [press release] in May 2007 &quot;to providing more than $400,000 in corrupt payments to public officials from the state of Alaska.&quot; CBS and AP have <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/29/politics/main4303372.shtml">more</a>. The <em>Anchorage Daily News</em> has <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/stevens/story/478349.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/fbi-searches-home-of-alaska-senator-in.php">searched Stevens&#39; home</a> [JURIST report] as part of a continuing investigation into corruption in Alaska. The Department of Justice (DOJ) reports that so far seven politicians and lobbyists have been convicted in connection with the investigation, including <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-alaska-lawmaker-convicted-of.php">former Alaska state Representative Tom Anderson</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2007, Anderson was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/former-alaska-lawmaker-sentenced-to-5.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to five years in prison for accepting nearly $26,000 he believed to be from private correctional facilities firm <a href="http://www.cornellcompanies.com/">Cornell Industries</a> [corporate website] in exchange for Anderson&#39;s influence on then-pending measures on halfway houses. The deal had actually been arranged by an FBI informant inside Cornell who recorded incriminating conversations with Anderson and former lobbyist Bill Bobrick. Bobrick pleaded guilty in May 2007 to corruption charges.

According to the report, the initial examining doctor at a private hospital could not find evidence of sexual assault, but advised the aide to undergo a second examination at a government hospital.

Anwar <a href="http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2008/07/29/sidang-akhbar-dsai-jam-1130am/">responded</a> [personal blog post] to the report: <blockquote>I have willingly cooperated in the police investigations; careless and vindictive though it has turned out to be. But I have decided that nation is in a grave situation economically and socially and I can no longer be distracted by such nuisances. I am now determined to move ahead with the reform agenda, which the Malaysian people endorse in the last elections, and I do not intend to address this scurrilous accusations anymore [<em>sic</em>].</blockquote> Anwar said that the government should <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/29/nation/20080729133514&sec=nation">drop the case against him</a> in light of the leaked medical report, but the Health Ministry has responded that it will stand by the prior undisclosed results in another medical report and the government has said it <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/29/nation/20080729152100&sec=nation">will not drop the investigation</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Star</font> reports]. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSKLR210172">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Star</font> has <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/29/nation/21944324&sec=nation">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Malaysian authorities briefly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> Anwar earlier this month, less than a day after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-authorities-issue-arrest.php">warrant was issued for his arrest</a> [JURIST reports]. Anwar has claimed that the sodomy allegations leveled against him are politically motivated, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the expiration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Last month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges at London&#39;s High Court  Monday rejected an appeal against the extradition of three Tunisian men arrested on terrorism charges who argued that their removal to Italy could ultimately lead to their torture. The three were arrested late last year in England after an Italian judge issued an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm">European arrest warrants</a> (EAWs) [EU backgrounder] for them. In May, a UK judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSL1729257020080520">ordered their extradition</a> [Reuters report]. Reiterating their earlier High Court claims before Monday&#39;s appeal ruling, the men argued that under Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.parlamento.it/leggi/05155l.htm">Pisanu Law</a> [text, in Italian], they could be extradited to Tunisia, where they could face torture. The High Court judges acknowledged that Italy&#39;s past use of the Law was &quot;disturbing,&quot; but said that under a 2002 EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002F0584:EN:HTML">Council Framework Decision on EAWs</a> [text], the country must ensure the men&#39;s Article 3 protections against torture of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [PDF text]. The men have all denied the charges, and they have 14 days to appeal the decision to the House of Lords. The Press Association has <a href="http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gt0_DcDSK8bpluHEPPT1ES_xewwA">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jiTDz2zivopJdgsd9TkXMZwjHueQ">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE30/007/2008/en/b8527bf4-3ebc-11dd-9656-05931d46f27f/mde300072008eng.html">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/tunisia-human-rights-lip-service-20080623">press release</a>] accusing Tunisia of committing widespread human rights abuses under broad anti-terrorism legislation. AI also criticized the US, as well as European and other Arab countries, for <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/tunisia-appeals-court-affirms-terror.php">turning over terror suspects to Tunisian authorities</a> [JURIST report] despite allegations of torture and other abuses. In February, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/viewhbkm.asp?sessionId=5831113&skin=hudoc-en&action=html&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649&key=68712&highlight">ruled against the deportation</a> [text] of a former Tunisian terrorism suspect, finding he would likely be <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/europe-rights-court-upholds-absolute.php">subjected to torture</a> [JURIST report] in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights if returned to Tunisia. In September 2007, Human Rights Watch released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2007/tunisia0907/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/09/05/tunisi16792.htm">press release</a>] accusing Tunisian officials of <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/tunisia-abusing-ex-guantanamo-detainees.php">mistreating two former Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] after they were returned to the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The human rights situation in China has continued to deteriorate as the start of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games draws closer, according to a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/089/2008/en/8249b304-5724-11dd-90eb-ff4596860802/asa170892008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/chinese-authorities-broken-promises-threaten-olympic-legacy-20080728">press release</a>] released Tuesday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The report, which updated an April AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/050/2008/en/b5e6bfd8-0176-11dd-8daf-5b71323cd12c/asa170502008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] detailing ongoing human rights abuses in the country, evaluated the Chinese government on its use of the death penalty, administrative detentions, the detention and abuse of rights activists, including journalists and lawyers, and Internet censorship. The report said that in almost all of these areas, Chinese human rights abuses have remained constant or have increased: <blockquote>[O]n balance the Chinese authorities have so far failed to fulfil[l] their own commitments to improve human rights. In fact, the authorities have used the Olympic Games as pretext to continue, and in some respects, intensify existing policies and practices which have led to serious and widespread violations of human rights. Within the core areas monitored by Amnesty International, the only sign of significant reform is with regard to the application of the death penalty and the ability of foreign media to cover news stories in China. While these reforms are welcome, they have both been beset by structural weaknesses and a failure to make them fully operational in practice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush Monday approved the death sentence of US Army private Ronald A. Gray, marking the first time a president has approved a military execution since 1957. Gray was first tried by a civilian court for his connection to four murders and eight rapes in North Carolina in the mid-1980s. There he pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and five counts of rape, and the court sentenced him to life in prison. A court-martial panel then <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ggP77qC4esV3XpNNgJq25XW25f0QD927G0984">convicted</a> [AP report] Gray in 1988 of two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, as well as counts of rape, forcible sodomy, and robbery, in violation of the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text]. He was dishonorably discharged, demoted and sentenced to death, a military sentence that requires presidential approval under the UCMJ. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Services finally <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/1999Term/93-7001.htm">rejected Gray&#39;s appeal</a> [opinion text] in 1999, and the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/2000/0responses/2000-0607.resp.pdf">denied <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span></a> [government Supreme Court brief, PDF] in 2001. Following Bush&#39;s approval of the sentence, White House press secretary Dana Perino commented: <blockquote>While approving a sentence of death for a member of our armed services is a serious and difficult decision for a commander-in-chief, the president believes the facts of this case leave no doubt that the sentence is just and warranted.</blockquote> Gray is expected to appeal the approval. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i_mZdvppBtK3id0QbBB5nBAjU2RA">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/us/29execute.html?ref=us">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 1996, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1966.ZO.html">ruled</a> [<u>Loving v. US</u> opinion text] that courts-martial have the authority to impose the death sentence on members of the military and that the president may prescribe the aggravating factors that lead to such a sentence. There, a court-martial panel found a man guilty of murders in 1988, and he argued that a military death sentence by order of the president violated the separation of powers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could delegate powers to other branches of the government and that in the case of military death sentences, the president&#39;s prescription of the constitutionally required aggravating factors did not violate the separation of powers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Thailand Monday <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080728/D926OA680.html">agreed to hear</a> [AP report] a new corruption case against ousted <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and 47 others, including three current cabinet members. The case involves allegations of misconduct related to the national lottery system, and names Finance Minister Surapong Suebwonglee, Labor Minister Uraiwan Thienthong and Deputy Transport Minister Anurak Jureemas as defendants. The status of the serving ministers under Thai law is in dispute; at a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSBKK7973220080729">meeting</a> [Reuters report] Tuesday, the Cabinet asked the government&#39;s legal experts to look into the issue and make recommendations rather than suspend the ministers outright, as some experts say is required under the constitution. AFP has <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/363340/1/.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed other corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin relating to a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. A company then owned by Thaksin&#39;s family saw the greatest benefit from the new payment scheme, leading to claims that Thaksin misused his authority for personal gain. Thaksin, who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ousted in a military coup</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, is currently the subject of 24 legal actions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Justice Department Offices of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig">Inspector General</a> and <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opr/">Professional Responsibility</a> [official websites] concluded in a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opr/goodling072408.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] issued Monday that department aides illegally made hiring decisions based on consideration of applicants&#39; political and ideological beliefs. In early 2007, officials <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/justice-department-investigating.php">began investigating allegations</a> [JURIST report] that former DOJ aide <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Monica+Goodling">Monica Goodling</a> [JURIST news archive] and two other aides considered the political affiliations of candidates for career prosecutor positions in the Department, contrary to <a href="http://www.osc.gov/documents/pubs/rights.htm">federal law</a> [OSC backgrounder] and internal practices. The report observed: <blockquote>It is not improper to consider political or ideological affiliations in making hiring decisions for political positions. However, both Department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations.<br /><br />Our investigation found that Goodling improperly subjected candidates for certain career positions to the same politically based evaluation she used on candidates for political positions, in violation of federal law and Department policy.</blockquote> The report also concluded that Goodling and one of the other aides committed misconduct through their actions. It recommended that the DOJ consider the aides&#39; actions if any sought DOJ employment, while noting they could not currently be sanctioned because they had all resigned from the Department. Attorney General Michael Mukasey <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-opa-658.html">responded</a> [press release] late Monday that the Department had made institutional improvements since the investigation began and that the Department would implement the Offices&#39; new recommendations. AP has <a href="http://news.lp.findlaw.com/ap/a/w/1152/07-28-2008/20080728082006_51.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Documents - including written notes by Goodling - handed over by the Department of Justice to the House Judiciary Committee in April 2007 indicated that officials in the Department <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/doj-considered-politics-in-evaluating.php">took sitting federal prosecutors&#39; political activities</a> [JURIST report] and connections to the conservative Federalist Society into account in deciding whether to retain them. Goodling also was <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/gonzales-order-authorized-aides-to-fire.php">given broad authority</a> [JURIST report] over the hiring of non-civil service lawyers and officers with the Department, leading Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to express concern that the practice was part of a &quot;systematic scheme to inject political influence into the hiring and firing decisions of key Justice employees.&quot; Goodling resigned the same month over her alleged role in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">firings of US Attorneys</a> [JURIST news archive] for political reasons, but in May 2007 she testified before the House Judiciary Committee that she <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/GoodlingII070523.pdf">did not play a key role in the firings</a> [prepared statement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/goodling-denies-key-role-in-us-attorney.php">report</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers representing <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [Reprieve profile], the last British resident still detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], argued at a Monday High Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-judge-orders-hearing-on-government.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] in London that the UK Foreign Office should be compelled to turn over evidence necessary to his defense before a US military commission. The evidence sought allegedly shows that Mohamed was the victim of torture and <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive]. On Friday, Mohamed&#39;s lawyer <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0728/1217013340456.html">asked the Irish government</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report] to turn over information about <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">CIA rendition flights</a> [JURIST news archive] that allegedly landed in Ireland in 2002 and 2004 while transporting Mohamed.

IRNA has <a href="http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0807285067151401.htm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Mohamed says he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials who later transferred him to Moroccan agents who tortured him; he was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, in a <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">letter</a> [DOC text] sent by his lawyer to UK Foreign Secretary David Milliband, he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">asked the UK government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved. For most of 2007, Binyam was one of five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+residents+guantanamo">UK residents detained at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Three of those were <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11576">released</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-residents-released-from-guantanamo.php">report</a>] from US custody in December. A fourth British resident, Shaker Abdur-Raheem Aamer, a Saudi Arabian national, was to be returned there but his current status is unclear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Thai court on Thursday convicted <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive], the wife of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], of tax evasion for transferring $16.3 million worth of stock to her step-brother and secretary, who were also convicted. Pojamarn and step-brother Bannapot Damapong were each sentenced to three years and her secretary was sentenced to two years imprisonment for the crime. Pojamarn has said the transfer was exempt from taxation as a gift, and all three have been released on bail while they appeal the ruling. Pojamarn also faces a number of corruption charges made by the country&#39;s Assets Examination Commission. In April, she <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/thailand-ex-pm-returning-in-may-to-face.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of conflict of interest and malfeasance stemming from a 2003 agreement with the government-directed <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website] to purchase land said to be worth three times more than the $26 million she paid for it. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gVrvM8XYEq3Ijsiwd-gW11dNuwkw">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129171">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />On Tuesday, the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-high-court-takes-corruption.php">brought its latest charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin, alleging that he and 47 others were involved in misconduct related to the country&#39;s lottery system. Earlier this month, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed other corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin relating to a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. Lawyers for Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawyer-for-ex-thailand-pm-jailed-for.php">have been jailed</a> [JURIST report] for attempting to bribe court officials in one of Thaksin&#39;s cases, and current Thai <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] is <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">facing possible impeachment proceedings</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] due in part to his party&#39;s close association with Thaksin  .

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced Wednesday that a Native American prisoner in Wyoming had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/discrim/36211prs20080730.html">settled his lawsuit</a> [ACLU press release] against the Wyoming Department of Corrections after Department officials agreed to allow the man to keep up to four eagle feathers in his cell for religious purposes. Andrew John Yellowbear, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, was incarcerated in the <a href="http://corrections.wy.gov/institutions/wsp/index.html">Wyoming State Penitentiary</a> (WSP) [official website] in 2006 after <a href="http://www.trib.com/articles/2006/06/02/news/top_story/717fb41dd7d8059387257181000364de.txt">receiving a life sentence</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Star-Tribune</span> report] for the murder of his daughter. He alleged in his <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-wydce/case_no-2:2008cv00013/case_id-17264/">suit</a> [docket] that he was only allowed one eagle feather in his cell even though Department <a href="http://corrections.wy.gov/Media.aspx?mediaId=48">policy</a> [text, PDF] allows for more, and that WSP officials confiscated that one feather after he filed the lawsuit, all in violation of the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am1.html">First Amendment</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Equal Protection Clause</a> and the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/housing/housing_rluipa2.htm">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [texts]. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/discrim/35915prs20080709.html">agreed to represent him</a> [press release] earlier this month, and ACLU staff attorney Stephen Pevar said of the settlement: <blockquote>The fact that officials at WSP will now ensure that American Indian prisoners have access to eagle feathers is a great victory for religious freedom. The feathers are used to communicate prayers to the Creator and to receive answers to prayers. Denying Mr. Yellowbear these highly spiritual feathers was akin to denying Catholics access to a rosary or crucifix.</blockquote> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Casper Star-Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2008/07/31/news/wyoming/c09b330beed0374d872574960004ad22.txt">more</a>.<br /><br />Yellowbear had initially petitioned the US Fish and Wildlife Service&#39;s <a href="http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/law/eagle/">National Eagle Repository</a> [official website] for 10 feathers, the most allowed under law. Under US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/668.html">law</a> [16 USC s. 668 text], only the National Eagle Repository may distribute bald and golden eagle feathers, and petitioners for the feathers must be enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe seeking them for religious purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia Thursday <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Miers%20Bolton%20opinion_0.pdf">rejected arguments</a> [opinion, PDF; CREW <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/node/33606">press release</a>] that senior White House officials are protected from congressional subpoena by executive privilege, ruling that former White House legal counsel <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/hmiers-bio.html">Harriet Miers</a> [official profile] must testify before a House committee regarding the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">US Attorneys firing scandal</a> [JURIST news archive].  Judge John Bates did find that Miers may claim executive privilege in response to certain questions, but he ordered Miers and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/bolten-bio.html">White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten</a> [official profile] to turn over all documents requested by the subpoena and a list of any documents withheld under executive privilege. Bates wrote: <blockquote>[E]xecutive privilege is not absolute even when Congress -- rather than a grand jury -- is the party requesting the information. And a claim of absolute immunity from compulsory process cannot be erected by the Executive as a surrogate for the claim of absolute executive privilege already firmly rejected by the courts. Presidential autonomy, such as it is, cannot mean that the Executive&#8217;s actions are totally insulated from scrutiny by Congress. That would eviscerate Congress&#8217;s historical oversight function.</blockquote> Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200807/073108b.html">said</a> [press release] in response to the opinion that the Bush administration&#39;s use of executive privilege has only allowed it to hide its &quot;inappropriate and illegal actions,&quot; and US House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) also lauded the decision, <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/073108.html">saying</a> [press release] that the ruling is a reaffirmation the governmental system of checks and balances. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN3132685720080731">more</a>.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hq-4ZBiiUcq8IsbGQ0SHW04WS4kgD928V0183">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February, members of the House <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-house-votes-to-hold-miers-bolten-in.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to hold Miers in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Contempt_of_Congress">contempt of Congress</a> [Cornell Law backgrounder] for failing to testify and both Miers and Bolten in contempt for refusing to produce documents related to the 2006-2007 firings. The White House has said that the information sought in the inquiry is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/11/20071105-2.html">protected by executive privilege</a> [press briefing transcript] and that both Miers and Bolten are immune from prosecution.  In March, the House Judiciary Committee filed a <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/Media/PDFS/ContemptComplaint080310.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/newscenter.aspx?A=933">press release</a>] to enforce subpoenas seeking information from Miers and Bolten regarding the US Attorneys firing scandal.   On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN3046458020080730">voted to hold Karl Rove in contempt</a> [Reuters report] for defying a subpoena to testify about the alleged politicization of the Department of Justice.

In March, a Tenth Circuit panel <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/07/07-1311">struck down</a> [ruling, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-orders-new-trial.php">report</a>]  Nacchio&#39;s conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that US District Judge Edward Nottingham improperly excluded testimony from defense witness <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/fischel">Daniel Fischel</a> [academic profile], a corporate law and markets expert scheduled to present information on public disclosure requirements for Nacchio&#39;s stock sales.  Nacchio had appealed his April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/former-qwest-ceo-convicted-of-insider.php">insider trading conviction</a> [JURIST report] for selling $52 million of Qwest stock in 2001 based on non-public information shortly before the stock sharply dropped in value.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.concourt.gov.za/">South African Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/cgisirsi/20080731170415/SIRSI/0/520/J-CCT89-07">rejected a motion</a> [opinion, PDF; opinion <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/zuma8907.htm">summary</a>] by politician <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>] to exclude evidence from his upcoming corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/ReadContent424.aspx">Directorate of Special Investigations</a> [official backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/435550.stm">report</a>] should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the validity of the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal, explaining: <blockquote>[T]he application for the warrants, the terms of the warrants themselves, and their subsequent execution were lawful, in view of the applicable common-law, statutory and constitutional principles. For that reason, although the applications for leave to appeal are granted, the appeals themselves are refused and the judgments of the Supreme Court of Appeal appealed against are confirmed.</blockquote> The court also <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/hyperion-image/J-CCT90-07">held</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/zuma9007.htm">summary</a>] that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/south-africa-court-prosecutors-may-seek.php">papers obtained by the Mauritius government</a> [JURIST report] believed to document meetings between Zuma and arms manufacturer Thint were also admissible.   Reuters has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/07/31/africa/OUKWD-UK-SAFRICA-ZUMA.php">more</a>.  The <em>Mail and Guardian</em> has <a href="http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-07-31-setback-for-zuma-after-court-ruling">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures. In December 2007, South Africa&#39;s <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> [official website] served an <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/south-africa-prosecutors-charge-zuma.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] on Zuma, charging him with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering related to alleged bribes received from Thint, a subsidiary of the France-based <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/">Thales Group</a> [corporate website]. His trial is scheduled to begin in August.   Zuma has said that the charges against him are part of a politically motivated effort by outgoing <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election.

Arthur would have been executed on Thursday.  The court did not disclose its reason for the stay, but the decision comes after lawyers for Arthur filed an affidavit in which another prisoner, Bobby Ray Gilbert, <a href="http://www.timesdaily.com/article/20080730/NEWS/807300322/1011">confessed to the murder</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Times Daily</font> report], and an assistant attorney general said the state could not find evidence that the defense had petitioned to test for DNA. The Innocence Project has <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/ip/site/Advocacy?JServSessionIdr010=23sxbeu842.app2a&cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=108">petitioned</a> [advocacy website] Alabama Governor Bob Riley to order DNA testing of the evidence, if found, in order to potentially clear Arthur of the charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] California Attorney General <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] formally <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1594_final_180_day_notice.pdf">notified</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1594">press release</a>] the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] Thursday that the state would file a lawsuit against the agency if it refused to issue rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from ships, aircraft, industrial and agricultural machinery, and other vehicles.  Brown said that California had petitioned the EPA three times seeking a regulatory ruling, but that the EPA had disregarded the requests other than to issue an <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/anpr.html">&quot;Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&quot;</a> (ANPR) [EPA materials] on July 11. The letter notes: <blockquote>Describing the petitions and soliciting comments does not suffice as a response to petitioners&#39; requests. Moreover, although the ANPR includes various feasible mechanisms for reducing emissions from marine vessels, aircraft and nonroad vehicles and engines, the recommendations are inadequate responses to our petitions. EPA suggests only that these tools are available, but does not recommend that any of the measures be adopted. EPA&#8217;s unresponsive actions evade the rendering of a judicially reviewable final action on the petitions simply to avoid accusations of delay. [Citations omitted]</blockquote> Brown said that if the EPA does not issue greenhouse restrictions within 180 days as required under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [text], California will file a complaint for unreasonable delay. Reuters has <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2008-07-31T083054Z_01_N30446776_RTRUKOC_0_US-CALIFORNIA-EMISSIONS.xml">more</a>.  AP has <a href="http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/UPDATES01/807310348">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last year the EPA <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/epa-denies-waiver-for-california-auto.php">denied a request for a waiver</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed California and 16 other states to impose stricter greenhouse gas emissions standards on cars and light trucks.  That was the first time that the EPA had denied California a waiver since Congress established the state&#39;s right to seek CAA waivers in 1967.  In January, California <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/california-sues-epa-over-auto-emissions.php">filed suit to appeal the denial</a> [JURIST report].  In May, a report by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/white-house-influenced-epa-in-emission.php">White House had influenced the EPA decision</a> [JURIST report].  Last month, the Bush administration <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/white-house-claims-executive-privilege.php">refused to turn over requested documents</a> [JURIST report] concerning the decision to the committee, citing executive privilege.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials for <a href="http://www.united.com/page/middlepage/0,6823,1358,00.html">United Airlines</a> [corporate website] filed a <a href="http://www.united.com/press/detail/0,6862,59689,00.html">lawsuit</a> [press release] Wednesday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking to ban pilots&#39; union <a href="http://www.alpa.org/">Air Line Pilots Association</a> (ALPA) [official website] and four pilots from causing flight cancellations. The suit alleges that ALPA and the pilots have organized sick-leave abuse movements in protest to United <a href="http://www.united.com/press/detail/0,6862,59665,00.html">plans</a> [press release] to reduce the size of its fleet and lay off employees in response to increasing fuel prices. The movements have reportedly contributed to a summer increase of as much as 103 percent in first-officer sick leave time, and United asked the court for an injunction against such actions. United executive vice president Pete McDonald commented: <blockquote>It is absolutely irresponsible for ALPA to promote unlawful behavior, particularly in this environment, when the industry is taking unprecedented actions to offset record fuel costs. Our employees are working hard to make our company successful. We are going to ensure the integrity of our operation and will not allow the actions of ALPA and certain pilots to continue to harm our customers, our employees and our company.</blockquote> ALPA officials <a href="http://www.alpa.org/DesktopModules/ALPA_Documents/ALPA_DocumentsView.aspx?itemid=15444&ModuleId=12567&Tabid=73">responded</a> [press release] that they are reviewing the suit but that the United press release includes &quot;inaccurate and alarmingly misleading information.&quot; The <span style="font-style: italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-thu-united-pilots-sickout-jul31,0,613227.story">more</a>.<br /><br />The federal government has recently been exploring ways to stop rising fuel prices. Earlier this month, US President George W. Bush issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-2.html">memorandum</a> [presidential statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-lifts-executive-order-banning.php">report</a>] lifting an executive ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last month, Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html">called on Congress to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">report</a>], saying that it should also allow drilling to begin in the <a href="http://arctic.fws.gov/">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> [official website] in Alaska.  Bush argued that resources currently off-limits to energy companies could offset rising fuel prices.  Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] in the Arctic, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require several years and a massive infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/index.htm">Australian Minister for Immigration and Citizenship Chris Evans</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/speeches/2008/ce080729.htm">announced</a> [speech transcript; <a href="http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/media-releases/2008/ce08072.htm">press release</a>] that the country will no longer impose mandatory detention on all those who enter the country seeking asylum. Evans said Tuesday that the country&#39;s existing immigration policy imposed detentions too broadly, held immigrants in unacceptable conditions, and that those who were detained often lacked means to challenge their detention. Making the announcement, he laid out what he called the seven &quot;values&quot; of the country&#39;s new approach, which he said would base the treatment of immigrants on the estimated risk they pose to the country&#39;s security:<ol><li> Mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control.<br /><Li> To support the integrity of Australia&#8217;s immigration program, three groups will be subject to mandatory detention:<br />a. all unauthorised arrivals, for management of health, identity and security risks to the community<br />b. unlawful non-citizens who present unacceptable risks to the community and<br />c. unlawful non-citizens who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions.<br /><li> Children, including juvenile foreign fishers and, where possible, their families, will not be detained in an immigration detention centre (IDC).<br /><li> Detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable and the length and conditions of detention, including the appropriateness of both the accommodation and the services provided, would be subject to regular review.<br /><li> Detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time.<br /><li> People in detention will be treated fairly and reasonably within the law.<br /><li> Conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity of the human person</ol>AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iGlrDvgAts2JBV8zqYJwBfHq8Yug">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Australian</font> has <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24104583-5013871,00.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Australia&#39;s Federal Human Rights Commissioner <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/about/president_commissioners/innes.html">Graeme Innes</a> [official profile], a longtime opponent of the government&#39;s existing policies, <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/about/media/media_releases/2008/79_08.html">praised the announcement</a> [press release], saying it was a &quot;huge step&quot; towards bringing the country&#39;s policies in line with the typical treatment of asylum seekers elsewhere. An opinion article in Melbourne daily <font style="font-style: italic;">The Age</font> also <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/protection-should-be-paramount-20080730-3ncr.html?page=-1">welcomed the changes</a> [op-ed], but said they did not go far enough, and still gave the government too much control over the liberty of those seeking refuge in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200807/07-5276-1130154.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a lower court had erroneously dismissed a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit seeking to prevent <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods Market</a> [corporate website] from buying out competitor Wild Oats Markets. The FTC had been seeking a temporary injunction against the merger while it conducted an investigation into whether the deal would violate <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/18.html">antitrust laws</a> [15 USC s. 18 text]. The FTC argued that the merger could give Whole Foods a monopoly on a specific high-end grocery market in some areas, but the lower court found that this could not qualify as a &quot;market&quot; under the law and dismissed the claim. Over objections from Whole Foods that the deal had <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/wildoats/">effectively already gone through</a> [corporate website], the circuit court ordered the lower court to more fully consider whether the kind of &quot;market&quot; the groceries control is one that is protected from monopolies under the law: <blockquote>The FTC contended Whole Foods and Wild Oats are the two largest operators of what it called premium, natural, and organic supermarkets (&#8220;PNOS&#8221;). Such stores &#8220;focus on high- quality perishables, specialty and natural organic produce, prepared foods, meat, fish and bakery goods; generally have high levels of customer services; generally target affluent and well educated customers [and] . . . are mission driven with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility. ...<br /><br />The FTC described the core PNOS customers, explained how PNOS cater to these customers, and showed these customers provided the bulk of PNOS&#8217;s business. The FTC put forward economic evidence&#8212;which the district court ignored&#8212;showing directly how PNOS discriminate on price between their core and marginal customers, thus treating the former as a distinct market. Therefore, we cannot agree with the district court that the FTC would never be able to prove a PNOS submarket. </blockquote> Reuters has <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/partiesNews/idUKN2933499620080730">more</a>.<br /><br />The decision comes after the court initially <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-whole.php">refused to block the merger</a> [JURIST report] over US District Judge Paul Friedman&#39;s <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv1021-171">refusal to issue an injunction blocking the acquisition</a> [opinion, PDF] in 2007, which the FTC had <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ftc-appeals-ruling-allowing-whole-foods.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the circuit court. The court initially <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-appeals-court-puts-hold-on.php">issued an administrative injunction</a> [JURIST report] putting the takeover on hold while it considered the case, but later <a href="http://www.wholefoods.com/investor/pr07_08-23.html">refused the FTC request for a stay pending appeal</a> [WF press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/Welcome.shtml">House of Representatives</a> [official website] late Tuesday approved by voice vote a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.RES.194:">resolution</a> [HR 194 materials] apologizing to African Americans for slavery and <a href="http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/scripts/jimcrow/courtcases.cgi?casetype=Segregation">Jim Crow laws</a> [backgrounder]. The resolution declares:<blockquote>That the House of Representatives--<br /><br />(1) acknowledges that slavery is incompatible with the basic founding principles recognized in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal;<br /><br />(2) acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow;<br /><br />(3) apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow; and<br /><br />(4) expresses its commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against African Americans under slavery and Jim Crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future.</blockquote>The measure was drafted by <a href="http://cohen.house.gov/">Rep. Steve Cohen</a> (D-TN) [official website], who lauded the resolution&#39;s passage as a <a href="http://cohen.house.gov/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=590">step forward for racial reconciliation</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.cq.com/floorvideo/play.do?id=0dcff55f1c0da8509fcdf36b75d46eddd761987460da3beb11045f6515deda92bc0095b10fb21e905a69af4817c47fc87eb3e8c45427fb02d764ab5d8fa72509332802b300a2c183">recorded video</a>].

Proponents described the legislation as &quot;unprecedented,&quot; although Congress has previously issued other apologies to <a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/archive/resources/documents/ch30_06.htm">Japanese-Americans detained during World War II</a> and <a href="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/publawall.html">Native Hawaiians for the conquest of Hawaii</a> [texts].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> [official website] Tuesday voted 119-36 for a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/185/ht01pdf/ht01710.pdf">bill</a> [HB 1710 petition, PDF] that would repeal a 1913 law barring people from marrying in Massachusetts if their own state would not recognize such a union. The state&#39;s Senate <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-senate-repeals.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month and Massachusetts Governor <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3utilities&sid=Agov3&U=Agov3_Deval_Patrick_welcome_msg">Deval Patrick</a> [official website] has said he will sign it into law when it reaches his desk. The original <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/207-11.htm">statute</a> [text] gained attention because it has the effect of preventing most out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts because most states do not allow the unions. In 2006, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/breaking-news-massachusetts-high-court.php">upheld the 1913 law</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.glad.org/marriage/Cote-Whitacre/CWDecision.pdf"><em>Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health</em></a> [opinion, PDF] against a legal challenge, but the new law will take precedence if enacted. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hZmLBrL36NObNyMR0ghXN7vB5hYwD927PI0G1">more</a>.<br /><br /><a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-same-sex-marriages-begin-as.php">California</a> [JURIST news reports] are the only two US states to formally recognize same-sex marriages, and if Tuesday&#39;s bill is signed into law, neither state will impose residency restrictions on couples. Many states have banned same-sex unions through statutes or amendments, but several states besides Massachusetts and California do permit same-sex <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive]. In May, New York Governor David Paterson <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/Nocenti_Order_05.14.08.pdf">ordered</a> [memo, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/new-york-to-recognize-out-of-state-same.php">report</a>] that state agencies recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages as legal marriages in New York.
