The Church has opposed the new law <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-29/an-philippines-reproduction/4447026">arguing</a> [ABC report] that it undermines the value of marriage and increase promiscuity. Critics view the new law as ineffective to control the country's fast growing population. In response, Philippine <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/biography/">President Benigno Aquino</a> [official profile] urged supporters and opposition, including the Church, to <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/international/30-Dec-2012/philippines-birth-control-law-signed">find alternative ways</a> [AFP report] to resolve the differences. The new law, which had been pending for 13 years, establishes mandatory sex education in schools and government funding for contraceptives and family planning services, and also guarantees all individuals the right to receive reproductive health care information. Aquino signed the bill into law on December 21 after both chambers of the parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-legislature-approves-reproductive-health-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] it two days earlier. The law is expected to go into effect in mid-January.

<p>The right to sex education and contraceptives and associated funding concerns continues to be a global issue. In October, France <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to pay for contraceptive and abortion coverage for minors. A day earlier, a US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rehear a Texas Planned Parenthood funding case. In September an Illinois appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/illinois-appeals-court-rules-pharmacists-can-refuse-to-dispense-birth-control-drugs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that pharmacists can refuse to dispense birth control drugs. In May the <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">Tennessee House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill that augments the state's abstinence-only sex education curriculum to allow parents to sue school teachers or organizations that promote <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tennessee-legislature-passes-abstinence-only-sex-education-bill.php">"gateway sexual activity"</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-high-court-rejects-religious.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] on religious grounds to mandatory sex education. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban also added that UN entities such as the <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official website] are prepared to assist the country in adopting and enhancing measures to protect sexual assault victims. Ban condemned the recent crime and noted that violence against women should not be tolerated. The deceased was <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/29/16230911-india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-victim-of-horrific-gang-rape-dies?lite">gang raped on a bus</a> [NBC report] in New Delhi on December 16 and died in a Singapore hospital last week. Local authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] six men, five between 20 and 40 years of age and one under the age of 18, with the murder of the student. Several entities and groups have urged the government to take measures to protect sexual assault victims. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/112230">called for new laws</a> [report, text] that would achieve such a goal. The six men could face harsh penalties including the death penalty. 

<p>India has been the focal point of several recent controversies concerning rape and sexual rights. Last week India <a href="http://pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-prime-minister-calls-for-peace-after-rape-protests.php">called for peace</a> [JURIST report] after a protest over sexual violence resulted in a clash between protesters and police.

The rule <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/31/us/texas-planned-parenthood/index.html">denies funding</a> [CNN report] to any organization participating in the state's <a href="http://www.texaswomenshealth.org/">Women's Health Program</a> [official website] that also performs abortions. Planned Parenthood had sought an injunction against implementation of the rule. Planned Parenthood has brought three lawsuits over the rule, arguing that it violates constitutional and state law. Another hearing with a different judge is scheduled for January 11, at which time Planned Parenthood will again ask for an injunction on the rule to permit them to receive state funding.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. Last October the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined to reconsider</a> its August decision to allow Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">defund Planned Parenthood</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law that would block Medicaid funding for abortion providers earlier that same month. Also in October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">blocked a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood in Arizona. In August the Fifth Circuit upheld Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">revoke an abortion clinic's license</a> [JURIST report] immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. That same month a Kansas judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-lawsuit-challenging-abortion-clinic-regulations.php">refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's new abortion clinic regulations after state officials asked that they be upheld without a trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Roberts noted that the judiciary has been receiving only a small percentage of the federal budget to maintain its operations. He also described how the judiciary, as a result, has aggressively tried to cut costs since 2011 despite inflation, budget deficits and increased costs to maintain adequate service to the public. Notwithstanding the cuts and cost saving measures, however, Roberts went on to state that it has been increasingly difficult to cut additional costs while maintaining the judiciary's core functions that are "constitutionally and statutorily required" and still addressing the increasing caseloads of the courts. Unlike the executive branch, which has discretionary programs that it can either postpone or terminate, the judiciary must take cases that are within its jurisdiction. Roberts therefore stressed that justice would be undermined if insufficient funding for the judiciary continues, and encouraged President Obama and Congress to consider appointing additional judges to maintain the rule of law.

<p>It is not the first time Roberts has asked the president and Congress to provide additional resources for the judiciary. In 2008 Roberts <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/roberts-presses-calls-for-judicial-pay.php">pressed for raises for federal judges</a> [JURIST report] in his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary that year. As in the recent report he detailed steps that have been taken by the judiciary to reduce spending on rent, personnel and information technology and insisted that its members' requests were modest. In 2007 Roberts <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/roberts-again-urges-salary-increase-for.php">called for judicial pay raises</a> [JURIST report] in accordance with pending legislation. In his <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/roberts-calls-lack-of-pay-hike-for.php">2006 report</a> [JURIST report], Roberts declared that raises were necessary to keep up with private-sector salaries and to maintain the quality and independence of federal judges. Roberts' <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/roberts-calls-for-judicial-pay-raise.php">first annual report</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 contained similar requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The focus of her criticism was the impeachment proceeding against Sri Lankan Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-to-begin-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in early November. Knaul condemned the removal procedure because it was "extremely politicized and characterized by lack of transparency, lack of clarity in the proceedings, as well as lack of respect for the fundamental guarantees of due process and fair trial." Knaul noted that such procedures, especially article 107 of the country's constitution, which allows the parliament to govern judiciary matter, violate the principle of separation of powers, due process and international standards. She urged the local government to reassess the impeachment of the chief justice, which should be determined by an independent committee to ensure the independence of the judiciary by preventing it from being subject to external influences.

<p>In mid-December Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her conviction arguing that she was not given adequate opportunity to present her defense. She asked to declare the committee's findings illegal and order parliament to suspend any further proceedings against her, pending appeal. She was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of three, out of five, charges of misconduct by the parliamentary committee earlier that month. The first charge was related to a conflict of interest claim. The fourth charge dealt with claiming of assets for tax purposes. The fifth charge was a claim of bias in dealing with a case against her husband. The second and third charges were dismissed. More than 300 of Sri Lanka's judges had met in the capital Colombo to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lankan-judges-demand-impartial-inquiry-into-charges-against-chief-justice.php">call for impartiality</a> [JURIST report] in the impeachment proceedings. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-ensure-safety-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to take appropriate measures to protect the country's judiciary from threats, intimidation and physical attacks. Earlier last month hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation has been previously approved by both the <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] and the <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/eng/index.html">Federation Council</a> [official website]. The newly enacted legislation requires a mandatory course to teach the fundamentals of religion. The cost of kindergarten programs are to be assessed by each municipality independently, allowing each institution to determine whether to reduce the cost of care for certain families. The legislation also mandates that the minimum salary for teachers will be proportionate to the average salary of the economical region of their employment. Additionally, educators who live in rural communities are to be compensated for their utility expenses. Many educators protested the legislation, claiming the law would decrease the number of small rural schools and induce new fees for education. The law is effective on September 1, 2013.

<p>Other recently passed laws in Russia have raised controversy in recent months. In July, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that labels all non-governmental organizations that engage in political activity as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry before receiving any foreign funding. Also in July, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-politicians-ask-constitutional-court-to-review-protest-legislation.php">Russian politicians asked</a> [JURIST report] the country's constitutional court to review a recently passed law that increases penalties against protesters who violate regulations. Earlier in July, the Duma <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russian-parliament-adopts-controversial-internet-regulation-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the third reading of a controversial Internet regulation bill. The online encyclopedia Wikipedia had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-wikipedia-shuts-down-site-to-protest-controversial-internet-regulation-bill.php">shut down its site</a> [JURIST report] in a one-day protest of the legislation, which it said in an article "may become the basis for real censorship on the internet." In May prominent Russian gay rights activist Nikolai Alekeyev became the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/russia-gay-activist-first-to-be-convicted-under-controversial-city-ordinance.php">first to be convicted</a> [JURIST report] under a St. Petersburg city ordinance that prohibits the spreading "homosexual propaganda" to minors. People who oppose the new law, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced in November</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST reports] in April, claim it will prevent gay rights groups from being able to assemble in public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement was made after the ambassador met with President of the Chamber of Deputies <a href="http://www.lebanonembassyus.org/country_lebanon/berri.html">Speaker Nabih Berri</a> [embassy profile] to discuss "the political and security situation in Lebanon and regional events, particularly in Syria." During the meeting, the Ambassador "renewed the commitment of the United States to a stable, sovereign and independent Lebanon."

<p>Current changes reflect a critical moment in the history of Lebanese government. In November 2011, US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] urged militant group Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/us-urges-hezbollah-not-to-impede-lebanon-tribunal.php">not to resort to violence</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to impede the investigation of the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official website], which is investigating the 2005 murders of former Lebanese Prime Minister <a href="http://www.rhariri.com/">Rafik Hariri</a> [official website] and 22 others. In an interview published by the Lebanese Newspaper <a href="http://www.annahar.com/?type=main&table=main&day=Sat">An-Nahar</a> [official website], Clinton reiterated US support for Lebanon and noted that the work of the STL is "legitimate and necessary." She also stressed the independence of the tribunal and that "no one knows what the Special Tribunal is going to do, who it might indict, or when it might choose to move forward." Clinton's interview followed remarks made by Hezbollah leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile], who said he would "cut off the hands" of any person attempting to arrest a Hezbollah member in connection with the murder. Nasrallah has previously called for all Lebanese to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/hezbollah-leader-calls-for-boycott-of-un-backed-lebanon-tribunal.php">boycott the STL</a> [JURIST report] after information surfaced suggesting that the tribunal is set to implicate members of Hezbollah as participants in the assassination of Hariri.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/01/03/892743/rh-law-goes-sc">petition for injunction was filed</a> [<em>Philippine Star</em> report] by James Imbong, son of the legal counsel for the <a href="http://cbcponline.net/v2/">Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines</a> (CBCP) [official website], one of the groups opposing the new law. In his petition, Imbong claims that least 11 provisions of the legislation violate the Constitution, including <a href="http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-ii/">Article II Section 12</a> [text] which maintains that, "the State recognizes the sanctity of family life and shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution."

<p>The Catholic Church remains an influential institution in the Philippines where 80 percent of the population is Catholic. Last week the Church announced it would challenge the Reproductive Health law, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-catholic-church-to-challenge-reproductive-health-law.php">arguing</a> [JURIST report] that it undermines the value of marriage and increases promiscuity. The new law, which had been pending for 13 years, establishes mandatory sex education in schools and government funding for contraceptives and family planning services, and also guarantees all individuals the right to receive reproductive health care information. Philippine <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/biography/">President Benigno Aquino</a> [official profile] signed the bill into law on December 21 after both chambers of the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-legislature-approves-reproductive-health-bill.php">parliament approved</a> [JURIST report] it two days earlier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Samsung had <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-02/samsung-loses-bid-to-seal-sales-data-in-apple-dispute.html">sought to delay</a> [Bloomberg report] the implementation of a December 10 ruling by Judge Lucy Koh until its appeal is heard by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The order requires Samsung to file an exhibit which lists the total number of units of certain Samsung products sold during certain time periods. In addition, Koh denied a number of requests by both parties seeking to seal documents, stating that there was a lack of "compelling reason" that would require sealing. Samsung, in a separate order, was granted a request to delay publication of a document detailing the per-unit operating profit for two unidentified Samsung phones, pending Samsung's appeal of an earlier sealing order. 

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. Last month Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/apple-withdraws-patent-claim-against-samsung.php">revealed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to withdraw patent claims against Samsung in the US District Court for Northern California for a new Samsung phone, Galaxy S III Mini, that the South Korea-based company said it was not offering for sale in the US market. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/english/Pages/default.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung did <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple software patent. That same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung did <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed its patents. At the beginning of October the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus. In August Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, the average number of deaths per month has increased significantly since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 deaths per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012. However, the study noted that 60,000 is likely an underestimate and that the actual death toll may be significantly higher. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] stated that "the number of casualties is higher than expected, and is truly shocking." While she cautioned that the figure is not "definitive," she said that the report is the "most detailed and wide-ranging to date." Pillay noted that both sides have committed crimes against humanity and that the sectarian nature of the conflict will make any resolution difficult to achieve. She also called upon the international community to prepare for the "inevitable instability" that will take place once the conflict ends.

<p>The Syrian government has been engaged in a bloody conflict with numerous <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15798218">opposition groups</a> [BBC backgrounder] since March 2011 when nationwide protests opposing the government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=president+bashar+assad">President Bashar Assad</a> [JURIST news archive] began. US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archive] has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/us/obama-says-us-will-recognize-syrian-rebels.html">formally recognized</a> [NYT report] the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the country's legitimate representative. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/syindex.aspx">Commission of Inquiry</a> (COI) [official website] released its latest <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/syria-rights-violations-persist-un-update.php">periodic update</a> [JURIST report] on the conflict, finding persistent violence and human rights abuses and that civilians have "borne the brunt" of the conflict. In October Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">called on the international community</a> to bring an end to the violence in Syria.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While Apple claims that Amazon <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/02/us-apple-amazon-ruling-idUSBRE9010GA20130102">misused</a> [Reuters report] the phrase to solicit developers, Amazon counters that the phrase has become commonplace and that its use is not false advertising. In granting Amazon's partial motion for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-02/amazon-wins-dismissal-of-apple-s-false-advertising-claim.html">summary judgment</a> [Bloomberg report], Judge Phyllis Hamilton said that Apple had not shown that Amazon deliberately mislead consumers. Wednesday's ruling applies only to Apple's false advertising claim, and Apple's other claims, including trademark infringement, have not been dismissed. Trial for the remaining claims is scheduled for August. 

<p>Apple has also been engaged in litigation with <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] in courts around the world. According to some <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">commentators</a> [JURIST op-ed], Apple's legal strategy has been an effort to influence the marketplace from the courtroom. Earlier this week a US judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-denies-samsung-request-to-keep-sales-data-sealed.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Samsung's request to keep sales data from some of its products sealed in its patent dispute with Apple. In October, a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung did not infringe on an Apple design patent. That same month, a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Samsung in a design infringement case, and the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product.

The request had been filed by <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> [media website] in 2010. They argued that because the government made public statements about target killings, it had waived the right of immunity under the FOIA's exemptions for classified and privileged materials. The judge declined to accept this argument reasoning that there has been no official disclosure pertaining to documents detailing target killing operations. Rather, the statements concerned the fact that those operations took place. In addition, the plaintiffs claimed that the government failed to conduct a reasonable search for documents requested under the FOIA. As with plaintiffs' first argument, Judge Colleen McMahon denied this argument also holding that the government satisfies the requirement by "demonstrating, through affidavits or declarations, that it has conducted 'a search ... reasonably calculated to discover the requested documents.'" In conclusion, McMahon stated: <blockquote>However, this Court is constrained by law, and under the law, I can only conclude that the Government has not violated FOIA by refusing to turn over the documents sought in the FOIA requests, and so cannot be compelled by this court of law to explain in detail the reasons why its actions do not violate the Constitution and laws of the United States ... I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the Executive Branch of our Government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws, while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret. But under the law as I understand it to have developed, the Government's motion for summary judgment must be granted, and the cross-motions by the ACLU and the Times denied ...</blockquote>The ACLU has announced plans to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/court-dismisses-most-foia-lawsuit-targeted-killings-us-citizens">appeal</a> [press release] the decision.

<p>The court ruling came less than a month after the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/tk_govt_motion_to_dismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> [text, PDF] a separate lawsuit challenging drone strikes. Senior al Qaeda leader and US citizen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=awlaki">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">killed by drone strike</a> [JURIST report] last September along with another American, Samir Khan. Two weeks later drone strikes killed 16-year-old Abdulrahman Al-Awlaki, Anwar Al-Awlaki's son. Awlaki, a dual US-Yemeni citizen, had been approved for targeting killing by the Obama administration, an action that was challenged based on Awlaki's US citizenship. In December 2010 a judge for the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in al-Awlaki's case. Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the ACLU and the CCR on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain. Bates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November 2010 on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Earlier that month Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners, and he was later sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to 10 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsrilanka.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.lk/">Supreme Court of Sri Lanka</a> [official website] on Thursday ruled that the impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake were unlawful. The court held that the parliamentary committee does <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/us-srilanka-impeachment-idUSBRE90209D20130103">not have the authority</a> [Reuters report] to investigate or proceed with the impeachment of a senior judge; these tasks are left to the judiciary. Thus, by stepping into the judiciary's role, the parliament had exercised power beyond its authority, ultimately rendering the entire proceeding unlawful. The parliament has not yet commented on the ruling, but it is expected to make an announcement after next week's debate concerning Bandaranayake's impeachment.

<p>The decision comes only days after a UN independent expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the increasing threats and attacks against judges and lawyers who fight for the independence of the judiciary. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/GKnaul.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] called for the independence of the judiciary and criticized the parliament for exercising control over judicial matters, which violates the principle of separation of powers, due process and international standards. In mid-December Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her conviction arguing that she was not given adequate opportunity to present her defense. She asked to declare the committee's findings illegal and order parliament to suspend any further proceedings against her, pending appeal. She was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of three out of five charges of misconduct by the parliamentary committee earlier that month. More than 300 of Sri Lanka's judges had met in the capital Colombo to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lankan-judges-demand-impartial-inquiry-into-charges-against-chief-justice.php">call for impartiality</a> [JURIST report] in the impeachment proceedings. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-ensure-safety-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to take appropriate measures to protect the country's judiciary from threats, intimidation and physical attacks. Earlier last month hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which authorizes appropriations for military activities for 2013, expressly prohibits using funds to transfer individuals detained at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and also prohibits using funds to construct facilities in the US intended to house Guantanamo detainees. Obama signed the NDAA despite earlier <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf">indications that he may veto</a> [statement, PDF] the bill, in part because of concerns over the Guantanamo <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1111/White_House_threatens_veto_over_detainee_legislation.html">detainee restrictions</a> [Politico report]. Anthony Romero, executive director of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/updated-ndaa-prevents-closing-guantanamo-could-lead-claims-right-discriminate">criticized</a> [press release] Obama for signing the bill, stating that he has "utterly failed the first test of his second term" by effectively ensuring that indefinite detention will continue and jeopardizing his ability to keep his promise of closing the military prison. 

<p>During his 2008 campaign for the presidency, Obama pledged to close Guantanamo Bay, and during his second day in office, he issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing the prison to be closed. However, in the face of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-house-rejects-domestic-transfer-of.php">congressional opposition</a> [JURIST report], the Obama administration missed its self-imposed deadline to close the military prison, and, following the 2010 mid-term election, congress <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php#closure">effectively halted</a> [JURIST backgrounder] plans to close the facility. Thursday's signing of the NDAA will further hinder Obama's ability to close Guantanamo Bay, despite a recent <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/650032.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/government-report-guantanamo-detainees-could-be-safely-absorbed-by-us-prisons.php">report</a>] from the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/index.html">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) [official website] that Guantanamo detainees could be safely absorbed by prisons throughout the US. Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz argues that Obama <a href="/forum/2011/04/failing-to-close-guantanamo.php">bears responsibility</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the political missteps that prevented Guantanamo from closing and criticizes him for embracing the "larger detention system that Guantanamo embodies." Conversely, Forum contributor David Frakt agrees that the Obama administration is partially responsible, but believes <a href="/forum/2012/09/david-frakt-guantanamo-detainees.php">congress is largely to blame</a> [JURIST op-ed] for passing a "series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Under <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/news/2013/01/02/secretary-napolitano-announces-final-rule-support-family-unity-during-waiver-process">existing law</a> [press release], immediate relatives of US citizens who have been in the US illegally for more than six months must leave the US, obtain an immigrant visa abroad and obtain a waiver to overcome the bar on unlawful presence admissibility before they can return to the US. Under the new rule, immediate relatives must still leave the US but can apply for a provisional waiver before they depart. The goal of the new rule is to reduce the amount of time US citizens are separated from their immediate relatives and could <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-immigration-families-20130103,0,1743073.story">affect as many as one million</a> [LAT report] of the 11 million immigrants who are currently in the US unlawfully. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue over the past several years, and the announcement of the new rule on Wednesday is the latest effort by the Obama administration to affect immigration policy through executive directives. In October 2012 Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-mississippi-governor-phil-bryant.php">joined</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">policy directive</a> [DHS memorandum, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">report</a>] announced by the Obama administration that instructs immigration enforcement agencies not to enforce deportation laws against certain young people who were brought to the US as children but never became citizens. Shortly after the Obama administration announced this rule, Iowa <a href="http://steveking.house.gov/index.php">Congressman Steve King</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/iowa-congressman-to-sue-obama-over-new-illegal-immigration-policy.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] indicating his plans to sue the administration in order to delay implementation of the policy, and Arizona Congressman Ben Quayle <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-block-new-immigration-policy.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] to block enforcement of the policy. Additionally, a number of states have passed <a href="/feature/2012/04/immigration.php#state">restrictive immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] over the past several years, which give local authorities more autonomy to regulate immigration. However many of these laws have been partially blocked by federal courts, including those in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">Alabama and Georgia</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Transocean <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/transocean-plea-agreement.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [text, PDF] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [EPA summary] and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties. The civil penalty is a record amount, and, in accordance with the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act), 80 percent of the penalty will be used to fund projects in the Gulf states for the environmental and economic benefit of the region. Additionally, Transocean must take measures to reduce the likelihood of another oil discharge. Transocean still has a pending settlement with a committee representing more than 100,000 individuals and business owners claiming damages from the spill, and the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/uk-usa-transocean-settlement-idUKBRE9020H920130103">ultimate cost</a> [Reuters report] of the spill to Transocean could be $4 billion. 

<p>Thursday's settlement is the latest development in a series of legal battles over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill since January 2012 when a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] to share partial liability with Transocean in oil spill claims. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill.

Google's practice of favoring its own services in search results, to the detriment of its competitors, has been under scrutiny. Though Google will be required to make changes to its business practices that the FTC believes could stifle competition, the investigation did not produce evidence to justify legal action against the company, and the commission voted unanimously to close the investigation on Google's search-related practices. Thursday's announcement is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/technology/google-agrees-to-changes-in-search-ending-us-antitrust-inquiry.html">major victory</a> [NYT report] for Google in its ongoing dispute with regulators. 

<p>Google has faced numerous allegations regarding its business practices over the past several years, both in the US and abroad. Last month, an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a conviction against Google executives for privacy violations.

In February a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Google's privacy changes by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website].

The decision by Judge Army Col. James L. Pohl was issued on December 20 but was just released this week. The new requirements <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gitmo-trial-20130104,0,7557441.story">prevent</a> [LAT report] lawyers from sharing unclassified surveillance information, medical records, autopsy reports, the names of the military commission jurors, as well as other military and police information. This decision and earlier rulings by Pohl, siding with the US government, have been criticized by <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/">Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</a> [advocacy website] and a number of major news agencies. 

<p>This ruling follows a decision last month by Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-military-judge-upholds-request-to-censor-911-conspirators-testimony.php">approving</a> [JURIST report] the US government's request for a protective order effectively blocking the public's access to accused <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] conspirators' testimony regarding the alleged use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" by the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. In April Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/chief-guantanamo-judge-sets-trial-date-for-911-accused.php">assigned himself</a> [JURIST report] to preside over the tribunals of the five alleged plotters of the 9/11 terror attacks. Earlier in April the Department of Defense (DOD) <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/dod-refers-charges-against-911-suspects-to-military-commission.php">referred charges</a> [JURIST report] to Pohl against the five accused 9/11 plotters. The DOD announced last year that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/military-prosecutors-bring-charges-against-911-suspects.php">sworn charges against the five men</a> [JURIST report]. In April 2011 US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four others would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military commission</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration abandoned attempts to have the 9/11 suspects tried in civilian courts. Holder had wanted the accused be tried before a federal civilian court but referred the cases to the DOD after Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">imposed a series of restrictions </a>[JURIST reports] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new rules had been proposed by the conservative <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Fidesz</a> [party website, in Hungarian] party of <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/prime-minister-s-office">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official website]. The new electoral law was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20909038">passed</a> [BBC report] by the <a href="http://www.mkogy.hu/">Hungarian Parliament</a> [official website, in Hungarian] last November but was referred to the Constitutional Court by <a href="http://www.keh.hu/president_janos_ader/1582-Curriculum_vitae_of_Janos_Ader">President Janos Ader</a> [official profile]. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/us-hungary-voting-idUSBRE9030C220130104">found</a> [Reuters report] that the law unduly restricts voting rights, as it would have required eight million citizens to register to vote at least two weeks before the election, a major departure from the current system that allows individuals to be identified from an existing state-run database at polling places on election day. The court also objected to provisions that would restrict political ads.

<p>Alleged government violations of freedom of press and speech have been a recurring issue in Hungary. Last May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/05/25/hungary-new-laws-curb-media-freedom">criticized the Hungarian government</a> [press release] for ignoring recommendations by the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] to change its media laws that allegedly curtail press freedom. In December 2011 Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hungary-court-strikes-down-provisions-of-media-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] certain provisions of the media laws as an unconstitutional restraint on press freedom. Rights groups had urged Hungary to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">amend</a> [JURIST report] the media laws. The media laws created the <a href="http://nmhh.hu/">National Media and Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the law, the government could impose costly fines on broadcasters, newspapers and news websites if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the media authority. The Constitutional Court struck down provisions allowing the NMHH to regulate content in print and online media and limiting the rights of reporters to protect confidential sources.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Bahen <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2013/01/04/bc-firearms-unconstitutional.html">ruled</a> [CBC report] in the case of Glenn Harley Tetsuji Sheck, a 29-year-old male with no prior criminal record who was arrested by police and found with a loaded Glock 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun outside a Surrey restaurant in November 2010. The Canadian Criminal Code <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec95">stipulates</a> [&#167; 95(1)] that any party found guilty of possessing a loaded handgun shall be sentenced to a minimum imprisonment of three years. Sheck's defense lawyer argued that the mandatory sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the <a href="http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection/CH37-4-3-2002E.pdf">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], and Bahen <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-judge-disagrees-with-firearms-law/article6936940/">agreed</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report].

<p>In the previous two years the Ontario Superior Court has handed down separate rulings, <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2012/2012onsc602/2012onsc602.html">R. v. Smickle</a> and <a href="http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=nur&language=en&searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&path=/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc4874/2011onsc4874.html">R. v. Nur</a> [opinions], in which similar sentences were <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/canada-judge-refuses-to-impose-mandatory-minimum-sentence-in-handgun-case.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]. Such cases present a significant challenge to Canada's current mandatory minimum sentence requirements. According to a spokesman for British Columbia's criminal justice branch, the <a href="http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1332788662861/1332788724918">Canadian Crown</a> [official website] will be reviewing the decision to assess the appropriate next steps. Under section 1 of the Charter, the Crown may allow laws which restrict Charter rights as long as they can be "demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Colonel Kumar Lama, a 46-year-old officer currently serving in the UN mission in Sudan, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20914282">arrested</a> [BBC report] at his East Sussex home by <a href="http://content.met.police.uk/Home">Metropolitan Police</a> [official website] officers on Thursday. Lama <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20919827">appeared</a> [BBC report] before Westminster Magistrates' Court Saturday. District Judge Quentin Purdy ordered Lama to remain in custody until he appears at the Old Bailey in London on January 24. The charges stem from two separate incidents that allegedly occurred between April and May 2005, in the latter years of the war, at the Gorusinghe Army Barracks in Nepal. Police were permitted to arrest Lama under <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/134">section 134</a> [text] of the UK's Criminal Justice Act of 1988, which states that a public official may be arrested and charged with torture for intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering on another regardless if the act was committed in the UK or elsewhere. Nepalese government officials have already expressed opposition to the arrest, claiming violations of international law and jurisdictional sovereignty. 

<p>In October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/NP/OHCHR_Nepal_Conflict_Report2012.pdf">report</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">urging justice</a> for victims of international law violations that occurred during Nepal's civil war, a conflict that resulted in approximately <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">13,000 deaths</a> [JURIST reports] and 1,500 disappearances. The report cited unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and sexual assault as some of the major offenses to have occurred during that period. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and the <a href="http://www.icj.org">International Commission of Jurists</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/nepal-urged-not-to-impose-blanket-amnesty.php">urged Nepal</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/23/nepal-reject-amnesty-serious-crimes">reject blanket amnesty</a> [press release] plans for international crimes committed during the country's civil war. In the same month, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-urges-nepal-to-punish-war-crimes-increase-womens-rights.php">spoke</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.can.gov.np/en">Constituent Assembly of Nepal</a> [official website] about several human rights issues in the country, including a <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_250.pdf">reluctance to prosecute war crimes</a> and <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/resources/Documents/English/statements/DHC/2011_04_19_NWC_roundtable_DHC_remarks_E.pdf">insufficient progress increasing women's rights</a> [texts, PDF]. On several previous occasions, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-nepal-peace.php">OHCHR</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hrw-nepal-must-vigorously-investigate.php">HRW</a>  [JURIST reports] have both appealed to the government of Nepal to investigate human rights violations allegedly committed during the civil war. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-399.htm">Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/12-399-Petition-Appendix-REDACTED-OK-TO-PRINTArnold-Porter-LLP.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider whether the <a href = "http://www.nicwa.org/indian_child_welfare_act/">Indian Child Welfare Act</a> (ICWA) [materials] allows a non-custodial parent to block an adoption by their non-Indian partner. In this case, a woman put her baby, who was fathered by an American Indian, up for adoption. A South Carolina couple attempted to adopt the child, but once the biological father was notified about the adoption proceedings, he attempted to gain custody. The South Carolina Supreme Court <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Couple_v_Baby_Girl_Opinion_No_27148_2012_BL_192980_SC_July_26_201">ruled for the biological father</a> [opinion], stating that the federal ICWA, which seeks to keep American Indian children in their ethnic communities, supersedes South Carolina law. The court will examine not only whether the ICWA allows an American Indian parent to stop a non-American Indian parent from putting a child up for adoption, but also if the father's absenteeism when the mother gave birth and chose adoption gives him the rights of a parent under the ICWA.

<p>The court granted <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-167.htm">US v. Davila</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-167-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will consider what degree of error is required to vacate a guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_11">11(c)(1)</a> [text]. Anthony Davila pleaded guilty to conspiring to file fraudulent tax returns under the advice of his court-appointed lawyer. However, he requested different counsel early in the proceedings, because his lawyer offered no defense other than pleading guilty. In an <em>ex parte</em> hearing, a magistrate judge told Davila that he would not accept his request for change of counsel, because he also believed there was no option but to plead guilty: "[T]he only thing at your disposal that is entirely up to you is the two or three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. That means you've got to go to the cross. You've got to tell the probation officer everything you did in this case regardless of how bad it makes you appear to be because that is the way you get that three-level reduction for acceptance, and believe me, Mr. Davila, someone with your criminal history needs a three-level reduction for acceptance." The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Davila_664_F3d_1355_11th_Cir_2011_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] that this violated FRCP 11(c)(1) due to the "[t]he court" involving itself in plea discussions and vacated the plea.</p>

<p>The court will also hear <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-889.htm">Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann</a> [docket; <a href = "http://www.appellate.net/briefs/Tarrant_Water_Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will consider to what extent a state can go into another state's territory to utilize a river that flows through both states. The dispute in this case is between Texas using water from the portion of the <a href = "http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/T/TE025.html">Red River</a> [backgrounder] that runs in Oklahoma, analyzed under the <a href = "http://www.owrb.ok.gov/rrccommission/rrccommission.html">Red River Compact</a> [materials]. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href = "http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Tarrant_Regional_Water_Dist_v_Herrmann_656_F3d_1222_10th_Cir_2011">found</a> [opinion] for Oklahoma in the dispute, stating that: "[T]he Red River Compact insulates Oklahoma water statutes from dormant Commerce Clause challenge insofar as they apply to surface water subject to the Compact." </p>]]></content:encoded>

UNICEF reported that both pro-government and rebel forces have utilized children, and called for all groups to immediately stop involving children. They reported that as of December, approximately 2,500 children had been drawn into armed groups. They also reiterated that the recruitment and use of children under the age of 18 by armed groups is prohibited by international law and constitutes a war crime and crime against humanity for children under the age of 15.

<p>Children exposed to hostilities and other extreme situations where they are held to adult standards may experience potentially long-term negative impacts on their health and well-being. In August UNICEF said it had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/unicef-concerned-over-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-norther-mali.php">received reports</a> [JURIST report] that armed groups in Mali had recruited children for use in conflict zones. Children's Rights Researcher <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/alice-farmer">Alice Farmer</a> [profile] at <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] wrote that in many cases of asylum, children are presumed to be adults and are detained as such in countries such as Malta, <a href="/hotline/2012/08/alice-farmer-malta-children.php">despite UNICEF endorsements</a> [JURIST comment] of standards stating that migrants who enter age determination proceedings should be presumed children until shown otherwise. In June UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] issued a report detailing the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-sg-issues-report-on-violations-against-children-in-conflict-zones.php">violations committed against children in conflict zones</a> [JURIST report]. The report discussed conflicts in the CAR, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12011352">Afghanistan</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Afghanistan">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13164686">Chad</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chad">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094995">Sudan</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sudan">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14069082">South Sudan</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=South+Sudan">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13283212">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+Republic+of+Congo">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703856">Syria</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Syria">news archive</a>], and the situation of children in each country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The securities were sold by Washington Mutual bank and its subsidiaries which were ultimately acquired by JPMorgan in 2008. The suit alleges that the "the firms made misrepresentations in connection with the underwriting and subsequent sale of" the RMBS products. It further alleges that the firms responsible for originating the mortgages that formed the basis of the securities "systematically disregarded" underwriting guidelines. Finally, the lawsuit states, "The RMBS purchased by the Credit Unions suffered a significant drop in market value. The Credit Unions have sustained significant losses from those RMBS purchased despite the NCUA Board's mitigation efforts."

<p>Major banking firms have faced numerous lawsuits regarding their business practices. In December the NCUA brought a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/credit-union-agency-files-larges-suit-to-date-against-wall-street-firms.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for similar RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPMorgan. In July JPMorgan agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/jpmorgan-agrees-to-100-million-settlement-in-credit-card-case.php">$100 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June the firm was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-for-jpmorgan-settlement.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. The settlement followed JPMorgan's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/jpmorgan-chase-agrees-to-pay-$228-million-for-fraudulent-bidding-on-municipal-bonds.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] last July with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to pay $228 million to federal and state authorities. One month earlier JPMorgan again <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the SEC for misleading investors during the housing crises. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> [corporate website] agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">$550 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the SEC to resolve similar charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-charges-former-culture-minister.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] in September that Hosni had <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20130105-egypt-ex-minister-cleared-graft-judicial-source">illegally acquired $3 million</a> [AFP report] and had failed to account for $1.5 million. Hosni was referred to criminal court after an investigation by Egypt's Illicit Gains Authority in which the Hosni could not provide evidence demonstrating the sources of all of his wealth. Egypt's Illicit Gains Authority had also <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20130106/178603912.html">frozen Hosni's personal bank assets</a> [RIA Novosti report], arrested his property and demanded compensation for funds he had illicitly gained from the state. Hosni had faced a travel ban during the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in February 2011, which was lifted some time later. 

<p>Hosni is one of many former officials who have faced corruption trials since the end of Mubarak's 30-year regime. In August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, although their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud, using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market. Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] after an Egyptian court found him guilty of complicity to kill protesters. During the protests that resulted in the overturning of Mubarak's 30-year regime, Mubarak ordered government officials to use gunfire and other violent measures to subdue protesters, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">causing over 850 deaths</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law came in response to concerns of human trafficking in Tennessee and created criminal penalties for advertising commercial sex acts. Despite acknowledging that the state has an interest in preventing human trafficking and sex slavery, Judge John Nixon found the law <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130105/NEWS03/301050042/Federal-judge-says-new-TN-law-targeting-online-sex-ads-curbs-free-speech">violated free speech</a> [Tennessean report] by being overbroad. The ruling temporarily restrained enforcement of the law. It is unclear whether the state plans to appeal.

<p>Human trafficking has long been a concern in the US.

Currently, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah al-Sennussi are being held in custody in Libya.

In September Libya <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/libya-to-delay-trial-for-gaddafis-son-for-five-months.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] Saif al-Islam's trial for five months so the prosecution could obtain evidence from Libya's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi.

This decision further fuels the <a href="http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/world/article/Verdict-against-Sri-Lanka-chief-justice-quashed-4171884.php">dispute</a> [AP report] between the legislature and the judiciary, and raises <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jbc-y2Bk65ffBrVjyNp6m33HreNw?docId=CNG.0fcc5fb32018c0cd141df4a251abbac1.611">international concern</a> [AFP report] over the independence of the country's judiciary. The decision quashed a report by lawmakers last month finding the Chief Justice guilty of financial and professional misconduct, declaring her unfit to be justice. Bandaranayake has denied all of the allegations against her, claiming that she did not receive a fair hearing. Sri Lanka's Bar Association vowed to reject any replacements for the Chief Justice if she is denied a fair hearing. As a result of the Court of Appeals' decision in granting the writ sought by Chief Justice Bandaranayake, the Parliament may not lawfully continue pursuing impeachment proceedings against the Chief Justice.

<p>Last week the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-high-court-finds-impeachment-proceeding-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the impeachment proceedings against Bandaranayake were unlawful. The court held that the parliamentary committee does not have the authority to investigate or proceed with the impeachment of a senior judge; these tasks are left to the judiciary. Thus, by stepping into the judiciary's role, the parliament had exercised power beyond its authority, ultimately rendering the entire proceeding unlawful. The parliament had not yet commented on the ruling, but was expected to make an announcement after the debate concerning Bandaranayake's impeachment. The decision came only days after a UN independent expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the increasing threats and attacks against judges and lawyers who fight for the independence of the judiciary. </p>]]></content:encoded>

BOA has agreed to pay Fannie Mae $3.55 billion in cash and to repurchase $6.75 billion in outstanding residential mortgage loans, putting to rest a dispute that has lingered since the bottom fell out of the housing market in the 2008 financial crisis. Since that time Fannie Mae and its counterpart <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> [corporate website] have been pursuing repurchases on such loans that did not meet the firms' lending standards when originated. BOA will fund the settlement agreement through the $2.5 billion in representation and warranty reserves set aside for the fourth quarter of 2012, as well as other cash reserves, and still anticipates a small fourth-quarter profit. The settlement resolves substantially all of the remaining claims against BOA by Fannie Mae. BOA reached a similar agreement with Freddie Mac for $1.4 billion in 2011.

<p>In October <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/spotlight/bharara.html">US Attorney Preet Bharara</a> [official profile] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-sues-bank-of-america-for-1-billion-in-mortgage-fraud-case.php">$1 billion civil lawsuit against BOA</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website], with similar claims that BOA subsidiary Countrywide Financial committed fraud in originating residential mortgages. In September BOA <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bank-of-america-settles-class-action-suit-over-merrill-lynch-acquisition.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a $2.43 billion class action lawsuit with investors over their $18.5 billion acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In July BOA agreed to pay <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/bank-of-america-settles-bond-insurer-lawsuit-for-375-million.php">$375 million</a> [JURIST report] in a settlement with bond insurer <a href="http://www.syncora.com/?site_id=2">Syncora Guarantee</a> [corporate website] over claims that Syncora was misled into insuring toxic mortgage-backed securities of Countrywide Financial. Also that month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-shareholder-lawsuit-against-bank-of-america.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by BOA to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging BOA's purposeful concealment of the bank's exposure to billions of dollars in loan repurchase claims and its problematic reliance on an electronic loan registry. In December BOA reached a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-315-million-to-settle-investor-claims-of-deceipt.php">$315 million settlement</a> of claims brought by investors alleging they were misled with respect to mortgage-backed investments, and a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-335-million-to-settle-discriminatory-lending-claims.php">$335 million settlement</a> [JURIST reports] with the Department of Justice, relating to discriminatory lending practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution completed its arguments on December 27. The court will return a verdict after the defense completes its arguments. Molla's plea was one of the first ones filed after Chief Justice Nizamul Huq stepped down over a controversy based on a conversation with an academic over skype. Molla is among several leaders of JI on trial for war crimes charges who have petitioned for a new trial, claiming that the trial procedures have been compromised. 

<p>Last month Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq, a judge for the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-judge-resigns.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position. Huq was the chairman of the tribunal's three-judge panel, and is a Justice for the High Court Division of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/scweb/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website]. His resignation followed recent allegations of impropriety. The report indicated that Huq ordered two journalists to appear before to explain how they obtained e-mails and recorded telephone conversations between an outside lawyer and himself. The journalists obtained the information in a wider investigation into the practices of the tribunal, the results of which they have yet to publish. The ICTB was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to handle war crimes charges stemming from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

North Carolina on Friday <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/files/Choose-Life-Notice-of-Appeal.pdf">announced plans to appeal</a> [text, PDF] a ruling finding "Choose Life" license plates unconstitutional. Judge James Fox of the <a href="http://www.nced.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wtvd/docs/NC_Choose_Life_Ruling_121012.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in December that "[t]he State's offering a 'Choose Life' license plate in the absence of a pro-choice alternative constitutes viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment." With the ruling, he also issued a permanent injunction to ban the production of the controversial license plates. The state plans to appeal to the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website]. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-north-carolina-pro-life-license-plates.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] was originally brought in September 2011 by the <a href="http://acluofnc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website]. ACLU-NCLF Legal Director Chris Brook <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/?q=north-carolina-appeals-judge%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cchoose-life%E2%80%9D-license-plate-ruling">commented</a> [press release] in response to the announcement:<blockquote>It's unfortunate that the state has chosen to prolong what is really a very clear-cut First Amendment issue. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has consistently ruled that any time the government creates an avenue for private speech, it cannot restrict that avenue to only one side of a contentious debate. This case is ultimately about the right of North Carolinians of all political beliefs to have equal access to avenues for the free expression of ideas, and we look forward to making our arguments before the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>The state's legislature has repeatedly refused license plates for pro-choice proponents, and denied six such amendments proposed to authorize an additional plate with sayings such as "Respect Choice."

<p>Fox <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">struck down</a> the "Choose Life" license plates in December after issuing an <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">injunction</a> [JURIST reports] the previous month. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">Abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] has remained a controversial issue in North Carolina. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">Woman's Right to Know Act</a> [HB 854 materials], which called for a 24-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and requiring women to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] by the state's governor. However, in July both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate </a>[JURIST reports] voted to override the veto. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed legislation is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/07/us-china-camps-idUSBRE90609S20130107">pending approval</a> [Reuters report] from China's <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/news/">National People's Congress</a> (NPC) [official website], which meets in March. From 1957 until the present, suspected criminals, religious dissidents and alleged social agitators have been sentenced without trial to work on farms and in factories for up to four years without conviction, access to legal assistance and with limited appeal. According to media sources, China currently detains approximately 160,000 prisoners in more than 300 camps throughout the country. While various humans rights and legal advocacy groups have praised the notion of abolishing forced labor in its entirety, experts and Chinese sources have expressed concern that the government merely intends to reform or replace the system to ensure stability. According to media sources, the proposal would represent the first major social reform by new Communist leader, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/x/xi_jinping/index.html">Xi Jinping</a> [NYT backgrounder], who is expected to take over the nation's presidency in 2013. 

<p>China has been known for its strict policy against dissidents. In June a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/china-court-rules-detention-of-blogger-was-illegal.php">quashed the sentence</a> [JURIST report] against a Chinese blogger and former forestry employee for lack of evidence. With the annulment of the sentence, the Chongqing Third Intermediate Court ruled that the one-year detention of Fang Hong in a police-run labor camp was illegal. Also in June dissident artist Ai Weiwei was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/china-dissident-artist-barred-from-attending-hearing.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] from attending the first hearing in the case brought by his company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd., against Beijing tax authorities, despite the fact that the Chinese court had <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-court-agrees-to-hear-dissident-artists-case.php">agreed to hear</a> [JURIST report] the case in early May. Filming and key witnesses were excluded from the courthouse while other rights activists such as Hu Jia were also barred from attending the hearing. In May the blind Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-activist-urges-us-to-push-for-rule-of-law-in-china.php">asked the US to increase its effort</a> in promoting the rule of law in China a week following his arrival in New York after <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-activist-leaves-us-embassy-after-escaping-house-arrest.php">he left the US embassy</a> [JURIST reports] in early May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of the 20 convicts <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-military-court-sentences-eight-activists-to-life-in-prison.php">eight received life sentences</a> [JURIST report], including human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17793857">Abdulhadi al-Khawaja</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdulhadi+al-Khawaja">news archive</a>], who last year demonstrated against his and the other convictions with a <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/bahrain-rights-activist-ends-hunger-strike.php">110-day hunger strike</a> [JURIST report]. The ruling of the Court of Cassation is final and cannot be further appealed.

<p>The National Safety Courts, special military tribunals, were instituted in March 2011 under <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa's</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">especially by human rights groups</a> [JURIST report] such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. In May HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/bahrain-must-free-protesters-immediately-hrw.php">urged Bahrain to release the remaining prisoners</a> [JURIST report] because the trial violated international fair trial standards in that the convictions were based on apparently coerced confessions and the individuals were merely engaged in peaceful protest.

Also in April Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/bahrain-government-has-failed-to-address-human-rights-violations-ai.php">issued its own report</a> [JURIST report] alleging human rights violations continue in Bahrain despite reforms.

Ordonez was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/member-of-basque-terrorist-group-arrested-in-scotland.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in July and has remained in custody of Scottish authorities since. Ordonez faces an additional extradition demand from Spain, which has accused him of being a member of ETA as well as moving men and supplies between France and Spain and gathering reconnaissance on police officers and politicians. Ordonez denies that he is a terrorist and had fought a five-month court battle against both extradition claims before ending his opposition of the French warrant in December. According to the BBC, French authorities have stated that Ordonez can apply for a new trial once he returns to France.

<p>Last year saw a large number of arrests of suspected ETA members throughout Europe.

Two months earlier a group of ETA prisoners <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eta-prisoners-call-for-end-to-separatist-violence-in-spain.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the ETA to stop violence and commit to a truce.

The first, <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-9540.pdf">Descamps v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF], concerned whether Matthew Descamps' burglary conviction under California law can allow a conviction under federal burglary law, which had slightly different requirements than California's statute. Federal judges used the "modified categorical approach" and looked at a limited number of documents to determine that Descamps was convicted of the elements of the generic crime under federal law. Thus, when Descamps was convicted of a federal felony, the government then translated his previous California crime to a federal one to increase his sentence under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> [text] (ACCA). Descamps' attorney argued that his client was deprived of having the federal crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the elements of California burglary are too removed from the federal elements, which were set out by the the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in <A href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Taylor_v_United_States_495_US_575_110_S_Ct_2143_109_L_Ed_2d_607_1">Taylor v. US</a> [opinion]. "In California, burglary&#8212;unlawful entry as defined by the Court in <span class = "casename">Taylor</span> on what a generic burglary consists of, is not an element of California burglary. Any entry with the intent to commit a crime, a theft, or a felony will do. A California jury is never required to actually find unlawful entry in the <span class = "casename">Taylor</span> sense." The United States government argued that, since Descamps pleaded guilty, he pleaded guilty to the generic crime of burglary, not the elements. "It's an unworkable distinction, because, from&#8212;from the point of view of the defendant pleading guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an alternative means, it's just an alternative way of offering the factual basis for the crime. And the sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this Court said in <span class = "casename">Shepard</span>, to the factual basis that's offered for pleading guilty."

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1450.pdf">The Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard its first case on the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ2/pdf/PLAW-109publ2.pdf">Class Action Fairness Act</a> (CAFA) [PDF], which put a number of class actions under federal jurisdiction. At issue here is whether, under the act, a class can avoid having a suit moved to federal court if it keeps the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1332">amount in controversy</a> [28 USC &#167; 1332] under $75,000 for each plaintiff. The Standard Fire Insurance Co. argued that the court must consider the plaintiffs' potential earnings in aggregate, and that Congress intended for the CAFA to avoid these sorts of abuses. "The Congress was very concerned that cases were being kept in the State courts through abuses and manipulations of the amount in controversy. It's very clear in the Senate report, Congress talks about this because, for example, in this case the defendants can never get a class certification hearing in Miller County." The attorney for Greg Knowles and the class he represents argued that "[o]ur position is that the stipulation is binding throughout the 'civil action filed by the putative class representative.' I want to focus on the words 'civil action' because there has been no civil action filed by any absent class members. The only civil action that the district court is being considered for jurisdiction is the civil action that has been filed by the putative class representative. So if the class is later not certified, the stipulation would only bind the putative class representative."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law in question prohibits comprehensive insurance plans from covering any abortion other than to save a woman's life but allows companies to offer a separate rider to cover abortions for an additional cost. Plaintiff <a href="https://aclukswmo.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri</a> (ACLU) [official website] had sought summary judgment, arguing that the statute's <em>purpose</em> is improper under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in that the Kansas legislature's predominant purpose in passing the legislation was to impede access to abortion care, not to serve legitimate state interests. The state responded with a cross motion denying such a purpose and further requesting summary judgment on the ACLU's additional claim that the law has the unconstitutional effect of imposing a substantial obstacle to obtaining abortions. Judge Julie Robinson granted summary judgment for the state on the question of unconstitutional purpose, removing the issue from the litigation. However, Robinson denied the state's motion regarding the law's unconstitutional effect, holding that the question creates a genuine issue of material fact concerning the number of women whose right to an abortion is unduly burdened by the legislation. According to the court, during the 2011 calendar year 7,851 reported abortions were performed in Kansas, and in a similar time span the three major health insurers in Kansas with a combined total of over 70 percent of the market share had a total of 137 paid claims for abortions.

<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">filed by the ACLU</a> [JURIST report] in 2011. In September of that year the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">denied the ACLU's request for an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to halt enforcement of the law while the litigation proceeds. <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website] signed HB 2075 into law in May 2011, one month after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed two other pieces of legislation</a> [JURIST report] restricting abortions in the state, specifically the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF], which requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF], which restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the controversial belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mohamed Sabry, a journalist and blogger, was arrested Friday by the country's military in the city of Rafah near the Egyptian-Gaza border. Sabry has been charged with trespassing and filming in a prohibited military zone. Under Article 198 of Egypt's <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated">new constitution</a> [text, in English], the trial of civilians in military courts is allowed when the crime is one that "harm(s) the Armed Forces." AI Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme Hassiba Hadi Sahraoui voiced grave concern over trials of civilians in military courts, stating <blockquote>Military trials for civilians are fundamentally unfair and it is time for the Egyptian authorities to end them. ... It is particularly worrying that a journalist seems to be facing an unfair trial by military court simply for carrying out his work. The charges against Mohamed Sabry must be dropped immediately.</blockquote>Sabry is believed to be the first civilian to face a military trial in the country since in the adoption of the new constitution. He could face up to a year in jail and a fine. AI stated in its report that more than 12,000 civilians were tried unfairly by military courts when the Egyptian army ruled the country from February 2011 to June 2012.

<p>Egypt's new constitution has been surrounded by controversy and criticized since it was drafted. After it was approved by referendum in December, a coalition of Egyptian rights group called for a redo, alleging <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-rights-groups-call-for-new-vote-on-constitution.php">widespread irregularities</a> [JURIST report] in voting procedures. Egyptian press and commentators were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20843535">divided over its approval</a> [BBC report], as some declared the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20842750">results to be "fake"</a> [BBC report]. Supporters of the document from the Muslim Brotherhood, however, claimed its approval was the valid choice of the people. It was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed into law</a> by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] weeks after its approval. Before it was approved, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] over its contents, noting that no women were involved in drafting the document and that their rights were "grossly under-represented." In November, AI also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">voiced concern</a> that the approved constitution contains language that "ignores the rights of women, restricts freedom of expression in the name of protecting religion, and allows for the military trial of civilians." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/stamped_collins_complaint_sm.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], filed by the ACLU and the <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/">ACLU of New Mexico</a> [advocacy website] in 2010, did not seek to challenge DADT, but an internal Department of Defense separation-pay policy that automatically cut in half veterans' separation pay solely on the basis of their sexual orientation. James Esseks, the litigation director for the ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender &#38; AIDS Project, said:<blockquote>I'm pleased to announce that the Obama Administration has just agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying all of the service members 100 percent of the separation pay they are owed. Coming on the heels of the repeal of DADT (for which the Administration deserves tremendous credit), this policy change is a wonderful (if overdue) recognition that these soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines deserve no less than all the others who served honorably and defended their country with their lives.</blockquote>The settlement will cover service members who served at least six years, and were discharged on or after November 10, 2004 under DADT.

<p>Gay rights remain a controversial issue throughout the US, particularly with respect to <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In December Wisconsin's 4th District Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/wisconsin-appeals-court-upholds-domestic-partnership-registry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's domestic partnership registry does not infringe on the Wisconsin constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Earlier that week the <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/montana-high-court-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-suit.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit seeking legal status for same-sex relationships. Montana, like Wisconsin, has a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Earlier that month Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. Washington had previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/washington-governor-signs-domestic.php">recognized domestic partnerships</a> [JURIST report]. Also in December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed to rule</a> [JURIST report] on two cases dealing with same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v.

Judge Emilie Elias of the <a href="http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org">Superior Court of Los Angeles</a> [official website] held that the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/01/names-catholic-church-sex-abuse-records-public-judge-ruling.html">public's right to know</a> [LAT report] how the archdiocese dealt with the molestation allegations outweighs any concern over the Catholic Church's possible embarrassment arising from the information's full disclosure, overruling a 2011 decision by the Superior Court. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-church-files-20121208,0,3376780.story">documents include</a> [LAT report] internal memos, Vatican correspondence, and psychiatric reports. 

<p>The California Superior Court's decision on Monday joins a growing trend regarding parochial legal proceedings in the US. In August ajudge for the US District Court for the District of Oregon ruled in favor of the Vatican by holding that priests are <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-rules-priests-not-vatican-employees-in-sex-abuse-case.php">not employees</a> [JURIST report] of the Holy See, the ecclesiastical, governmental and administrative capital of the Roman Catholic Church. Judge Michael Mosman ruled that the facts of the case do not establish an employer-employee relationship, despite his 2006 ruling <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/vatican-loses-bid-for-immunity-in.php">allowing the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] to proceed on a strictly legal theory that a priest was a Vatican employee under Oregon law. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> [Cornell LII materials] typically grants the Vatican and other foreign states immunity in US courts, but the 1976 act does not shield such states when engaged in commercial or certain harmful activities in the US. In June a 12-member jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304765304577482741702908490.html">handed down a landmark verdict</a> [WSJ report] finding Msgr. William Lynn, secretary for clergy in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1992 to 2004, guilty of child endangerment for allowing a priest to take a new assignment after learning of sexual abuse allegations against him. Msgr. Lynn is the first Roman Catholic Church official <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/us/philadelphia-church-official-to-be-sentenced-in-abuse-case.html?_r=0">to be convicted</a> [NYT report] of covering up sexual abuses by priests in the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Lama was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/nepal-army-officer-charged-in-uk-with-torture-during-2005-civil-war.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in the UK last week and is charged with two counts of torture during Nepal's civil war in 2005. The charges stem from two separate incidences that allegedly occurred between April and May 2005 at the Gorusinghe Army Barracks in Nepal. Sam Zarifi, ICJ's Asia Director, welcomed the arrest of Lama:<blockquote>The ICJ welcomes the steps taken by the UK to criminally investigate and bring to justice an individual suspected of the serious crime of torture. If the government wants to prevent the future prosecution of conflict-era human rights violations in foreign countries, then it must cooperate with the UK proceedings, and take immediate steps to investigate and prosecute similar violations domestically, in line with Nepal's own international obligations and the jurisprudence of Nepal's Supreme Court.</blockquote>Nepal's deputy prime minister, Narayankaji Shrestha, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jan/06/uk-defends-prosecute-nepalese-colonel">denounced</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the arrest and called for Lama's immediate release. However, as the ICJ pointed out, such a release would violate the UK's international obligations if a full investigation is not conducted first. 

<p>In October the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/NP/OHCHR_Nepal_Conflict_Report2012.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">urging justice for victims of international law violations</a> [JURIST report] that occurred during Nepal's civil war, a conflict which resulted in approximately <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">13,000 deaths</a> [JURIST report]. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch </a>(HRW) [official website] and the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/nepal-urged-not-to-impose-blanket-amnesty.php">urged Nepal to reject blanket amnesty</a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed during the countries civil war. In the same month, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-Wha Kang</a> [official profile], the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-urges-nepal-to-punish-war-crimes-increase-womens-rights.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Nepal for its reluctance to prosecute war crimes and for its lack of progress on women's rights. <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-nepal-peace.php">OHCHR</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/hrw-nepal-must-vigorously-investigate.php">HRW</a> [JURIST reports] have both appealed to the Nepalese government to investigate human rights violations committed during the civil war. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tahani el-Gebali is the only female judge to sit on the Constitutional Court, the country's highest court, and she was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/judge-challenges-egypts-constitution-18160902#.UOxCJLYarcE">removed from her post</a> [AP report] after nearly a decade of service because the new constitution reduced the size of the court from 18 judges to 10. El-Gebali argues that the independence of the court is violated by the forced reductions and also that provisions that allow the president to approve court members illegitimately deny that power to the court's general secretariat. In her complaint el-Gebali has asked the Constitutional Court to repeal all effects of the new constitution, not just the reduction in the size of the court.

Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [JURIST report] that water flowing through a concrete channel from different points in the river does not create a pollutant under the <A href = "http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cwa.cfm?program_id=45">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [materials]. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion. All of the parties in the case had asked for this result, but the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Santa Monica Baykeeper argued for a different reasoning. Ginsburg explained that was not within the court's narrow question.<blockquote>The NRDC and Baykeeper urge that the Court of Appeals reached the right result, albeit for the wrong reason. The monitoring system proposed by the District and written into its permit showed numerous instances in which water-quality standards were exceeded. Under the permit's terms, the NRDC and Baykeeper maintain, the exceedances detected at the instream monitoring stations are by themselves sufficient to establish the District's liability under the CWA for its upstream discharges. This argument failed below. It is not embraced within, or even touched by, the narrow question on which we granted <em>certiorari</em>. We therefore do not address, and indicate no opinion on, the issue the NRDC and Baykeeper seek to substitute for the question we took up for review.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito concurred only in the judgment but did not write an opinion.

<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Roderick Walston recently <A href = "/sidebar/2012/11/roderick-walston-stormwater-epa.php">considered the case</a> [JURIST comment]. "The Ninth Circuit's reasoning is troubling. Since the CWA prohibits the 'discharge' of pollutants into waterways from a 'point source,' the location of the point source that is the original source of the pollution is vital in determining the applicability of the CWA and whether a discharger has violated it. The CWA prohibits only the original discharge of pollutants into the waterways from a point source, and it does not prohibit another discharge of the same pollutants in the same waterway. As the Court held in an <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+South+Florida+Water+Management+District+v.+Miccosukee+Tribe&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=2885126139617306748&scilh=0">earlier case</a> [opinion], there has been no 'addition' of a pollutant to 'the waters of the US' within the meaning of the CWA unless the waters from which a pollutant has been conveyed are 'meaningfully distinct.' Since the character of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers are not different above and below the monitoring stations and the downstream outfalls, these segments of the river are not 'meaningfully distinct' within the meaning of the Court's decision in <span class = "casename">Miccosukee Tribe</span>, and there has been no 'addition; of a pollutant to 'the waters of the US' simply because the pollutants passed through these facilities.'"</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gonzales</a> [JURIST report] and <span class = "casename">Tibbals v. Carter</span> that there is no right to stay a federal <em>habeas corpus</em> proceeding until an inmate becomes competent. The court held, rather, that the proceeding can continue with only the attorney. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court.<blockquote>Both Gonzales and Carter argued at length in their  briefs and at oral argument that district courts have the  equitable power to stay proceedings when they determine that <em>habeas</em> petitioners are mentally incompetent. Neither petitioner disputes that "[d]istrict courts ... ordinarily have authority to issue stays, where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion." Similarly, both petitioners agree that "AEDPA does not deprive district courts of [this] authority." Petitioners and respondents disagree, however, about the types of situations in which a stay would be appropriate and about the permissible duration of a competency-based stay. We do not presume that district courts need unsolicited advice from us on how to manage their dockets. Rather, the decision to grant a stay, like the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing, is "generally left to the sound discretion of district courts." For purposes of resolving these cases, it is unnecessary to determine the precise contours of the district court&#8217;s discretion to issue stays. We address only its outer limits.</blockquote>The decision clarified the 1966 decision <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Rees+v.+Peyton&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=8299474264439944931&scilh=0">Rees v. Peyton</a> [opinion].

<p><span class = "casename">Rees</span> involved a convicted murderer who attempted to withdraw his petition for <em>certiorari</em> from the Supreme Court, which his attorney, in good conscience, could not do. A psychiatrist then declared Rees mentally incompetent. The court retained jurisdiction by a <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Rees_v_Peyton_386_US_989_87_S_Ct_1310_18_L_Ed_2d_333_1967_Court_O">stay</a> [order text] until the federal district court could make a report on Melvin Rees' competency. Rees died in prison in 1995.

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1274.pdf">Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on the statute of limitations under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2462">28 USC &#167; 2462</a> [text] and whether it begins tolling when the government can first bring an action against a penalty. The attorney for the Gabelli Global Growth Fund (GGGF) argued that since the SEC is not attempting to recoup for a victim, the government should be forced to acknowledge the violation when it occurs. "[I]t doesn't concern a common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where there's even any element of deception that's required. It's a breach of fiduciary duty. What the [International Assets Advisory] says is that the government can sue when the violation occurs." The SEC argued the contrary, although the Justices were incredulous that there had never been a case where the government had exceed the 5-year limitation in 28 USC &#167; 2462. Justice Stephen Breyer asked for examples. "And until 2004 I haven't found a single case in which the government ever tried to assert the discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they are a victim, with one exception, a case called <span class = "casename">Maillard</span> in the 19th century where they did make that assertion. They were struck down by the district court, and the attorney general in his opinion said: The district court's absolutely right; of course, the government cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations where what they're trying to do is to gather something that's so close to a criminal case. [...] I'd say for 200 years there is no case. The only case, as far as I have been able to discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the government to assert a civil penalty. That's what created the problem. Before that there was no problem; it was clear the government couldn't do it."

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-98.pdf">Delia v. EMA</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether <a href = "http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_108A/GS_108A-57.html">NC Gen. Stat. &#167; 108A-57</a> is preempted by the Medicaid Act's anti-lien provision, <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">42 USC &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)</a>(25), 1396k(a) [texts], as it was understood in <A href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Arkansas_Dept_of_Health__Human_Servs_v_Ahlborn_547_US_268_126_S_C">Arkansas Department of Health &#38; Human Services v. Ahlborn</a> [opinion text]. States have a right to recover Medicaid benefits. The North Carolina statute automatically takes a one-third interest in any settlement or judgment from a tort as reimbursement, unless that would exceed one-third of what a person has received in Medicaid benefits. However, one-third of minor EMA's tort recovery is much greater than the Medicaid funds she has used. An attorney for the <a href = "http://www.ncdhhs.gov/">Department of Heath and Human Services for North Carolina</a> [official website] argued that the statute gives the state a right to tort proceeds before the plaintiff has them, thus overriding a jury verdict or stipulation between parties. The attorney for EMA argued that since the statute ignores the facts of an individual case by applying a set proportion to a settlement, it violates <span class = "casename">Ahlborn</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Seven inmates at two Italian prisons filed complaints against the Italian government in 2009, alleging that the prison cells were overcrowded and that there was inadequate lighting and a lack of hot water. The court ruled that the conditions violated Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], amounting to <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-4212710-5000451#{%22itemid%22:[%22003-4212710-5000451%22]}">"inhuman and degrading treatment"</a> [press release]. The court imposed a fine of &#8364;100,000 against the Italian government and ordered the government to remedy the overcrowding issues within one year. 

<p>Prison overcrowding is a common problem across the globe. In August the Colombia Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/colombia-transfers-inmates-to-solve-prison-overcrowding-problem.php">announced a new initiative</a> [JURIST report] to solve the problem of overcrowding in the nation's prisons. In June UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/DeputyHighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-official-urges-malawi-to-improve-human-rights-conditions-accountability.php">urged the government of Malawi</a> [JURIST report] to address the problem of prison overcrowding and improve the human rights condition in the country. That month Burundi announced that it would also <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/burundi-releases-prisoners-to-address-overcrowded-prisons.php">release prisoners to solve overcrowding problems</a> [JURIST report]. In April South Africa announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/south-africa-president-pardons-35000-offenders-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">issue pardons</a> [JURIST report] to 35,000 offenders in order to ease prison overcrowding. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/hrw-calls-for-reduction-of-latin-america-prison-population.php">called for the reduction of overcrowding</a> [JURIST report] to improve poor prison conditions in Latin America following a prison fire in Honduras, which killed more than 300 inmates and injured dozens more. In August 2011, Venezuela announced its <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/venezuela-to-release-40-percent-of-prisoners-to-reduce-overcrowding.php">plan to reduce its prison population</a> [JURIST report] by 40 percent. A controversial clemency law introduced in Italy that reduced some prison sentences by three years to cut down on jail overcrowding <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/new-italy-law-cutting-prison-time.php">faced criticism</a> [JURIST report] in August 2006 after some released prisoners returned to lives of crime. Prisons in the US are facing similar problems. In May 2011 the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v.

The detainees filed suit against two military defense contractors in federal court in 2008 for alleged torture occurring over a period of four years. The cases against <a href="http://www.caci.com/">CACI International Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/">L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.</a> [corporate websites] were <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-torture-cases-against-abu-ghraib-contractors.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in September 2011 on the grounds that the companies have immunity as government contractors.

<p>A three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-torture-cases-against-abu-ghraib-contractors.php">dismissed the claims</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/091335.P.pdf">CACI International Inc.</a> and <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/101891.P.pdf">L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.</a> [opinions, PDF] in September 2011, holding that federal law protecting civilian contractors acting under the control of the US military in a combat situation preempted the plaintiffs' tort claims based in state law. US military personnel have also been accused of torturing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=graner">Army Spc.

Applicants would have to pay $30, and the licenses would last for three years and could not be used for the purchase of firearms, to vote or to board a plane. The bill has received bipartisan support, although opponents argued that it could increase identity fraud. Proponents of the bill advocated it as a <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/illinois-house-oks-illegal-immigrant-driver-s-licenses-bill/article_6dcad193-ad16-5dff-bb4e-f11b321546bd.html">public safety measure</a> [AP report] that would allow potential licensees to take both written and driving tests and would require the immigrants to have proof of auto insurance. Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] <a href="http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=10854">welcomed the legislation</a> [statement]:<blockquote>More than 250,000 immigrant motorists on our roads today have not passed a driving test, which presents a dangerous risk to other drivers. Illinois roads will be safer if we ensure every driver learns the rules of the road and is trained to drive safely. Not only will Senate Bill 957 save lives, it will save Illinois motorists $46 million a year in insurance premiums by making sure every driver is properly insured.</blockquote>The Illinois Senate approved the bill last December. Quinn stated that he looks forward to signing the bill.

<p>In October California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/-or-illegalimmigrants-or-immigration.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/asm/ab_2151-2200/ab_2189_bill_20120824_amended_sen_v93.pdf">similar bill</a> [AB 2189, PDF] that will allow some immigrants who came to the US as children to obtain state driver's licenses if they qualify for a new federal work permit program. In essence, the law directed California's Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to people who do not have a social security number but can prove they are authorized to be in the US under federal law. In contrast, Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] recently issued an <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/arizona-governor-issues-executive-order-denying-benefits-to-undocumented-immigrants.php">executive order</a> [JURIST report] that instructs state agencies not to provide driver's licenses and other public benefits to undocumented immigrants who have gained the right to work under the new federal program. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has filed a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/aclu-sues-arizona-governor-for-denying-drivers-licenses-to-illegal-immigrants.php">challenging the order</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Army Colonel Denise Lind, who is overseeing the pre-trial hearing, determined that the extended solitary confinement and suicide restraints used on Manning during his detention at a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va. were "more rigorous than necessary" and that any sentence levied upon Manning will be <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/gis-hearing-wikileaks-case-focuses-motive">reduced by 112 days</a> [AP report] to reflect the abuses of his detention. Lind ruled that though the punishment was illegal it did not warrant having the charges against him thrown out of court. During his detention Manning was kept alone in a windowless cell for 23 hours per day and that was bound within a "suicide smock" to restrict his physical movement. Lawyers for the government had conceded that Manning had been held seven days too long in suicide watch status and recommended that any sentence be mitigated by seven days to reflect that abuse. Thus far Manning has spent 959 days in pretrial detention.

<p>Manning's case has engendered a great deal of controversy. In November the judge overseeing the case <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> a partial guilty plea <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case-offers-guilty-plea.php">offered by Manning</a> [JURIST reports] earlier in the month. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave argued that the <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">lack of transparency</a> [JURIST comment] in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June Lind ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">withheld from the defense during discovery</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in June Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss eight of the 22 charges against Manning after his defense had argued they were unconstitutionally vague. In May UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez accused the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-the-un-special-rapporteur.php">cruel and inhuman treatment</a> [JURIST report] of Manning. The US military court referred Manning's <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-refers-intelligence-analyst%27s-wikileaks-case-for-court-martial.php">case for court-martial</a> in February after a US Army panel of experts declared Manning <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST reports] last April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants are associated with <a href="http://www.viettan.org/-English-.html">Viet Tan</a> [advocacy website], a dissident group that Vietnam's government deems terrorists, although the US government has reported no evidence of terrorism. The trial <a href="http://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/wire/asia/vietnam-finds-activists-guilty-of-subversion/article_33d71ccb-7e92-520e-92ff-454e11fdc66d.html">lasted for two days</a> [AP report] and culminated in the activists being found guilty of attending Viet Tan's training courses on nonviolent struggle and computer and Internet security, and some also of protesting against China's claims to territory in the South China Sea. The <a href="http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/index.html">US Embassy in Hanoi</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr10913i.html">statement</a> [text] about the verdicts, saying that the convictions "are part of a disturbing human rights trend [and] appears to be inconsistent with Vietnam's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to freedom of expression and due process." The embassy called on for the immediate release of the defendants and other prisoners of conscience.

<p>In September a court in Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/vietnam-court-jails-bloggers-for-anti-state-propaganda.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] bloggers Nguyen Van Hai, alias Dieu Cay, Phan Thanh Hai, alias Anhbasg, and Ta Phong Tan jailed for anti-state propaganda on charges of spreading propaganda to defame the Vietnamese government, in violation of <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/38/26/46817423.pdf">Article 88 of the Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF]. Blogger Nguyen Van Hai was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and Ta Phong Tan was sentenced to 10 years. Phan Thanh Hai pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] have called for the writers' release, calling the charges "<a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20061">politically-motivated</a>" [AI report]. In 2011 a Vietnamese appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/vietnam-appeals-court-reduces-sentence-of-pro-democracy-blogger.php">reduced the sentence</a> [JURIST report] of pro-democracy blogger and professor <a href="http://pkquoc.multiply.com/journal/item/5/5">Pham Minh Hoang</a> [blog, in Vietnamese], who had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-court-sentences-blogger-to-3-years-for-subversion.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to three years in prison after writing anti-government articles on his blog under his pen name.

US</span> that it is defendants' burden to prove they had removed themselves from a conspiracy in cases where their departure from the conspiracy happened long enough ago that prosecution would be barred by a statute of limitations. Lawyers for the appellant argued that though their client had been involved in a criminal conspiracy, it should be incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the defendant had remained active in the conspiracy past the time threshold determined by the state's statute of limitations. Delivering the opinion for the unanimous court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:<blockquote>Having joined forces to achieve collectively more evil than he could accomplish alone, Smith tied his fate to that of the group. His individual change of heart (assuming it occurred) could not put the conspiracy genie back in the bottle. We punish him for the havoc wreaked by the unlawful scheme, whether or not he remained actively involved. It is his withdrawal that must be active, and it was his burden to show that.</blockquote>The court affirmed the <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/06/18/raynor.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that once the prosecution had proven that the defendants were a part of the conspiracy, the defendants must positively establish that they actively left the conspiracy prior to the date imposed by the statute of limitations.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-criminal-procedure-issues.php">heard oral arguments</a> in this case in November after <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-conspiracy-case.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in June. The case involved two individuals who had been sentenced to life in prison for their connections to a large drug ring that has been tied to several murders. The government alleged that the two were members of the drug ring and involved in an ongoing conspiracy to commit a number of crimes with the group. At issue is a jury instruction that allowed jurors to assume that the defendants did not abandon the conspiracy unless the defendants positively demonstrated that this was the case. The jurors convicted the defendants based on the fact that they had been members of the group during a time that was barred by statute of limitations. Because the defendants did not offer sufficient evidence to refute their ongoing participation in the conspiracy, their ongoing participation leading up to the permitted statutory period was assumed. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report details the ways in which domestic workers are more vulnerable than other workers and what that means for the domestic worker population. More than 52 million people world wide are domestic workers, and only 10 percent of that population is afforded the same protections as other workers. Some are even completely excluded from normal protections such as minimum wages, limitation on working hours and maternity protections. The report claims that "29.9 per cent, or some 15.7 million domestic workers - work in countries where they are completely excluded from the scope of national labour legislation." Further, the report summarizes the challenges faced by domestic works well in saying:<blockquote>Very low wages, excessively long hours, the absence of a weekly rest day, risks of physical, mental and sexual abuse and restrictions on freedom of movement are some of the problems that have frequently characterized the working conditions of domestic workers worldwide. These can partly be attributed to gaps in national labour and employment legislation and often reflect discrimination along the lines of sex, race and caste.</blockquote>The population of domestic workers is growing and largely made up of female workers. To address these challenges, the ILO stressed the need to implement the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C189">The Domestic Workers Convention</a> [text] and its recommendations to provide a framework for improvement.

<p>Rights of domestic workers has been a controversial issue for years. Last September the Domestic Workers Convention was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-domestic-worker-rights-treaty-to-take-effect-next-year.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] by enough countries to qualify to go into force in September 2013. In October 2011 the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-expert-warns-of-potential-lebanon-slavery.php">UN warned Lebanon</a> [JURIST report] specifically that it needed to create more laws to protect rights of domestic workers. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hrw-urges-lebanon-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">expressed the same opinion</a> [JURIST report], stating that Lebanon needed to do more to protect domestic workers in its country and prosecute those who violate their rights. HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/domestic-workers-facing-abusive.php">released a statement</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 saying that migrant and domestic workers were facing human rights abuses throughout the Middle East and Asia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Judge Shira Scheindlin opined that the method, said to be a crime deterrent by the NYPD, violates the protection against unreasonable search and seizures of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">Fourth Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">backgrounder</a>] because officers were not first developing a reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk supposed trespassers. The evidence, she said, "strengthens the conclusion that the NYPD's inaccurate training has taught officers the following lesson: Stop and question first, develop reasonable suspicion later." The policy developed as part of the city's <a href="http://manhattanda.org/trespass-affidavit-program">Trespass Affidavit Program</a> (TAP) [Manhattan District Attorney backgrounder], which allows property managers in the program to ask officers to patrol their buildings and arrest trespassers as a means of combating drug dealing in the public areas of such buildings. Despite TAP's intent, Scheindlin ordered police to "cease performing trespass stops" outside the private buildings, "even if the building is located in a high-crime area, and regardless of the time of day," unless officers had already developed a reasonable suspicion to investigate. The next proceeding in the case is scheduled for January 31.

<p>Scheindlin's decision is the first federal ruling to find that the "stop-and-frisk" practice is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, though the NYPD has recently received a great deal of scrutiny for various allegations of misconduct. In July a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">NYPD used excessive force and violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. Specifically, the report alleged that police frequently used excessive force against protesters indiscriminately, sometimes for no apparent reason. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. JURIST guest columnist Samar Warsi in May <a href="/hotline/2012/05/samar-warsi-muslim-surveillance.php">questioned the NYPD policies</a> [JURIST comment] stating: "It is vital to be cautious when government officials use glittering generalities such as 'national security' and 'counterterrorism' to legitimize acts and policies in clear contravention of basic constitutional guarantees." In May, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution.  In March, NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly fervently <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">denied</a> [speech; <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_18_ny_times_is_wrong.shtml">press release</a>] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

McNeely</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-reverses-west-virginia-redistricting-ruling.php">report</a>] on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] allows a police officer to take a warrantless blood sample to test for alcohol levels. The Missouri Supreme Court <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/State_v_McNeely_358_SW3d_65_Mo_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion text] that the exigency standard set in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/757/case.html">Schmerber v. California</a> [opinion text] for warrantless intrusions of the body, "requires more than the mere dissipation of blood-alcohol evidence." John Koester, appearing on behalf of Missouri, argued that securing evidence quickly was paramount to a drunk driving investigation because alcohol is continuously removed from the blood by the body and thus securing a warrant to obtain a blood sample would be overly burdensome. The court questioned why a blood sample was necessary when a breathalyzer would provide adequate results. Koester argued that the warrantless search was reasonable, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the reasonableness of the search given how intrusive it was. The justices also pointed out that many jurisdictions have implemented a streamlined process where it only takes officers 15 to 20 minutes to obtain a warrant in drunk driving cases, whereas Koester had stated that in this case it would have taken the officer 90 to 120 minutes to obtain a warrant. Sotomayor suggested that it would be improper for the court to reward police in inefficient jurisdictions when other jurisdictions had demonstrated that they could obtain warrants adequately. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed the court's reluctance with giving police the ability to obtain blood samples without a warrant: "it's a pretty scary image of somebody restrained, and ... a representative of the State approaching them with a needle."

<p>The second case heard by the court on Wednesday was <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-25.pdf">Maracich v. Spears</a> [transcript, PDF]. This case raised the question of whether lawyers can use personal information from driver's licenses to obtain clients and if they can delay a lawsuit until they have obtained these clients. The lawyers in the case used South Carolina's Freedom of Information Act to obtain driver information from South Carolina's Department of Motor Vehicles. This aided them in creating a client list to bring several group action suits against car dealerships. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/State_v_McNeely_358_SW3d_65_Mo_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion text] that the lawyers did not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2721">Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994</a> (DPPA) [text]. The DPPA generally prohibits the state department of motor vehicles from distributing drivers' personal information, but includes several exceptions, including the "solicitation" and "litigation" exceptions. The "solicitation" exception requires the express consent of drivers, whereas the "litigation" exception does not. Joseph Guerra, appearing for the petitioners, argued that the opposing lawyers were undertaking a solicitation of individuals as potential clients for their own commercial purpose and were not using the information in connection with litigation. Guerra further argued that the primary purpose of the DPPA was to prevent such solicitations, thus all of the exceptions must be read in light of that primary purpose. Justice Elena Kagan appeared skeptical of why all 14 exceptions had to be read in light of the exception which was number 12 on the list. Kagan further questioned why the court should not just read the exceptions as individual parts of a list. Guerra argued that soliciting clients to join a class action lawsuit which had already begun was not "in connection with ... investigation in anticipation of litigation" because in that case the lawyers are acting for their own commercial benefit, not as officers of the court. Several justices questioned that reasoning and repeatedly asked where the basis in the statute was to distinguish between lawyers as commercial actors and lawyers as officers of the court. Paul Clement, appearing for the respondents, argued that the "litigation" exception was extremely broad, authorizing any use of driver information "covering the litigation process from cradle to grave." Roberts stated that the "in connection with ... litigation" language must have some limit, otherwise everything would be covered. Clement responded that it is clear from the litigation history that Congress intended this provision to be broad and that his clients fell within the unconditional "litigation" exception.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The claim alleges that Microsoft <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-motorola-drops-key-patent-claims-against-microsoft-20130109,0,726982.story">infringed</a> [Reuters report] on Motorola Mobility's patents related to technology used in the Xbox. The withdrawal of the claim is required in an agreement Google made with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website] last week.

Nike, Inc.</span> that Nike's covenant not to enforce a trademark against Already's existing products and any future "colorable imitations" moots Already's action to have the trademark declared invalid. In this case, the court considered whether Nike's promise not to sue was broad enough to assure that it would not assert a future claim against Already if it infringed on the same trademark in a different way, and whether Nike had the ability to avoid an attack on its trademark validity by making a promise like this. Delivering the opinion for the unanimous court, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote:<blockquote>Once Nike demonstrated that the covenant encompasses all of Already's allegedly unlawful conduct, it became incumbent on Already to indicate that it engages in or has sufficiently concrete plans to engage in activities that would arguably infringe Nike's trademark yet not be covered by the covenant. But Already failed to do so in the courts below or in this Court. The case is thus moot because the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to recur.</blockquote>Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Overall, the court affirmed the <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Nike_Inc_v_Already_LLC_663_F3d_89_100_USPQ2d_1621_2d_Cir_2011_Cou">ruling</a> [opinion] of the <a href="www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] that Nike's delivery of a covenant not to sue eliminated a justiciable case or controversy in a trademark action where Already asserted counterclaims for a declaratory judgment of invalidity and noninfringement of Nike's trademark for the "Air Force One" athletic shoe. In essence, the court found that Nike's covenant not to sue Already was unconditional and irrevocable.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-trademarks-attorneys-fees.php">heard oral arguments</a> in this case in November after <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">granting certiorari</a> [JURIST reports] in June. The case examined the issue of whether a federal court has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] jurisdiction over a party's challenge to the validity of a trademark if the owner of the trademark has agreed not to sue the party over alleged infringement. The dispute arose when Nike alleged that several shoes manufactured by Already has infringed upon patented techniques of Nike's "Air Force One" sneaker. When Already filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nike's patent, Nike petitioned the court to dismiss its suit against Already as well as Already's counterclaim. Nike then issued a promise to Already that it would not pursue any further action because, as Nike's lawyer explained to the Supreme Court, "Nike concluded that [Already's] activities were no longer significant enough to warrant the cost of litigation." Already still wished to pursue its claim challenging Nike's patent, but Nike argued that since it vowed not to pursue litigation, there was no longer any "case or controversy" as required under Article III of the US Constitution. The district court agreed with Nike, and its decision was subsequently affirmed by the Second Circuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorney General Bill Schuette argued against the policy, claiming that, by extending the policy to provide health benefits for those who have "jointly shared the same regular and permanent residence" with a state employee, the MCSC is attempting to "circumvent Michigan's prohibition against recognizing any 'agreement' other than 'the union of one man and one woman in marriage.'" In a 2-1 opinion, Judges Amy Ronayne Krause and Stephen Borrello declared that "the policy is unambiguously gender-neutral," stating further that the policy "does not depend on the employee being in a close relationship of any particular kind ... beyond a common residence." Judge Michael Riordan dissented on the claims that there was no rational basis for the policy.

<p>The issue of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex relationships</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains controversial throughout the US, with states taking various approaches. In December Wisconsin's 4th District Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/wisconsin-appeals-court-upholds-domestic-partnership-registry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's domestic partnership registry does not infringe on the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Earlier in December the <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/montana-high-court-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-suit.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit seeking legal status for same-sex relationships. Like Wisconsin, Montana also has a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Earlier this month Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. Washington had previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/washington-governor-signs-domestic.php">recognized domestic partnerships</a> [JURIST report]. Also in December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed to rule</a> [JURIST report] on two cases dealing with same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket] the court will consider the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket] the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Martins hopes to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/09/3175126/war-court-prosecutor-to-abandon.html">drop the charges</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] in order to streamline the prosecution and ensure it is not delayed by an appeal on a potential conspiracy conviction. The five involved in the capital trial will still face seven other counts of war crimes, including terrorism and hijacking. There has yet to be an official decision from the Pentagon. The next hearing is scheduled for January 28. 

<p>Controversy continues to surround the Guantanamo military trials. Last month a federal judge affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-affirms-denial-of-habeas-petition-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">denial of a <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [JURIST report] for a Guantanamo detainee.

The <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ma/buffer-zone-law-info-for-patients-18525.htm">buffer zone</a> [Planned Parenthood backgrounder] creates a protected area outside of the abortion clinic where people are not allowed to protest. This is meant to ensure potential patients safe passage into the facilities. The law creates a 35-foot buffer zone on the driveways and entrances to the facilities. Judge Bruce Selya held in his opinion that, "The Massachusetts statute at issue here is a content-neutral, narrowly tailored time-place-manner regulation that protects the rights of prospective patients and clinic employees without offending the First Amendment rights of others." The challengers of the law have stated they plan on appealing the decision. 

<p>The First Circuit previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/first-circuit-upholds-law-requiring.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.

The ordinance created a "buffer zone," preventing protesters from coming within 15 feet of the entrance of a medical facility, and also a "bubble zone," which prevented protesters from coming closer than eight feet to individuals within a 100 foot radius around a facility. The court held that either of the zones created by the ordinance would be proper by themselves, but in combination they were not sufficiently narrowly tailored</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ on Wednesday filed a <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Government-Supplemental-Brief-Al-Bahlul.pdf">supplemental brief</a> [text, PDF] arguing that the rationale in <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Hamdan-D.C.-Circuit.pdf">Hamden v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF], that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] does not "authorize retroactive prosecution of crimes that were not prohibited as war crimes triable by military commission under US law at the time the conduct occurred," is ultimately incorrect, but that the court is bound by the decision and must reverse Al Bahlul's conviction because his alleged actions predate the MCA. Wrote the DOJ:<blockquote>The conclusion of the [Hamdan v. United States] panel that Congress did not intend to authorize military commissions to try and punish pre-2006 conduct unless it constituted a clearly-recognized violation of international law cannot be squared with the plain language of the 2006 MCA and Congress's stated purpose in enacting it.</blockquote>Hamdan, like Bahlul, was charged with providing material support for terrorism, but succeeded with the DC Circuit because not only did his alleged conduct pre-date the MCA, but it was also determined that such action did not qualify as a war crime under international law. There, the government also acknowledged that conspiracy and solicitation, the two other crimes with which Al Bahul is charged, also do not qualify as international war crimes, thus bolstering the DOJ's case for reversal. 

<p>In September 2011 the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/">US Court of Military Commission Review</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/military-court-upholds-sentence-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled in a 7-0 vote</a> that Al Bahlul had been properly convicted of being a propagandist and should spend the rest of his <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-sentences-yemeni.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. He previously boycotted much of his trial proceedings. Al Bahlul, a 39-year old Yemeni citizen, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/second-guantanamo-detainee-goes-on.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2008. He is alleged to have been Osama bin Laden's personal assistant and media secretary and was charged in February 2008 with conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and attacks on civilians, and providing material support for terrorism. He is accused of researching the financial impact of the 9/11 attacks and also releasing the "martyr wills" of 9/11 hijackers Muhammed Atta and Ziad al Jarrah as propaganda videos. Al Bahlul was the second detainee to go on trial at Guantanamo since the prison there opened in 2002 and is the only convicted criminal currently held at the facility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the ACLU, the <a href="http://www.dnhpe.org/thenhbill">Education Tax Credit Bill</a> [text], which was passed last year and took effect on January 1, allows "businesses to reduce their tax liability by receiving an 85 percent tax credit in exchange for donations made to K-12 scholarship organizations, which will pay for tuition at religious and other private schools." Both the ACLU and AU are arguing that, because the bill does not provide for any monitoring or oversight of the funds, religious schools "will be able to use the donations for religious instruction, indoctrination and religiously based discrimination."

<p>The separation of church and state has been and remains a <a href="/dateline/2012/02/edward-sanfilippo-first-amendment.php">controversial issue</a> [JURIST op-ed] in American courts. In October the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-pennsylvania-year-of-the-bible-resolution.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a Pennsylvania House Resolution declaring 2012 the "Year of the Bible." In May the <a href="www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-appeals-court-allows-suit-opposing-ten-commandments-monument-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit opposing a Ten Commandments monument displayed on property owned by the City of Fargo, North Dakota, may move forward. Last January the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-county-board-meeting-prayers.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a case concerning whether a county board of commissioners in North Carolina violated the Establishment Clause by opening its public meetings with prayers. The court's denial of <em>certiorari</em> preserved a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-county-board-meeting-prayers-violated-first-amendment.php">holding</a> [JURIST report] that that the board of commissioners violated the Establishment Clause by effectively using a public forum to endorse Christianity. Earlier that month a federal judge ordered Florida's Dixie County Courthouse to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-rules-florida-courthouse-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">remove the Ten Commandments monument</a> [JURIST report] displayed on the front steps of the courthouse, concluding that the monument's religious message would be interpreted to be espoused by the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wali Mohammed Morafa, who has been detained for financially aiding the operations of terrorist organizations, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], requested for some top secret documentations concerning source-related information which the government refused to disclose. Instead the government offered an alternate secret version without substitutes for some source information. Morafa's lawyers have clearance for only secret but not top secret information. Relying on the discretion given to the lower courts by the 2008 US Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/553/06-1195/opinion.html">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion], Judge Rosemary Collyer held that "Top Secret source information is not reasonably available to those with Secret clearances." She acknowledged the burden on Morafa's lawyers that may result from her ruling but she stated that the value of the requested information is merely minimal allowing the lawyers to present their case without such. Moreover, because source-related information is highly sensitive and Morafa has access to edited versions of the substance deriving from such, there is a stronger interest in protecting national security by keeping the identity of the sources confidential.

<p>Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-signs-defense-spending-bill-despite-guantanamo-restrictions.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr4310enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr4310enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act of 2013</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF] which expressly prohibits using funds to transfer individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and also prohibits using funds to construct facilities in the US intended to house Guantanamo detainees. During his second day in office, Obama issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing the prison to be closed. However, in the face of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-house-rejects-domestic-transfer-of.php">congressional opposition</a> [JURIST report], the Obama administration missed its self-imposed deadline to close the military prison and, following the 2010 mid-term election, Congress <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php#closure">effectively halted</a> [JURIST backgrounder] plans to close the facility. The signing of the NDAA will further hinder Obama's ability to close Guantanamo Bay, despite a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/government-report-guantanamo-detainees-could-be-safely-absorbed-by-us-prisons.php">November report</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/index.html">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) [official website] that Guantanamo detainees could be safely absorbed by prisons throughout the US. Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz argues that Obama <a href="/forum/2011/04/failing-to-close-guantanamo.php">bears responsibility</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the political missteps that prevented Guantanamo from closing and criticizes him for embracing the "larger detention system that Guantanamo embodies." Conversely, Forum contributor David Frakt agrees that the Obama administration is partially responsible, but believes <a href="/forum/2012/09/david-frakt-guantanamo-detainees.php">lCongress is argely to blame</a> [JURIST op-ed] for passing a "series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the report, HRW stated that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, failed to take the necessary steps to ensure a "credible, free and fair elections" that will take place in March this year. HRW found that reforms have taken place for the legal and administrative requirements for successful elections but not on the implementation and enforcement of such agreements. Without effective enforcement mechanisms which are essential to credible, free and fair elections, HRW said it is most likely that the 2013 elections will fail. To avoid such a result, HRW called for several initiatives. For example, the Zimbabwe government should abolish all repressive legislation such as the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Public Order and Security Act, and the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. Another step for the government is to ensure that those responsible for the 2008 electoral violence are held accountable for their actions. Moreover, partisan heads of the police and other security forces should also be replaced by non-partisan individuals. HRW also called the international community to support Zimbabwe in successfully implementing the necessary reforms needed for peaceful and successful elections.

<p>Zimbabwe has been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. In November the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/+-Defenseurs-des-droits-humains-+?lang=en">Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders</a> (OBS) [FIDH backgrounder] released a report finding that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/zimbabwe-rights-defenders-facing-harassment-report.php">human rights defenders in Zimbabwe continue to be harassed</a> [JURIST report]. In March various human rights groups urged South African courts to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-urges-south-africa-to-prosecute-zimbabwe-crimes-against-humanity.php">prosecute</a> Zimbabwe for <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">violations including torture and forced labor</a> [JURIST reports] of civilian workers in illegal mining camps. In June 2009 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/zimbabwe-amnesty-international-secretary-general-concludes-visit-2009061">report</a> [press release] stating that Zimbabwe was still experiencing serious <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/zimbabwe-government-urged-to-address.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], such as the arrest and detention of human rights activists, and needed to confront issues that led to such problems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rogers suggested the impact of releasing the photos could bring "worse" consequences than the release secret American intelligence offices abroad.

<p>Concerns about the nature of bin Laden's death and his subsequent burial at sea have arisen since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">announcement of his death</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011, while US officials have maintained that their actions were lawful. US State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/state-department-legal-adviser-defends-legality-of-bin-laden-killing.php">defended the killing</a> [JURIST report] saying it was "consistent with the laws of armed conflict and US military doctrine." Days after the killing, human rights experts from the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-special-rapporteurs-on-executions-want-full-statement-of-facts-on-bin-laden-killing.php">called on the US to disclose further details</a> [JURIST report] of the killing, in order "to allow an assessment in terms of international human rights law standards." UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-full-disclosure-on-bin-laden-killing.php">insisted</a> [JURIST report] on "a full disclosure of the accurate facts" surrounding the killing of Bin Laden after the White House altered the official account of the killing from its original announcement. US Attorney General Eric Holder told the US Senate Judiciary Committee that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/holder-bin-laden-killing-lawful.php">killing of Bin Laden was lawful and justified</a> [JURIST report], testifying that the shooting of Bin Laden was "consistent with our values," and that the soldiers who killed him "conducted themselves totally appropriately."</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, Russia will continue to honor the validity of the "existing bilateral adoption agreement between Russia and the United States." Putin <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">signed the ban</a> [JURIST report] in late December. The Russian adoption law is known as the Yakovlev initiative, after US-adopted Russian toddler Dima Yakolev, who died in Virginia in 2008. The spokesperson did not directly discuss the status of the 46 adoptions that were in process when the law was scheduled to take effect.

<p>The <a href="http://rapsinews.com/">Russian Legal Information Agency</a> (RAPSI) [official website], a legal information agency which operates in coordination with Russian courts, reports the Yakovlev initiative was <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121221/265867961.html">adopted in retaliation</a> [RAPSI report] against the US <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text].

Magnitsky <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption,%20torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php ">died in prison in 2009</a> [JURIST report].

Neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Kuessel was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/austrian-court-finds-guilty-glorifying-nazism-18184572">sentenced</a> [AP report] to nine years in prison for creating the Alpen-Donau website, which promotes Nazism. Kuessel spent time in prison during the 1990s for his attempt to create a new type of Nazi party. The Austrian court gave Kuessel's two accomplices, Felix Binder and Wilhelm Anderl, a lesser sentence. Binder will spend seven years and prison while Anderl faces four-and-a-half years in. Although the website is no longer active, Austria spent a long time trying to shut down the website because it was launched through a US server. Due to US free speech laws, Austria encountered obstruction when it tried to shut down the website. In Austria it is against the law to glorify Nazism.

<p>Germany recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened investigations</a> [JURIST report] and began prosecuting Nazis for war crimes. In November German prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-nazi-for-1944-killing.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 91-year-old former member of the Nazi <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007405">Waffen SS</a> [USHMM backgrounder] Siert Bruins with the murder of a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944. The Dortmund prosecutor accused Bruins of executing captured Dutch Nazi-opposition fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 outside the town of Appingedam. Bruins and an accomplice, who since died, were accused of taking Dijkema, a prisoner at the time, to an isolated location and then shooting him four times. The suspects reported at the time that Dijkema had been trying to escape when they shot him. Bruins already served time in the 1980s for the murders of two Dutch Jews during the war. In March John Demjanjuk, a former guard at a Nazi death camp who had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted</a> in Germany of helping to murder thousands during the Holocaust, <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/convicted-nazi-guard-demjanjuk-dies-at-91.php">died while awaiting his appeal</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF] ruled in December that the concealed carry ban unconstitutionally infringed on the right to bear arms for self-defense. On Tuesday Madigan filed a petition for re-hearing <em>en banc</em>, which is a request for all 10 judges on the Seventh Circuit to hear the case. Madigan explained that she is seeking a rehearing because she believes the Seventh Circuit ruled too broadly in its December decision, and that the decision conflicts with rulings by two other federal appeals courts: <blockquote>In ruling that Illinois must allow individuals to carry ready-to-use firearms in public, the 7th Circuit Court's decision goes beyond what the US Supreme Court has held and conflicts with decisions by two other federal appellate courts. Based on those decisions, it is appropriate to ask the full 7th Circuit to review this case and consider adopting an approach that is consistent with the other appellate courts that have addressed these issues after the US Supreme Court's landmark Heller and McDonald decisions.</blockquote>It is unclear when the Seventh Circuit will decide whether to rehear the case.

<p>Illinois lawmakers, particularly those in Chicago, have struggled to limit firearm possession and advance <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] initiatives in the city without violating the Constitution. In June the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-chicago-gun-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of the <a href="http://www.isp.state.il.us/docs/ordinances/chicago.pdf">Chicago Firearms Ordinance</a> [text, PDF] that prevents firearm purchase by individuals who have "been convicted by a court in any jurisdiction of ... unlawful use of a weapon that is a firearm" because such a standard is unconstitutionally vague. The Ordinance was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Chicago City Council in July 2010, and imposes strict regulations on firearm possession. In particular, residents who possess firearms are required to keep them inside their homes, and are not permitted to take their guns into the yard, garage or porch of the home. The legislation was enacted four days after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">ruled in McDonald v. Chicago</a> [JURIST report] that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is applicable to the states as well as the federal government. The decision effectively struck down Chicago's former handgun ban, as it prohibited citizens from keeping handguns in their homes under any circumstances. </p>]]></content:encoded>

After seizing the victims from their homes, Kuvjela assisted members of his police unit in their transport to a warehouse collection point known as "the White House" where they were detained and subjected to physical abuse. The following day, Kuvjela then helped to separate the victims by sex, whereupon he and the others began the systematic execution of more than a thousand Muslim men and boys, ages 7 to 70. Kuvjela was found to have helped to coerce survivors from the warehouse with the promise of medical assistance, only to execute them with automatic rifles. The former police officer also used a pistol to execute those who showed signs of life after the initial killings. The prosecution has announced plans to appeal for a longer sentence in light of the nature of the crimes. The court ordered Kuvjela into custody in January 2011 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">confirmed his indictment</a> [JURIST report] for crimes including genocide that March.   

<p>The 1995 mass executions at Srebrenica have been characterized as the most horrific massacre since post-war Europe, as more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniak men and boys were murdered at the hands of Bosnian Serb military forces under General Ratko Mladic. In December, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bosnian-serb-sentenced-to-life-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a former Bosnian Serb army commander of genocide and crimes against humanity for his role in the massacre. BiH in particular has been continuously prosecuting, convicting and sentencing those responsible for the killings, and even those who left the country are being brought back to face charges. In December the BiH war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bosnia-court-acquits-two-former-policemen-in-srebrenica-massacre-case.php">acquitted two Serbian defendants</a> [JURIST report] of involvement in the massacre. In June the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bosnia-court-sentences-former-soldiers-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four former Bosnian Serb soldiers for their involvement in the massacre. In May US resident Dejan Radojkovic was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-resident-deported-to-bosnia-to-face-war-crimes-charges.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] to BiH to stand trial before the country's court for his actions as a police commander in Srebrenica during the 1995 massacre. He was the second to be deported after his commanding officer, Nedjo Ikonic, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">deported in 2010</a> [JURIST report]. A day earlier, the war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/two-bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-prison-for-roles-in-srebenica-massacre.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Dusko Jevic and Mendeljev Djuric for taking part in the killing of 1,000 Muslim men during the massacre after it found that the two former Bosnian Serb police officers were guilty of aiding and abetting genocide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the motion, the Chief Justice's actions have "plunged the entire Supreme Court and specially the office of the Chief Justice into disrepute." The actions of the Parliament were in response to allegations of corruption and bribery. The impeachment of the Chief Justice disregards a recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-high-court-finds-impeachment-proceeding-unlawful.php">Supreme Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that impeachment would be unlawful as the Parliament does not have the authority to investigate or proceed with the impeachment of a senior judge. <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a>, [official website] who has the support of more than two-thirds of Parliament's members, must now determine whether Bandaranayake should be removed from office.

<p>The impeachment Bandaranayake has recently been a source of great controversy. Earlier this month a UN independent expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the increasing threats and attacks against judges and lawyers who fight for the independence of the judiciary in Sri Lanka. Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/GKnaul.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a>, [official profile] called for the independence of the judiciary and criticized the parliament for exercising control over judicial matters, which violates the principle of separation of powers, due process and international standards. In mid-December Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her conviction of misconduct, arguing that she was not given adequate opportunity to present her defense. She was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of three out of five charges of misconduct by the parliamentary committee earlier that month. More than 300 of Sri Lanka's judges had met in the capital Colombo to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lankan-judges-demand-impartial-inquiry-into-charges-against-chief-justice.php">call for impartiality</a> [JURIST report] in the impeachment proceedings. In November, Knaul <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-ensure-safety-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to take appropriate measures to protect the country's judiciary from threats, intimidation and physical attacks. Earlier that month hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The rights group stated that little has changed within the totalitarian government since <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile] succeeded his father <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10745725">Kim Jong-il</a> [BBC obituary] in leading the country one year ago. HRW stated the situation may be getting worse, noting a drop in the number of individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdowns on escape attempts. The rights group also noted a recent UN <a href="http://www.wfp.org/node/3498/4572/257713">report</a> [press release] citing widespread malnutrition and hunger in the country. HRW called on the UN to create a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in the country:<blockquote>For more than 60 years, successive regimes have killed or starved millions, and the world has done little in response. No one should labor under the misperception that the regime can be influenced by negotiation, and reformed in some traditional sense. Only coordinated outside pressure has a chance to make an impact. Recording, exposing, condemning and calling for accountability for serious abuses may lead some in the regime to realize that there are potential costs to their behavior.</blockquote>HRW said a UN resolution will only pass with the support of the nations of the European Union, as well as South Korea, Japan and the US. The rights group called on those nations to voice support for a UN investigation of human rights in North Korea. 

<p>North Korea has faced ongoing international criticism for human rights violations. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Marzuki Darusman <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> over the lack of development in human rights in the nation, despite having <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-new-north-korea-leaders-to-address-human-rights-concerns.php">called</a> [JURIST reports] on new leader Kim Jong-un last January to improve the situation. In June the <a href="http://hrnk.org/">Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a> (HRNK) [advocacy website] reported that North Korea's <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/north-korea-caste-system-leads-to-human-rights-violations-report.php">caste system</a> [JURIST report] leads to abuses and human rights violations in the country. Darusman also <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the nation's human rights record in November 2011, focusing on the treatment of prisoners. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-246-Salinas-Cert-Petition-final-OK-TO-PRINT.pdf">Salinas v. Texas</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-246.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider the boundaries of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] right to remain silent prior to arrest. Genovevo Salinas was suspected of being involved in a murder. He consented to a search of his home, where police found a shotgun, and consented to questioning at the police station, but he was not arrested or given <a href = "http://www.mirandawarning.org/whatareyourmirandarights.html">Miranda warnings</a> [backgrounder]. An officer asked, "if the shotgun [his father had given them] would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder." Salinas looked down and refused to answer the question. The state then offered the refusal to answer as a key piece of evidence against Salinas, which he contends was a violation of his right against self-incrimination. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Salinas_v_State_369_SW3d_176_Tex_Crim_App_2012_Court_Opinion">upheld</a> [opinion text] the conviction.

<p>In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-10-Petition.pdf">Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-10.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider the <A href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] implications of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-83">US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003</a> [22 USC &#167; 7601 text], which bars funding to HIV/AIDS organizations that do not actively denounce <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=prostitution">prostitution</a> [JURIST news archive]. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-us-cannot-make-aids-funding-conditional-on-anti-prostitution-laws.php">struck down those provisions</a> [JURIST report], ruling that this unconstitutionally requires potential fund recipients to "espouse the government's views." Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself from hearing this case.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2012/2pet/7pet/2012-0418.pet.aa.pdf">US v. Kebodeaux</a> [cert. petition; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-418.htm">docket</a>] the court will review whether the federal government can compel a convicted sex offender to register with the <a href = "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4905/text">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [text] if they have completed their sentence before <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=SORNA">SORNA</a> [JURIST news archive] was enacted. The court has ruled on SORNA several times, including that it <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-on-sex-offender-registration-act.php">does not apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report] without guidance that the rule does apply to those offenders. The government is arguing that "<span class = "casename">Reynolds</span> addressed the narrow question of when and how SORNA's particular requirements become effective as to persons who committed their offense prior to its enactment. It does not address Congress' power to prescribe registration requirements for those offenders." The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Kebodeaux_687_F3d_232_5th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion text] that this provision violated <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a> [text] of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-357.htm">Sekhar v. US</a> [docket] the court will consider if blackmailing an attorney who is also employed by the government is a violation of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875">federal extortion law</a> [18 USC &#167; 875(d)], including the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/131mcrm.htm">Hobbs Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 1951 (a)]. Giridhar Sekhar allegedly <a href = "http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Federal-prison-for-would-be-extortionist-2202598.php">threatened to blackmail</a> [<em>Times Union</em> report] the attorney of New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli to gain a government contract. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Sekhar_683_F3d_436_2d_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">declared</a> [opinion text] the attorney's "recommendation" as intangible property of the state of New York, and thus under the jurisdiction of federal extortion law.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/11-1221-Hillman-v.-Maretta-Petition.pdf">Hillman v. Maretta</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1221.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider if the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8705">Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954</a> (FEGLIA) [text] preempts a state domestic relations equitable remedy which creates a cause of action against the recipient of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) proceeds after they have been distributed. The Virginia Supreme Court <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Maretta_v_Hillman_283_Va_34_722_SE2d_32_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion text] that "[b]ecause Congress intended for FEGLI benefits to be paid and to belong to a designated beneficiary, we conclude that FEGLIA preempts" the <a href = "http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+20-111.1">Virginia Code</a> [&#167; 20-111.1(D) text] in question."</p>

<p>Finally, the court granted another question on federal preemption in <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ATA-Petition_FINAL.pdf">American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-798.htm">docket</a>]. The court will consider <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/14501">49 USC &#167; 14501</a>(c)(1) [text], which provides that "a State [or] political subdivision ... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property" and contains an unexpressed "market participant" exception. The court will look at if this exemption permits a municipal governmental entity to take action that conflicts with the express preemption clause, if it occurs in a market in which the municipal entity does not participate, and is unconnected with any interest in the efficient procurement of services. The court will also look at if a required concession agreement setting out various conditions a motor carrier must meet to serve a particular port imposes any requirements that are "related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier" for the purposes of preemption under Section 14501(c)(1). Finally, the court will determine whether permitting a municipal governmental entity to bar federally licensed motor carriers from access to a port operates as a partial suspension of the motor carriers' federal registration is in violation of <A href = "http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Castle_v_Hayes_Freight_Lines_Inc_348_US_61_75_S_Ct_191_99_L_Ed_68">Castle v.

While It is not yet expected that the bank <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/11/us-jpmorgan-compliance-idUSBRE90A0DN20130111">will be fined</a> [Reuters report], the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department's</a> anti money-laundering unit, the <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/">Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN) [official wesbites], may undertake a separate action against JPMorgan. This inquiry into JPMorgan began several months ago. Regulators must issue cease-and-desist orders after they have instructed a bank to fully comply with the <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/regulations/31cfr103.htm">Bank Secrecy Act</a> [text] and the bank has failed to do so. The order can require a bank to review its past transactions and determine if it missed finding any suspicious activity that it should have reported to a regulatory agency, and with a high enough level of under reporting, regulators can issue civil fines. Additionally, although no action is expected from U.S. prosecutors yet, the OCC usually informs the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] of inquiries like JPMorgan's.

<p>JPMorgan has faced numerous lawsuits regarding its business practices. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Credit Union Administration </a>(NCUA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-credit-union-regulator-sues-jpmorgan-over-faulty-mortgage-securities.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against JPMorgan for the sale of $2.2 billion of faulty residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to credit unions. In December the NCUA brought a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/credit-union-agency-files-larges-suit-to-date-against-wall-street-firms.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPMorgan. In July JPMorgan agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/jpmorgan-agrees-to-100-million-settlement-in-credit-card-case.php">$100 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June the firm was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-for-jpmorgan-settlement.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. The settlement followed JPMorgan's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/jpmorgan-chase-agrees-to-pay-$228-million-for-fraudulent-bidding-on-municipal-bonds.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] last July with the DOJ to pay $228 million to federal and state authorities. One month earlier JPMorgan again <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for misleading investors during the housing crises.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Traore <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/11/world/africa/mali-france/index.html">called for</a> [CNN report] Mali to engage in a general mobilization to defend against the rebel's advance. France's President Francois Hollande issued a statement saying that <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/chronologie/#e2301,2013-01-11,declaration-du-president-de-la-republique-sur-la-situation-au-mali-3">France would aid Mali</a> [text, in French]. Hollande said France would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/11/us-mali-rebels-idUSBRE90912Q20130111">not watch the rebels push south</a> [Reuters report] toward the capital, Bamako, and assisted the government of Mali by providing air strikes against the rebels. After France's intervention and the assistance of troops from Senegal and Nigeria, the government of Mali was able to retake Konna. Peace talks between the government and some of the Islamist rebel groups were scheduled to occur in Burkina Faso on Thursday but have been postponed until January 21 because of the Konna conflict.

<p>The crisis in Mali has drawn a great deal of international scorn and scrutiny. The prime minister of Mali, Cheick Modibo Diarra, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-prime-minister-of.php">forced to resign</a> [JURIST report] in December on state television after junta soldiers arrested him for attempting to leave the country in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis threatening the nation. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and recruiting child soldiers. Earlier that month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems. Pillay noted that two militant Islamic groups are recruiting child soldiers, committing cruel punishments, violating basic human rights, committing sexual violence against women, and executing individuals. In August, officials from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] were in Mali <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-investigating-allegations-of-war-crimes-in-mali.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] whether the same two Islamic groups had committed war crimes in Mali.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chavez supporters are trying to keep details about his condition and treatment secret, with government agents going so far as to confiscate the computers of a blogger suspected of authoring tweets questioning official information provided about Chavez&#8217;s health. Although Chavez was unable to take office on January 10 because of his cancer, Venezuelan officials state that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/venezuela-will-not-hold-a-new-election-despite-chavez-critical-health.php">the country will not be holding a new election</a> [JURIST report], despite a constitutional mandate that the President be sworn in on January 10. In a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20957164">unanimous decision</a> [BBC report], the <a href="http://www.tsj.gov.ve/index.shtml">Supreme Tribunal of Justice</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled last Wednesday that the postponement of Chavez's inauguration for a new term in office is legal. 

<p>Chavez has been a controversial figure in the region. In July, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/venezuela-withdraws-from-human-rights-court.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the country would withdraw from the <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=487586&CFTOKEN=78136649">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish]. In a statement during a military ceremony, Chavez announced the withdrawal and criticized the regional court, saying it is not fit to be called a human rights court. The decision came just after the IACHR concluded that the prison conditions of a man convicted in multiple bombings were a violation of his human rights. In 2011, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/venezuela-president-criticizes-human-rights-court-ruling.php">criticized the IACHR</a> [JURIST report] for ruling in favor of presidential hopeful Leopoldo Lopez, allowing him to run for office despite a separate court ruling barring him from the election. In October 2011, the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/venezuela-high-court-rules-opposition-candidate-ineligible-to-run-for-president.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that presidential hopeful Leopoldo Lopez remained banned from running in next year's elections. Lopez, an opposition leader, was considered to be a threat to Chavez. As a result of corruption allegations, he was banned from public office through 2014 by the country's comptroller general.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new legislation would bring the new top-tier tax level to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/01/201311214144658999.html">42 percent</a> [Al Jazeera report] for individuals earning more than $56,000 a year, a drastic change from the previous top rate, which was 45 percent on incomes over $132,000. Greece's parliament seeks to boost state revenues by $3 billion through simplifying tax scales, reforming family benefits, increasing taxation on deposit interest and expanding the tax base to include groups such as low-earning farmers. Since Greece's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">economic crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2010 it has been kept solvent by rescue loans from the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website]. In exchange for the bailouts, Greece has implemented harsh austerity measures such as the new tax legislation to reduce its debt and budget deficit.

<p>Several EU member states face financial instability which may have detrimental effects on other member states. Last June, Ireland voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ireland-voters-approve-eu-fiscal-treaty.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://european-council.europa.eu/media/639235/st00tscg26_en12.pdf">Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance</a> [text, PDF] aimed at improving fiscal discipline and promoting greater financial information disclosure between EU member states because of its current financial situation. The treaty was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/03/eu-leaders-sign-fiscal-treaty.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by leaders from 25 EU member states in March. Only two countries, the UK and the Czech Republic, did not sign the measure. A year after the financial crisis of 2008, a <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/">European Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/eu-to-create-europe-financial.php">decided to create</a> [JURIST report] a new European financial supervisory and monitoring system which seeks to balance the need of coordinating efforts on financial supervision, particularly in times of crisis, with the autonomy of each member nation over their own financial stability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hGqq1l34cLVgn_jITZ_yGnbdH2jg?docId=cf04f9919d7f4fc68d24794470cb4fe1">did not give his reasons</a> [AP report] for ordering the new trial, but the reasons are expected to be released later. A retrial was anticipated after the trial judge made it clear during the trial in June that the prosecution lacked hard evidence to support the conviction. Sunday's order also overturned the conviction of former Security Chief Habib el-Adli for the same charges and ordered a retrial for him as well. It also demanded a re-trial of six of Mubarak's aides who were acquitted on charges relating to the same incident and overturned a not-guilty verdict for Mubarak's two sons and his associate Hussein Salem for corruption charges. The dates for the retrials have not been determined yet.

<p>Egyptian prosecutors in June revealed plans to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-prosecutor-to-appeal-mubarak-trial-verdict.php">appeal the verdict</a> [JURIST report] in Mubarak's trial because they wanted to overturn the acquittals of his sons and associates. Under Egyptian law, they were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-06-03/egypt-mubarak-verdicts/55359136/1">forced to appeal the entire verdict</a> [AP report] in order to appeal any part of it. The <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">original verdict</a> [JURIST report] was announced in June after a 10 month trial, and gave a life sentence to both Mubarak and el-Adli. The June verdict marked the first time a former Arab leader had been held accountable for his actions in a court of law. The lead prosecutor in the case had <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-for-mubarak-in-closing-remarks.php">asked for the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] for Mubarak at the conclusion of his trial in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The president's action comes just two days after the <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/ListContent.do?language=E">Sri Lankan Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-parliament-votes-to-impeach-chief-justice.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] with an overwhelming majority to impeach the chief justice and drafted an <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/news/ViewPublication.do?published=Y&documentID=PUB4346">official motion</a> [materials] urging the president to remove the Chief Justice. The president said in his order that he was in agreement with the parliament's request for Bandaranayake's removal, despite a recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-high-court-finds-impeachment-proceeding-unlawful.php">Supreme Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that said impeachment would be illegal because parliament does not have the authority to investigate or impeach a senior judge. The removal order was delivered to Bandaranayake's residence on Sunday morning.

<p>The parliament's investigation into the chief justice has been the center of controversy in Sri Lanka and has been criticized by rights groups. Earlier this month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the chief justice's impeachment proceedings, saying they were "extremely politicized and characterized by lack of transparency, lack of clarity in the proceedings, as well as lack of respect for the fundamental guarantees of due process and fair trial." In December, Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">guilty verdict</a> [JURIST reports] made against her earlier that month  by a parliamentary committee on three charges of misconduct. The charges she was found guilty of dealt with conflict of interest, claiming of assets for tax assessment purposes and bias in handling a case against her husband.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In December Sudanese authorities shut down four organizations in Khartoum that promoted cultural diversity, democracy and human rights. The government shut down these groups based on alleged national security concerns. In the press release, HRW's Africa director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/daniel-bekele">Daniel Bekele</a> [official profile] declared that the crackdown is detrimental to human rights and does not advance any legitimate governmental purpose: <blockquote>Sudan should reverse its draconian steps against civil society groups, and international actors should publicly condemn such measures. The government-led campaign against Sudanese civil society organizations seems designed to stifle diversity, human rights, and dialogue on issues of critical importance, rather than to serve any legitimate purpose.</blockquote> HRW also accused Sudan's government of intimidating protesters and stifling freedom of the press.

<p>Sudan's human rights record has been the subject of international scrutiny recently. In October the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] called on Sudanese authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">investigate an attack on one of its convoys</a> [JURIST report]. In August the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">called on Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to investigate violent and excessive force by the government against protesters. In July <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] and HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-urge-sudan-government-to-end-abuse-of-protesters.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end violence and abuse against protesters. In June the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-calls-on-sudan-government-to-improve-humanitarian-conditions.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about deteriorating conditions in Sudan due to continued violent conflict in the country. Earlier that month UN Independent Expert on Human Rights in Sudan, Mashood Adebayo Baderin stated the country still <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-sudan-must-improve-human-rights.php">must take further steps</a> [JURIST report] towards implementing its human rights obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amnesty was opposed by President Mikhail Saakashvili and has intensified a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/13/georgia-amnesty-idUSL6N0AH3IH20130113">power struggle</a> [Reuters report] within the country. Many of the prisoners who were released were arrested in May 2011 during anti-Saakashvili <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/190-georgian-political-prisoners-walk-free-102321999.html">protests</a> [AP report]. Approximately 3,000 total prisoners will be released in the next two months as part of the amnesty agreement approved by parliament in December. Saakashvili vetoed the agreement approved by parliament but parliament was able to overturn the veto, further exacerbated tensions between the government and parliament. 

<p>In December Georgian Chief Prosecutor Archil Kbilashvili <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/former-justice-minister-in-georgia-to-be-formally-charged.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the former justice minister in Georgia, Justice Minister Zurab Adeishvili, was set to be charged on December 26 in connection with the torture of prisoners in the country's capital of Tbilisi. The prosecution investigated allegations of torture in the prison. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called on authorities in Georgia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-human-rights-chief-urges-georgia-to-investigate-prison-torture.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] prisoner mistreatment after video footage allegedly depicted the torture and rape of prisoners in the country's capital of Tbilisi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay expressed concern that the international community is almost exclusively focused on North Korea's nuclear program and not on human rights. Pillay had hoped that the new leadership would bring improvements in North Korea's human rights record but a year after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile] assumed leadership in the country there appears to be no improvements in the North Korea's human rights record. Pillay met with survivors from North Korea's political prison camp, which is believed to contain more 200,000 political prisoners or more. In addition to punishing peaceful activities, the practices in the camp also include torture and other forms of cruel and inhumane treatment. Pillay stated:<blockquote>They described a system that represents the very antithesis of international human rights norms. We know so little about these camps, and what we do know comes largely from the relatively few refugees who have managed to escape from the country. The highly developed system of international human rights protection that has had at least some positive impact in almost every country in the world, seems to have completely bypassed DPRK, where self-imposed isolation has allowed the government to mistreat its citizens to a degree that should be unthinkable in the 21st century.</blockquote>Pillay emphasized the need to obtain access into the country in order to provide human rights protections. 

<p>North Korea has faced ongoing international criticism for human rights violations. Last week Human Rights Watch (HRW) called for a UN commission to examine <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">human rights abuses in North Korea</a> [JURIST report]. The rights group stated that little has changed within the totalitarian government since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10745725">Kim Jong-il</a> [BBC obituary] in leading the country one year ago. HRW stated the situation may be getting worse, noting a drop in the number of individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdowns on escape attempts. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK Marzuki Darusman <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> over the lack of development in human rights in the nation, despite having <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-new-north-korea-leaders-to-address-human-rights-concerns.php">called</a> [JURIST reports] on new leader Kim Jong-un last January to improve the situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The working group stated that it "remains concerned at the persistence of loopholes and ambiguities which, if not removed, might undermine the protection of women's rights and the principle of gender equality." While the working group has recognized the value of the new constitution in correcting gross inequalities and advancing the important virtues of justice, democracy and human rights, the group expressed concerns that the second draft failed to include clauses prohibiting discrimination, including on the grounds of sex. The UN group voiced its disapproval of the lack of constitutional mechanisms to monitor compliance with measures to eliminate discrimination and inequality affecting women in Tunisia. In particular, the working group called on Tunisian officials, at all levels of government to work to reach out to rural women, to increase there capacity to participate fully in the political and social life of the nation, citing their key role in historic reform the country has been undergoing. 

<p>Tunisia has faced political turmoil since former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. In August the same UN Working Group <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-calls-on-tunisia-to-protect-womens-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Tunisia to ensure that women's rights are protected in line with the nation's international human rights obligations. Last month, the same UN Working Group <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed similar concern</a> [JURIST report] over Egypt's, then draft, <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2012.09.20_-_draft_constitution_-_english.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF], stating that, "women's perspectives were grossly under-represented in the final draft." The working group expressed concern that equality between the sexes is not among the draft's substantive provisions and urged further critical review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI estimates that approximately 350,000 Haitians still live in nearly 500 makeshift camps where living conditions are allegedly worsening due to limited access to water and grossly ineffective sanitation and waste disposal methods. AI states that these issues have led to the spread of infectious diseases, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR36/001/2011/en/57237fad-f97b-45ce-8fdb-68cb457a304c/amr360012011en.pdf">sexual assault</a> [text, PDF] and the ever-present fear of eviction by private and government entities. In addition, AI questions Haiti's <a href="http://haitigrassrootswatch.squarespace.com/storage/Politique_Nationale_Logement_Final_2012_05_03.pdf">National Policy on Housing</a> [text, in French], which was enacted in April 2012 with the goal of prioritizing construction of new housing. AI asserts that the policy does not adequately address conditions for those already living in poverty, and provides no answer for those who cannot access adequate and affordable housing. AI also questions the efficacy of Project <a href="http://www.usaim.org/page15.php">16/6</a> [official website], a privately supported August 2011 national initiative that seeks to relocate the homeless from camps to housing neighborhoods. AI worries that while families receive a year-long rent subsidy of USD $500, the amounts are too low to support individuals and families "in the long-term." AI elaborates: <blockquote>Many people told Amnesty International delegates in Haiti of their worries about not knowing where they would live after the end of the subsidies, as they would not be able to afford the rent. As it is, they are currently struggling to feed themselves and their children, let alone pay for other basic essentials such as clothing, medicine and education.</blockquote>AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/urgent-plan-needed-tackle-housing-crisis-haiti-2012-02-10-0">urges</a> [press release] for renewed prioritization of support for the Haitian people from both national authorities and the international community as a whole. 

<p>On January 12, 2010 a 7.0 magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 Haitians and caused massive damage to property and infrastructure. Local police <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-confronts-rising-lawlessness.php">struggled to maintain law and order</a> [JURIST report] in Haiti while awaiting the deployment of US troops, as looting and vigilantism rose among increasingly desperate and frustrated survivors of the earthquake that struck the country. The international community along with the US sought to provide aid initially. In January 2010 US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-approves-tax-benefit-for-haiti.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that allowed Americans to claim contributions made to Haitian earthquake relief efforts as a deduction on their 2009 federal income tax returns. Also in January the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-grants-humanitarian-parole-to-haiti.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US would allow Haitian orphans into the country to receive needed care in the aftermath of the earthquake. In the same timeframe the DHS announced that Haitian nationals already present in the US on January 12 would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-removal-of-illegal-haitians-put-on.php">granted Temporary Protected Status</a> [JURIST report] and would be allowed to continue living and working in the US for the next 18 months regardless of their immigration status.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The demonstrators were calling for peace in Myanmar's war-torn <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/burma0312ForUpload_1_0.pdf">Kachin State</a> [HRW report, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kachin">news archive</a>]. According to HRW, the protesters have been repeatedly summoned to police stations and charged with violating section 18 of the <a href="http://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/3440/12-09-19-LA-Myanmar.pdf">2011 Law Relating to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession</a> [Article19 analysis, PDF], which requires a permit for demonstrations. HRW called on Myanmar to reform the peaceful assembly law. HRW deputy Asia director Phil Robertson stated: <blockquote>The government's prosecution of peaceful demonstrators reveals troubling limits on Burma's respect for basic rights. Burma's leaders may be saying the right things at global forums and in bilateral talks, but their reform rhetoric rings hollow on the streets and in the fields where protesters assemble.</blockquote>HRW stated that authorities have been using the Peaceful Assembly Law at their discretion to prosecute rather than protect individuals exercising their basic rights. 

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently. In October HRW called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end to the sectarian violence</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. In August Physicians for Human Rights reported that Myanmar's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">army is still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-myanmar-ethnic-clashes.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about both the continued violence in Myanmar and the human rights abuses that have occurred as a result.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Only top-officials, military and police entities will be exempt from the law's  proscriptive scope, which punishes violators with up to a six-year jail term. According to media sources, the ban is <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/23950">predicated on a national desire for peaceful elections</a> [AP report] in the wake of the nation's history of political violence, and in particular, an especially bloody 2009 <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">clash in the southern Maguindanao Province</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] that killed 58. Military and police contingents are charged with enforcing the law in nearly 800 cities across the nation, where sources allege that more than 60 private militias and 50 criminal gangs may seek to influence election results by way of intimidation and violence. The ban is part of national initiative led by <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph">President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website] that seeks to mitigate gun violence with more restrictive gun-ownership and possession laws. According to sources, 50 million Philippine citizens are expected to cast their vote in May for nearly 18,000 national and local political positions, including 300 seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives.

<p>Philippine political clashes, and in particular, the events at Maguindanao have led to serious debate about gun violence in the nation. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the 2009 Maguindanao massacre is the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/2012/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2011-philippines.php">single deadliest event for the press</a> [CPJ report] since the CPJ began keeping records of journalists deaths in 1992. In the last 20 years, at least 72 journalists have been killed for their work in the Philippines, making it the second deadliest country in the world for journalists behind Iraq. Litigation surrounding the Maguindanao massacre has been a source of contentious debate. In November 2012 Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/stronger-protection-for-witnesses-of-2009-philippines-massacre-is-necessary-ai.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Philippine authorities to put a stop to the killings of Maguindanao massacre witnesses and their families. Earlier that month, the Philippines high court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/philippines-high-court-rescinds-decision-to-broadcast-maguindanao-massacre-trial.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a year-old decision to allow for live broadcast of the trial, a rescission that was opposed by Aquino on the grounds that it could impede the transparency of the trial. In June 2011 the court also <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippines-court-freezes-23-million-assets-of-massacre-suspects.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to freeze $23 million in assets belonging to massacre suspects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN agency has voiced grave concern of the lives of the refugees who have boarded boats operating by smuggler rings. There is only speculation on the destination of the refugees, with UN expecting most to land in other parts of South-east Asia. Last year, according to the refugee agency, more than 13,000 people were transported by smugglers out of the Bay of Bengal, with 485 confirmed deaths in a number of boating accidents during the same period. The UNHCR fears that the refugee crisis may increase following strife in northern Myanmar which has displaced over 115,000 people within the state, with tens of thousands residing in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. A UNHCR spokesperson urged regional nations to ensure humane treatment of the refugees and stated:<blockquote>This growing boatpeople crisis calls for regional approaches and solutions. UNHCR encourages the government of Myanmar to intensify measures to address some of the main push factors...the lack of sustainable development and the resulting widespread poverty, the lack of rights for an important part of the population and recognition of the economic interdependence of all communities in Rakhine state.</blockquote>The refugee population is predominantly Muslims from Rakhine state, many who fled to Bangladesh in the 1990's during similar periods of inter-communal violence.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationship with the US. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end to the sectarian violence in Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, calling on the government to do more to end the violence and protect the rights of the Rohingya, whose civil rights were effectively taken away with their citizenship in 1982. In August physicians for Human Rights reported that Myanmar's army <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">is still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state.

The petition <a href="http://en.ria.ru/politics/20130114/178770385.html">asked</a> [RIA Novosti report] the government to lift the controversial ban. A Russian newspaper company, <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/">Novaya Gazeta</a> [media website, in Russian] had collected more than 100,000 signatures via the Internet. However, the committee of parliament's lower house, after formal discussions, determined that the signatures lacked verification and thus, could not be given further consideration. Although the State Duma has to review petitions that are supported by 100,000 or more citizens, it is not required under the law to submit such petitions to the entire house for a vote. 

<p>A spokesperson for Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] had announced last week that Russia will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-delays-enforcement-of-us-adoption-ban-law.php">delay</a> [JURIST report] the enforcement of the controversial law until January 2014. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">signed into law</a> by Putin in December after both the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-upper-house-of-parliament-backs-ban-on-us-adoptions.php">upper house of parliament</a>, the Federation Council, and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-lawmakers-approve-ban-on-us-adoptions.php">State Duma</a> [JURIST reports] approved it. RAPSI, a legal information agency which operates in coordination with Russian courts, reports the Yakovlev initiative was <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121221/265867961.html">adopted in retaliation</a> [RAPSI report] for the US adoption of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text], which imposes US travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The bill was named for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367143.stm">Sergei Magnitsky</a> [BBC report], a Russian whistle-blower who was arrested on <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption,%20torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">charges of tax fraud and later died in prison</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rajapaksa dismissed Bandaranayake after parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-parliament-votes-to-impeach-chief-justice.php">voted to impeach her</a> [JURIST report] in response to allegations of corruption and bribery. The impeachment vote disregarded a recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-high-court-finds-impeachment-proceeding-unlawful.php">Supreme Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that impeachment would be unlawful as Parliament does not have the authority to investigate or proceed with the impeachment of a senior judge. The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130115/as-sri-lanka-chief-justice/?utm_hp_ref=homepage&ir=homepage">swearing in</a> [AP report] of the new chief justice could lead to a judicial crisis if lawyers and judges who say the impeachment was illegal refuse to cooperate with Peiris.

<p>The impeachment Bandaranayake has been a source of great controversy. Earlier this month a UN independent expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-sri-lanka-stop-attacks-on-judiciary.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the increasing threats and attacks against judges and lawyers who fight for the independence of the judiciary in Sri Lanka. Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/GKnaul.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] called for the independence of the judiciary and criticized the parliament for exercising control over judicial matters, which violates the principle of separation of powers, due process and international standards. In mid-December Bandaranayake <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-appeals-parliamentary-findings-of-misconduct.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her conviction of misconduct, arguing that she was not given adequate opportunity to present her defense. She was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of three out of five charges of misconduct by the parliamentary committee earlier that month. More than 300 of Sri Lanka's judges had met in the capital Colombo to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lankan-judges-demand-impartial-inquiry-into-charges-against-chief-justice.php">call for impartiality</a> [JURIST report] in the impeachment proceedings. In November Knaul <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-ensure-safety-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to take appropriate measures to protect the country's judiciary from threats, intimidation and physical attacks. Earlier that month hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-9335.pdf">Alleyne v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF], the court heard arguments on whether to overturn <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_United_States_536_US_545_122_S_Ct_2406_153_L_Ed_2d_524_2">Harris v. United States</a> [opinion]. <span class="casename">Harris</span> was a 5-4 splintered opinion that allowed a judge to be the fact-finder when increasing mandatory minimum sentences, as opposed to requiring the question to go to the jury. Since the case was decided, the court has gained three new members, and two in the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, have left the court. Counsel for the petitioner argued, "Any fact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence more severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt." Counsel for the US urged the court to adhere to its ruling in <span class="casename">Harris</span>, "because those decisions properly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum divests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-9953.pdf">Boyer v. Louisiana</a> [transcript, PDF], the court considered a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] case directly on appeal from the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/State_v_Boyer_56_So_3d_1119_La_Ct_App_2011_Court_Opinion">Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit</a> [opinion]. At issue is if the state violates the "speedy trial clause" by not paying court-appointed counsel in a timely manner. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the Louisiana court incorrectly determined that the cause of the delay was beyond the control of the state. Counsel for Louisiana argued that while the delay may have been within the state's control, the court should nonetheless uphold the lower court's reasoning. Much media attention was given to the fact that Justice Clarence Thomas, known for remaining silent during oral arguments, broke his seven-year silence during this argument with the words "Well&#8212;he did not." It is unclear exactly what he meant, but he spoke in response to questioning from Justice Antonin Scalia about the lawyer in the case being Harvard educated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In one case, the ECHR ruled in favor of a British Airways employee who had been instructed not to wear a crucifix at work. However, in two other cases it ruled that employers did not violate their employees' religious rights after disciplining them for refusing to offer services to homosexual individuals. It also turned down an appeal from a woman who was not allowed to wear a crucifix at the hospital that employed her because she did not show that her Muslim co-workers who wanted to wear religious clothing and articles were treated more favorably than Christian workers. In its decisions the court cited Article 9 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which protects the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It is expected that the losing plaintiffs will appeal the decision to the ECHR Grand Chamber. If upheld, these decisions will force employers to find a balance between protecting their employees' religious rights and not discriminating against other groups of people, especially members of the LGBT community.

<p>Increasing laws protecting homosexuals from discrimination have caused conflicts between secular governments and those religious institutions that take issue with homosexuality. In 2010 the <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/">UK Charity Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/uk-charity-commission-rules-adoption-agency-cannot-discriminate-against-gay-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Catholic social services agency <a href="http://www.catholic-care.org.uk/">Catholic Care</a> [agency website] may not restrict its adoption services to married heterosexual couples. In March of the same year the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">UK High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-high-court-rules-catholic-adoption.php">issued a judgment</a> [JURIST report] instructing the commission to reconsider a previous ruling on the adoption service's practice citing that respect for religious views is not a justification for discrimination in this particular case, because adoptions are a public service.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21022855">court order</a> [BBC report] states that Ashraf and the others should be arrested and produced before the court within 24 hours. According to Pakistan's Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting <a href="http://www.infopak.gov.pk/informationminister.aspx">Qamar Zaman Kaira</a> [official profile], the law ministry and prime minister have not yet received a written order from the Supreme Court. Ashraf has denied the allegations.

<p>Ashraf's brief term as Prime Minister has been fraught with conflict and tension between the executive and the judiciary. Ashraf's predecessor, Yousuf Raza Gilani, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">forced out</a> as prime minister last June after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">convicted him of contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president. In July, only a month after Ashraf became prime minister, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-high-court-orders-new-pm-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">ordered him to reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] within three weeks. The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-shield-pm-from-contempt-proceedings.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to shield senior officials from contempt of court proceedings, which was widely seen as an attempt to exempt Ashraf from possible claims of contempt for failing to follow the order. When Ashraf did not do as the court requested, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-high-court-postpones-order-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">granted him</a> [JURIST report] another two weeks to comply with its order. When in early August Ashraf still did not reopen the investigation, the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-orders-to-explain-refusal-to-reopen-case-against-president.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] him to appear and explain his refusal to comply with the July orders. After his appearance in court, the Supreme Court then <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-grants-pm-additional-time-to-reopen-presidential-corruption-case.php">granted Ashraf an additional three weeks</a> to reopen the corruption case. Finally, in mid-September, Ashraf agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pakistan-pm-to-allow-switzerland-to-reopen-corruption-charges-against-president.php">allow the corruption case to be reopened</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In this joint letter, Switzerland, along with 56 other states from all continents, noted the Syrian authorities' <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/dozens-un-members-urge-immediate-icc-referral-desperate-situation-syria-2013-01-14">failure to investigate and prosecute</a> [AI report] war crimes allegedly committed since March 2011 as the basis for much-needed accountability and judicial action in the region. The letter stated: "Since [March 2011], the situation on the ground has only become more desperate, with attacks on the civilian population and the commission of atrocities having almost become the norm." Due to the fact that Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute, the founding treaty of the ICC, the only way to investigate the matter is to receive a referral from the UN Security Council.

<p>More than <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">60,000 people have been killed</a> [JURIST report] during a 21-month-old revolt against <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder], which began with protests that quickly turned into violence between Assad's forces and demonstrators. A study carried out by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported that the average number of deaths per month has increased significantly since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012.

Intelligence officials from Romania and the US  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/romanian-ex-defense-official-indicted-for-attempted-iran-arms-dealing-can-be-extradited-to-us/2013/01/15/1a8024be-5ef9-11e2-9dc9-bca76dd777b8_story.html">coordinated their investigations</a> [WP report] in the case. According to <a href="http://www.iranwatch.org/">Iran Watch</a> [advocacy website], a nuclear weapon watchdog group, Aurel Fratila was <a href="http://www.iranwatch.org/suppliers/records/jamshid-ghassemi.html">indicted</a> [Iran Watch backgrounder] in the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] in 2006 for allegedly conspiring to ship sensitive military equipment without US licenses to Romania with the ultimate goal of transporting the material to Iran.

<p>Iran's nuclear program continues to raise international concern. In August UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-sg-concerned-about-iran-human-rights.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about Iran's human rights conditions and nuclear program during a visit to Tehran. Earlier that month US President Barack Obama announced two <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/obama-announces-new-sanctions-against-iran.php">new economic sanctions</a> [JURIST report] on Iran's oil exports that aim to cut the country's financial transactions with the Chinese and Iraqi banks allegedly doing business with Tehran. In the first of these orders Obama explained that the penalties were imposed to prevent funding for "Iran's illicit proliferation activities." In March, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/ecj-upholds-sanctions-on-iran-based-bank.php">upheld a lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] that a UK subsidiary of Bank Melli Iran (BMI) can be included in a list of entities engaged in nuclear proliferation.

The 29-page report, titled "Hear No Evil: Forced Labor and Corporate Responsibility in Eritrea's Mining Sector," documents the failure of Vancouver-based company <a href="http://www.nevsun.com">Nevsun Resources</a> [corporate website] to prevent forced labor practices in the construction of its mine. Nevsun was the first company to develop an operational mine in Eritrea. After beginning its gold ore excavation in 2011, the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/15/eritrea-mining-investors-risk-use-forced-labor">company produced</a> [HRW press release] upwards of $614 million worth of ore in its first year of operation. HRW alleges that the Eritrean government's national service program requires all able-bodied men and women to serve indefinitely as conscripts for the government, and it assigns some of these conscripts to state-owned construction companies. It forces citizens into terms of forced labor, and HRW claims participants are regularly subjected to torture, abuse and threats of violence against family members for misconduct or attempted desertion. The government then allegedly exerts pressure on international mining firms to hire these companies to develop the infrastructure for their projects. These allegations were also documented in a 2009 HRW report titled, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2009/04/15/service-life-0">Service for Life: State Repression and Indefinite Conscription in Eritrea</a> [text].   

<p>The international community has become increasingly concern with forced labor issues and human rights abuses in Eritrea. In June UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eritrea-failing-to-address-human-rights-violations-un-rights-chief.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Eritrea for its failure to address the human rights violations in the country. These sentiments came on the heels of the <a href="http://www.state.gov">US State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/index.htm">Trafficking in Persons Report 2009</a> [22 USC &#167; 78 text], which added Eritrea and five other countries to its list of countries with the worst human trafficking records. In conjunction with the report's publication, Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/115321.htm">Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] called for an end to what she sees as "modern slavery," and emphasized the broad global impact such trafficking can have on national economies and public health and safety.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Despite requests from Saudi prosecutors for the death penalty, el-Gezawi was given a <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=169422693">sentence</a> [NPR report] of five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. El-Gezawi's arrest in April 2012 <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/28/saudi-arabia-recalls-egypt-ambassador">sparked protests</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] outside the Saudi Embassy in Cairo by those who believe the activist was arrested for insulting King Abdullah, leading Saudi Arabia to close its embassy in Egypt for a week. Saudi authorities maintain that he was arrested for attempting to smuggle 20,000 anti-anxiety pills into the country. El-Gezawi had previously filed lawsuits on behalf of 34 Egyptians who were detained in Saudi Arabia without a stated reason. The <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/">Arabic Network for Human Rights Information</a> (ANHRI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=10829">denounced the decision</a> [press release] as a political sentence that violates principles of freedom of expression. 

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against opposition leaders and human rights activists. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression. In August a number of human rights groups sent a letter to the Saudi Ministry of Justice requesting that <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">trials against activists be made public</a> [JURIST report]. Last January the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights</a> [official website] issued a report which criticized Saudi Arabia for its <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-criticizes-increased-use-of-capital-punishment-in-saudi-arabia.php">increased use of capital punishment</a> [JURIST report] and for using torture in order to obtain confessions.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The first, <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1351.pdf">Levin v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-reverses-west-virginia-redistricting-ruling.php">report</a>] concerned whether the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1089">Gonzales Act</a> [10 USC &#167; 1089 text] properly immunizes government medical personnel against battery suits. The Gonzales Act allows that certain medical malpractice suits may only be brought against the US under the <A href = "http://bphc.hrsa.gov/ftca/">Federal Torts Claims Act</a> (FTCA) [official website], but the FTCA includes a waiver for battery suits. Steven Levin's attorney argued that the Gonzales Act was created precisely to allow medical malpractice suits against the government as opposed to individuals employed by the government:<blockquote>[W]hat the intentional tort exception provides is&#8212;actually what it says is: "The provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any case arising out of assault, battery," and so on. And by eliminating that, the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise totally applicable to cases of medical battery, like this, or other claims of intentional tort. And so for cases covered by the Gonzalez Act; that is, cases of medical malpractice committed within the scope of employment by the doctors of the certain specified agencies that Congress has named for those cases, there is no intentional tort exception, and therefore, you can bring an action against the government.</blockquote>The government argued that, for the petitioner to win, the Gonzales Act has to waive sovereign immunity explicitly: "There is nothing in that legislative history that says it is&#8212;it thought 1089(e) nullified the intentional tort exception. It says it's patterned after the Gonzalez Act, and then it changed the main language, the opening proviso of that provision."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1447.pdf">Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-7-cases-including-seed-patent-dispute.php">report</a>] where it considered if the government taking of land after an owner refuses to act in compliance with a permit is a violation of the Takings Clause of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [backgrounder]. Carl Koontz refused to contribute money to protect the wetlands in order to get a permit to redevelop some acres of land. The St. Johns River Water Management District then denied his permit, but did not take his land. Koontz's attorney argued that although not an official taking, forcing Koontz to make a conservation easement on his property violated <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Nollan+v.+California+Coastal+Commission&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=10841693014473793601&scilh=0">Nolan v. California Coastal Commission</a> and <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8551511773686011796&q=Dolan+v.+City+of+Tigard&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Dolan v. Tigard</a> [opinions]. The water management district suggested Koontz failed to take sufficient actions to get his permit. "The parties agree that Florida may require a landowner to perform mitigation as a condition for a permit that would allow the destruction of a wetlands. The parties disagreed as to how much mitigation was appropriate in this case. The district thought that Mr. Koontz's proposal was insufficient to mitigate the damage to wetlands. Mr. Koontz rejected the district's counterproposals and he refused to do anything more. And the district denied his permit application because he refused to do anything more."</p>]]></content:encoded>

City of Riviera Beach</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in-corporate-liability-case-from-last-term.php">report</a>] that a houseboat permanently docked to land is not a vessel for purposes of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/3">1 USC &#167; 3</a> [text] and thus is not under <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00670.htm">federal maritime jurisdiction</a> [DOJ backgrounder]. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice Stephen Breyer. Echoing the oral arguments before the decision, the opinion emphasized the broadness of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit's <a href = "http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/City_of_Riviera_Beach_v_That_Certain_Unnamed_Gray_TwoStory_Vessel">decision</a> [opinion]:<blockquote> Not <em>every</em> floating structure is a "vessel." To state the obvious, a wooden washtub, a plastic dishpan, a swimming platform on pontoons, a large fishing net, a door taken off its hinges, or Pinocchio (when inside the whale) are not "vessels," even if they are "artificial contrivance[s]"capable of floating, moving under tow, and incidentally carrying even a fair-sized item or two when they do so. Rather, the statute applies to an "artificial contrivance ... capable of being used ... <em>as a means of transportation on water</em>." ... "[T]ransportation" involves the "conveyance (of things or persons) from one place to another." ... And we must apply this definition in a "practical," not a "theoretical," way. Consequently, in our view a structure does not fall within the scope of this statutory phrase unless a reasonable observer, looking to the home's physical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water.</blockquote>Breyer also created a rule for future vessel-defining courts: "[If a] reasonable observer, looking to the home's physical characteristics and activities, would consider it designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things over water." Fane Lozman's houseboat was sold and destroyed due to a District Court order. The court ruled this did not moot the issue due to the potential of Lozman receiving damages. Lozman was <a href = "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/court-rules-lozmans-floating-home-not-covered-unde/nTxKy/">elated over the victory</a> [<em>Palm Beach Post</em> report].

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy, dissented from the opinion, although the dissent agrees with much of the decision. "The Court, however, creates a novel and unnecessary 'reasonable observer' reformulation of these principles and errs in its determination, under this new standard, that the craft before us is not a vessel. Given the underdeveloped record below, we should remand."</p>]]></content:encoded>

O'Malley <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=7999">stated</a> [text] that the death penalty was expensive and ineffective. The governor had previously attempted to <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/maryland-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">repeal the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in Maryland in 2007, but the attempt failed. Following the failed repeal, O'Malley created the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/maryland-general-assembly-backs-death.php">Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment</a> [JURIST report] in 2008. The commission found that there was one exonerated innocent person for every 8.7 Americans on to receive the death penalty, that death penalty showed a racial bias, that no administrative fixes could address the racial disparity, and that the cost to taxpayers of pursuing a capital case was three times the cost of a life sentence without parole. The governor cited to those results as one reason he was re-introducing a repeal. On the decision to attempt the repeal again, O'Malley said:<blockquote>To govern is to choose. And particularly in an era of limited budget resources, every dollar that we choose to spend on a policy that is wasteful and does not work&#8212;when instead we could be doing more of the things that do work to protect life&#8212;seems to me to run counter to the pragmatic "do the things that work" governance that is the hallmark of our State, and what our people desire. The death penalty does not work in terms of preventing violent crime and the taking of human life. If you look over 30 or 40 years, the death penalty was on the books, and yet Baltimore still became the most violent and addicted city in America. Having the death penalty on the books did nothing to keep the homicides from rising.</blockquote>O'Malley will file the legislation this week.

<p>In April Connecticut became the seventeenth state to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">abolish the death penalty</a> and the fifth to do so in the previous five years. <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports] have all recently eliminated the death penalty, while 34 states retain its use. However, California voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/california-modifies-three-strikes-law-keeps-death-penalty-in-referendum.php">declined to repeal</a> the death penalty on the most recent ballot, with 47 percent of voters supporting the repeal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Cuomo's office issued a <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/01152013-outline-of-nys-groundbreaking-gun-legislation">press release</a> [official statement] touting the legislation:<blockquote>New York will be the first state in the nation to ban any magazine that can hold more than seven rounds and run instant background checks on all ammunition purchases at the time of sale. The legislation will allow authorities to track ammunition purchases in real time to alert law enforcement to high volume buys, and will include a statewide standard requiring recertification of pistol permits every five years. The legislation also closes a private sale loophole to ensure all gun purchases are subject to a background check, and toughens criminal penalties on those who use illegal guns.</blockquote>The <a href="http://home.nra.org">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] was <a href="http://www.nraila.org/legislation/state-legislation/2013/1/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-seizes-your-gun-rights-overnight-with-secret-deals,-procedural-shortcuts-and-midnight-votes-in-albany.aspx">quick to denounce</a> [statement] the legislation, saying that Cuomo "took a hatchet to gun rights in New York with lightning speed" and suggested the group would pursue legislative and judicial means to vacate the law.

<p>This story is the latest development in the Second Amendment and <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST comment] in the US. Last month the NRA <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/nra-ceo-dismisses-renewal-of-ban-on-assault-weapons.php">restated its objection</a> [JURIST report] to reinvigorated calls for an assault weapons ban following the Newtown shooting. In July Florida Governor Rick Scott announced that his state would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-to-appeal-federal-court-ruling-striking-down-state-gun-law.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] ruling that struck down a Florida law that barred doctors from discussing the dangers of gun ownership with patients. In July 2010 the Chicago City Council unanimously approved a new gun control law that bans gun shops in the city and prohibits gun owners from stepping outside their homes, including porches and garages, with a handgun. Shortly thereafter a group of Chicago citizens, supported by both the NRA and the National Association of Firearm Retailers, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit against the city</a> [JURIST report] claiming the new ordinance infringes on their constitutional rights. In June 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZO.html">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government, thereby overturning Chicago's ban on handguns and raising considerable uncertainty about what amount of regulations of firearms was permissible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Human rights group <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%202013%20Booklet.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on Wednesday detailing the state of democracy in the world. The report tracks improvements and declines in the levels of democracy in governments. While Freedom House reports that 26 countries experienced overall declines in freedom while only 16 experienced gains, the report details trends in certain regions that are illustrative of "freedom's trajectory in 2012."

<p>According to the report, the Middle East and North Africa experienced intense civil strife, yet still managed to achieve significant gains. While Israel remains the only fully free country in the region, important improvements in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archives] were encouraging, with Freedom House improving them all to "Partly Free." Libya, labeled one of the most improved countries so soon after the recent <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">revolution</a> [JURIST Feature], came as the biggest surprise to Freedom House. On the other hand, countries like <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lebanon">Lebanon</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq">Iraq</a> [JURIST news archives] have reportedly experienced heavy declines in freedom over the last year and have been down graded to "Not Free."</p>

<p>Sub-Saharan Africa reportedly experienced some modest gains while also dealing with coups and civil strife. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ivory+coast">Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST news archive] has been upgraded to "Partly Free" from "Not Free" just one year removed from civil war. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guinea">Guinea</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=malawi">Malawi</a> [JURIST news archives] were also similarly upgraded. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sierra+Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, Lesotho and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=senegal">Senegal</a> [JURIST news archive] all improved to "Free" with Sierra Leone and Lesotho both holding free and fair elections. However, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">Mali</a> [JURIST news archive] dropped from "Free" to "Not Free" amid intense civil conflict. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href=/jurist_search.php?q=central+african+republic">Central African Republic</a>, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=the+gambia">Gambia</a> [JURIST news archives] and Guinea-Bassau all declined from "Partly Free" to "Not Free."</p>

<p>In Eurasia, the report suggests Russia's declines have pulled the region down as a whole. According to Freedom House, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">President Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive] has "ushered in a new period of accelerated repression" to the detriment of the region making it the least free region in the world. Specifically, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ukraine">Ukraine</a> declined for the second year in a row on account of it continuing to hold political prisoners, including former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yulia+Tymoshenko">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST news archives]. There was some improvement in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=georgia">Georgia</a> [JURIST news archive] through its first ever democratic transfer of power.</p>

<p>Asia also displayed mixed results. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar</a> [JURIST news archive] continued its gains through allowing the main opposition party to freely campaign for parliament. Even though it is still "Not Free," Freedom House says such actions are steps in the right direction. This has moved Myanmar passed China in terms of political and civil rights. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china">China</a> [JURIST news archives] also experienced modest gains in making improvements in the ability for citizens to challenge injustice. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maldives">Maldives</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST news archives] have both experienced notable declines. </p>

<p>The report focused on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Venezuela">Venezuela</a> [JURIST news archive] in the Americas region. While Chavez's opposition was allowed to freely campaign, the report claimed that the election process was far from fair. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=paraguay">Paraguay</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suriname">Suriname</a> [JURIST news archives] all experienced declines. Suriname, in particular, declined as a result of <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/suriname-lawmakers-pass-amnesty-bill-ending-presidents-trial.php">passing a law</a> [JURIST report] granting immunity to a former president on trial for murdering his opposition.</p>

<p>Finally, the report detailed trends in Western Europe and North America. Declines in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greece">Greece</a> [JURIST news archive] have largely come about as a result of economic hardships. These concerns have increased anti-immigration sentiment which has effected representation in the EU, thus bringing the region's rating down. The UK has been forced to deal with the fallout from the phone hacking scandal. US anti-terrorism policies have also been questioned, specifically the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drone+strikes">drone strikes</a> [JURIST news archives]. <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was also endorsed by President Barack Obama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, band member Maria Alekhina <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/01/16/russian-court-may-defer-pussy-riot-member-sentence">argued</a> [AP report] that separation from her child Fillip would cause psychological damage to the young boy, and that she should therefore be allowed to serve the remainder of her two-year prison sentence at a later date. Sentence deferrals are said to be uncommon in Russia, and this case was no exception. Judge Galina Yefremova rejected the rocker's petition, reasoning that the sentencing court had already taken the child's existence into account. Despite asking the court for a deferral, Alekhina refused to admit her guilt for her hooliganism and religious hatred convictions in connection with Pussy Riot's performance at an protest against Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">news archive</a>] at a Moscow cathedral on February 21 of last year.

<p>In October, Alekhina and band member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred to separate regional prisons</a> [JURIST report] generally reserved for dangerous criminals to serve their two-year sentences. Earlier in October, the band's third member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed on appeal</a> [JURIST report] because she did not actually participate in the protest song, and vowed to take the band's case to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on charges that the Russian government had illegally detained them and also violated the rock group's right to free speech. Samutsevich had previously asked for a delay in the proceedings after <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-delays-appeal-hearing-for-feminist-activists.php">firing the lawyer</a> [JURIST report] that had been representing the band as a whole. All three members were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Since the beginning of the trial, the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">the charges were politically motivated</a> [JURIST report] by Putin to discredit his opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision was based on information gathered through preliminary investigations and used to publish a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/icc0112/Documents/SASMaliArticle53_1PublicReportENG16Jan2013.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on the current situation in Mali. Bensouda claims there is sufficient evidence to believe war crimes including murder, mutilation, torture and rape have been committed in Mali. The investigation with focus primarily on the Northern regions of Mali where much of the violence has taken place. Even though violence is still ongoing, Bensouda emphasized the crucial role justice can play in the reconciliation process. 

<p>Violence in Mali has drawn much international attention for potential human rights abuses. Last week the interim president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. The prime minister of Mali, Cheick Modibo Diarra, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-prime-minister-of.php">forced to resign</a> [JURIST report] in December on state television after junta soldiers arrested him for attempting to leave the country in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis threatening the nation. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">recruiting child soldiers</a> [JURIST report].

The group, <a href="https://citizenlab.org/">Citizen Lab</a> [advocacy website], published its <a href="https://citizenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Planet-Blue-Coat.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools," which found that technology that can be used to track network users and censor offending content is being actively used on government or public networks and identified "11 ProxySG and 50 PacketShaper devices on public or government networks in countries with a history of concerns over human rights, surveillance, and censorship." ProxySG and PacketShaper are network technologies manufactured by <a href="http://www.bluecoat.com/">Blue Coat</a> [corporate website] which could be used for censorship or surveillance. According to the author of the report, the findings indicate a need for:<blockquote>[N]ational and international scrutiny of Blue Coat implementations in the countries we have identified, and a closer look at the global proliferation of "dual-use" information and communication technologies. Internet service providers responsible for these deployments should consider publicly clarifying their function, and we hope Blue Coat will take this report as an opportunity to explain their due diligence process to ensure that their devices are not used in ways that violate human rights.</blockquote>Citizen Lab also released an <a href="https://citizenlab.org/data/planetbluecoat_map/">interactive map</a> [materials] which details the types of devices discovered each nation.

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world. The UN Human Rights Council in July passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect the free speech</a> [JURIST report] of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. Last month China <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">adopted stricter rules</a> [JURIST report] on both internet providers and users. Last November Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] giving the nation the authority to completely block access to certain websites.

In deciding whether Samsung's tablets were so similar in design to Apple's iPad to constitute design infringement, the Dutch court relied on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">previous opinion from the UK</a> [JURIST report] which found that Samsung's designs contain noticeably distinguishable features on their front face, including a Samsung logo. Using the same reasoning, the district court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/16/us-apple-samsung-dutch-idUSBRE90F0ZN20130116">found</a> [Reuters report] that the features of each product were not similar enough to constitute infringement.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. Two weeks ago, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-denies-samsung-request-to-keep-sales-data-sealed.php">denied a Samsung request</a> [JURIST report] to keep sales data for some of its products sealed. Last month, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/apple-withdraws-patent-claim-against-samsung.php">revealed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to withdraw patent claims against Samsung in California over a new Samsung phone that the South Korea-based company said it was not offering for sale in the US market. In October, a different Dutch court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple software patent. Also in October, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">Apple appealed a ruling in Tokyo</a> [JURIST report] that dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed its patents. At the beginning of October the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">Federal Circuit reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus. In August, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">Apple won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The first, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1545.pdf">Arlington v. FCC</a> [transcript, PDF], addresses whether <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Chevron_U_S_A_Inc_v_Natural_Resources_Defense_Council_Inc_467_US_">Chevron USA v. NRDC</a> [opinion] allows a federal agency to determine its own jurisdiction. The provision at issue, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/332">47 USC &#167; 332(c)(7)</a> [text] of the Federal Communications Act, states that "nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government." However, &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires states or local authorities to act within a "reasonable" period of time. The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website], under its general jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, defined a "reasonable" period of time to be 90 days for some types of applications and 150 days for others. Failure of the state or local governments to act within the defined time periods allows affected individuals to bring an action in court or petition the FCC. Arlington argued that by establishing these time periods, the FCC was effectively limiting the power of state and local governments in violation of USC &#167; 332(c)(7)(A). The FCC argued that under <span class = "casename">Chevron</span> when the statute is ambiguous, the court simply must determine whether the agency's interpretation of the provision at issue is a permissible construction. The FCC argued that their interpretation was indeed reasonable, thus the FCC, as a government agency, should be given deference.

<p>The court also heard oral arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1118.pdf">Gunn v. Minton</a> [transcript, PDF], which addressed who should adjudicate a dispute arising out of patent law, which would require interpretation of patents but does not rule on the merit of the patent. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over any issue arising from a patent dispute. The particular case is a state law malpractice claim involving interpretation of federal patent law. Gunn argued that "arising under" jurisdiction requires that there be a significant federal issue embedded in the state law claim for a federal court to take jurisdiction. Gunn argued that although the experimental use exception of patent law was at issue in the state claim, the case did not require a court to interpret how the doctrine worked, how it is applied or what its parameters are. Therefore, there would be no actual federal law at issue since all that was required was for the court to make a hypothetical determination. Minton argued in response that the malpractice claim rested solely on an issue of patent law that is heard only in federal courts and that allowing a state court to adjudicate the case would "upset the balance between State and Federal judicial responsibility." Minton further argued that would be improper for a state court to rule on a patent issue which potentially could have issue preclusion effects in federal courts on an issue of federal law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senegal's national assembly adopted a law in December allowing Senegal to create a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/senegal-adopts-law-creating-special-tribunal-for-former-chad-dictator.php">special tribunal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website], which has already been offered financial support by Belgium. The trial is expected to start in early February. Habre's accusations include torture, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during his eight-year rule from 1982 to 1990. 

<p>Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in a bloody coup in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre, who has been been under house arrest there since 2005. In March lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium.

That month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay Habre's deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death in absentia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Most of the executive actions are intended to strengthen existing gun laws during what the president called an "epidemic of violence," while the other orders address issues of mental health and school safety. Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/16/remarks-president-and-vice-president-gun-violence">urged Congress</a> [remarks] to act to "make a real and lasting difference," calling on lawmakers to "require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun." Additionally, Obama urged Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds. "This time we must do something to protect our communities and our kids," the president said, referring to December's shooting in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut</a> [WSJ backgrounder].
"This is how we will be judged." 

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hyyWMoHOQPY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The 23 executive actions included a memorandum requiring federal agencies to make relevant <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/16/presidential-memorandum-improving-availability-relevant-executive-branch">data available to the federal background check system</a>, a memorandum requiring federal law enforcement to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/16/presidential-memorandum-tracing-firearms-connection-criminal-investigati">trace guns recovered in criminal investigations</a>, and a memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/16/presidential-memorandum-engaging-public-health-research-causes-and-preve">causes and prevention of gun violence</a> [text]. Before signing, Obama declared that the directives are intended to benefit "all the Americans who are counting on us to keep them safe from harm."</p>

<p>This story is the latest development in the Second Amendment and <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST comment] in the US.  Earlier this week New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation intended to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">impose tighter restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on gun and ammunition sales. In December the National Rifle Association (NRA) <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/nra-ceo-dismisses-renewal-of-ban-on-assault-weapons.php">restated its objection</a> [JURIST report] to reinvigorated calls for an assault weapons ban following the Newtown shooting. In July Florida Governor Rick Scott announced that his state would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-to-appeal-federal-court-ruling-striking-down-state-gun-law.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] ruling that struck down a Florida law that barred doctors from discussing the dangers of gun ownership with patients. In July 2010 the Chicago City Council unanimously approved a new gun control law that bans gun shops in the city and prohibits gun owners from stepping outside their homes, including porches and garages, with a handgun. Shortly thereafter a group of Chicago citizens, supported by both the NRA and the National Association of Firearm Retailers, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit against the city</a> [JURIST report] claiming the new ordinance infringes on their constitutional rights. In June 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZO.html">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government, thereby overturning Chicago's ban on handguns and raising considerable uncertainty about what amount of regulations of firearms was permissible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/123863p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that members of the media do not have the right to report from, or take photos or video within, Pennsylvania polling places. While <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/">PG Publishing Company</a> (PG) [corporate website], the appellant in the case, argued that a portion of the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/25/25.HTM">Pennsylvania Election Code</a> [text] that limits access to polling places "infringes on the media's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">backgrounder</a>] right to gather news," the circuit court disagreed, reasoning that the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html">US Constitution</a> [text] does not provide rights to the press broader than those covering the population at large. Said the court:<blockquote>Appellants are ... correct in arguing that the First Amendment encompasses  a right of access for newsgathering purposes. However, we decline to hold ... that the press is entitled to any greater protection under this right than is the general public. The Supreme Court's pronouncement on this issue is unequivocal. ... Thus, while the First Amendment does protect Appellant's right of access to gather news, that right does not extend to all information.</blockquote>The three-judge panel further opined that although the process of American voting began as a "public affair," history shows a "long-standing trend away from openness, toward a closed electoral process." The court also recognized the possibility that the presence of reporters inside polling places "could concern, intimidate or even turn away potential voters." While the law does not allow anyone except election officials, registered poll watchers and voters within 10 feet of polling places, PG also unsuccessfully argued that this rule is "unevenly enforced," and plans to appeal to the US <a href="www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>In 2008 the <a href="www.mnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news-media-can-conduct-exit-polling-in-minn">granted a request</a> [AP report] by news organizations to block a state law that would have kept exit pollsters at least 100 feet away from polling places on Election Day. Brought by several AP members, the suit <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/news-organizations-sue-minnesota-to.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that the law, titled "Lingering near polling place," violated their First Amendment rights to report and gather news. Similarly, in 2006, the <a href="www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/federal-judge-strikes-down-florida.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a state law prohibiting exit polling within 100 feet of a voting place on grounds that it violated free speech and freedom of the press. Members of the AP were also responsible for filing that lawsuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief of the National Accountability Bureau, Fasih Bokhari, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistanis-protest-killing-of-15-villagers-in-northwest-display-bodies-of-raid-victims/2013/01/17/06f709c8-6064-11e2-bc4f-1f06fffb7acf_story.html">argued</a> [WP report] that there was insufficient evidence against Ashraf to arrest him for allegations of accepting bribes for approving power generation projects during his tenure as Minister for Water and Power. He also noted that additional time was needed for further investigation. In response, the country's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] questioned Bokhari's motive behind the argument given that the case was initiated a year ago. The court demanded later Thursday that Bokhari produce the case files to determine whether the evidence is in fact insufficient, but Bokhari claimed that would be impossible due to the short notice. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-arrest-of-prime-minister.php">arrest order was issued</a> [JURIST report] by the country's Supreme Court on Tuesday.

<p>Ashraf's brief term as Prime Minister has been fraught with conflict and tension between the executive and the judiciary. Ashraf's predecessor, Yousuf Raza Gilani, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">forced out</a> as prime minister last June after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">convicted him of contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president. In July, only a month after Ashraf became prime minister, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-high-court-orders-new-pm-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">ordered him to reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] within three weeks. The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-shield-pm-from-contempt-proceedings.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to shield senior officials from contempt of court proceedings, which was widely seen as an attempt to exempt Ashraf from possible claims of contempt for failing to follow the order. When Ashraf did not do as the court requested, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-high-court-postpones-order-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">granted him</a> [JURIST report] another two weeks to comply with its order. When in early August Ashraf still did not reopen the investigation, the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-orders-to-explain-refusal-to-reopen-case-against-president.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] him to appear and explain his refusal to comply with the July orders. After his appearance in court, the Supreme Court then <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-grants-pm-additional-time-to-reopen-presidential-corruption-case.php">granted Ashraf an additional three weeks</a> [JURIST report] to reopen the corruption case. Finally, in mid-September, Ashraf agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pakistan-pm-to-allow-switzerland-to-reopen-corruption-charges-against-president.php">allow the corruption case to be reopened</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Alabama is appealing a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] issued last August by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] which <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/201114535.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] several provisions of both Alabama's HB 56 as well as a recent Georgia <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 87 text]. The petition for <em>certiorari</em> only asks the court to consider the constitutionality of a provision regarding the harboring or transporting of illegal immigrants without mention of other vacated provisions, including one which required public schools to check the immigration status of students and another which made it a crime for undocumented immigrants to solicit work. The <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website], which represented many of the plaintiffs in the suit contesting HB 56, <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-alabama-makes-costly-decision-to-continue-defending-anti-immigrant-law">responded to the news</a> [statement] saying they are "deeply disappointed by the state's continued efforts to defend this immoral and reprehensible anti-immigrant law."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">lifted</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-blocks-georgia-immigration-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST reports] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. In November a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/index.asp">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-upholds-motorist-provision-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] part of South Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">immigration law</a> [SB 20 materials] that permits law enforcement officials to detain motorists on the side of the road for a "reasonable amount of time" while the officer checks the driver's immigration status. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in September denied a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier this month the ICC asked Libyan officials to address reports that they plan to try Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profile], the former intelligence chief for Gaddafi. Libya has <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/libya-denies-request-to-hand-over-gaddafis-son-to-icc--dnp.php">refused</a> to hand the two men over to the ICC and <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/libya-to-try-gaddafi-son-intelligence-chief-within-next-month.php">announced plans to try them</a> [JURIST reports] in Libya. In October Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to allow them to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. In August Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly. In June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam, including Melinda Taylor, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] by Libyan security forces and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manning has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-soldier-formally-charged-for-leaking-information-to-wikileaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with 22 counts under the Espionage Act, including aiding the enemy, and could face life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/bradley-manning-judge-prosecutors-must-prove-he-knew-he-was-aiding-the-enemy/2013/01/16/934a8568-6018-11e2-a389-ee565c81c565_story.html">introduce evidence</a> [WP report] recovered from the compound of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bin+laden">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive] to establish that he received some of the documents Manning provided to WikiLeaks. Lind <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MANNING_WIKILEAKS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">ruled</a> [AP report] that Manning may introduce evidence of his motive only to the extent that it shows he was unaware that providing information to WikiLeaks was tantamount to dealing with the enemy. Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, also argued in court on Wednesday that Manning's right to a speedy trial has been violated.

<p>Since his arrest in 2010 Manning's case has been controversial with his <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/world/bradley-manning-update/index.html">supporters protesting</a> [CNN report] the effort to prosecute him and calling him a <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/manning1/petition.html">courageous whistle-blower</a> [advocacy petition]. Just last week, Lind <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the pre-trial punishment of Manning, which included extended solitary confinement and use of suicide restraints, was illegal and excessive. In November Manning's partial guilty plea offer was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] by Lind. In June Manning's motion to dismiss the charges against him was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied</a> after Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">declared competent</a> [JURIST reports] to stand trial in April.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tsvangirai previously stated that the passage of the constitution was a condition for the conduction of elections scheduled for later this year. According to Mugabe, he will announce in the next few weeks when a <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/zimbabwe-parties-mugabe-tsvangirai-draft-constitution/1585904.html">referendum will be held</a> [VOA report] to approve the new constitution.

In November the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/+-Defenseurs-des-droits-humains-+?lang=en">Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders</a> (OBS) [FIDH backgrounder] released a report finding that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/zimbabwe-rights-defenders-facing-harassment-report.php">human rights defenders in Zimbabwe continue to be harassed</a> [JURIST report].

Sotoudeh left prison in Tehran for three days and was greeted Thursday by her husband and two children. Sotoudeh is serving six years in prison for her September 2010 arrest and conviction for propaganda and harming national security. Sotoudeh <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/17/lawyer-nasrin-sotoudeh-freed">angered authorities</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] by representing political activists and highlighting the execution of juveniles in the country.

Many activists and and campaigners believe that the charges against Sotoudeh are false and merely reflect the authorities's objection to Sotoudeh's internationally recognized human rights activism. 

<p>In December Sotoudeh ended a 49-day <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/iran-human-rights-lawyer-ends-hunger-strike.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in protest of her prison conditions and a travel ban imposed on her family. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay had expressed concern for Sotoudeh's deteriorating health and urged the Iranian government to lift the travel ban, saying the ban was not justified by international law. After judicial authorities agreed to lift the travel ban on Sotoudeh's daughter, Sotoudeh ended her strike. Sotoudeh was sentenced in January 2011 to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit is <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/turkmen-v.-ashcroft">Turkmen v. Ashcroft</a> [CCR backgrounder]. The court dismissed the suit against former <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] officials John Ashcroft, Robert Mueller and James Zigler, noting that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently state a claim that the officials had incurred any supervisory liability. However, the ruling does permit further proceedings against wardens and detention officials from the <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bro/index.jsp">Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn</a> [official website] based on the treatment the men received after they were detained, including preventing their contact with families and video-taping conversations with lawyers. The plaintiffs in the case have been represented by the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website].

<p>The <span class="casename">Turkmen</span> case has been winding its way through the federal court system for years.

In November 2009, five men who claimed they were similarly illegally detained reached a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-settles-with-post-911.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the US government for $1.26 million. In 2007, a district court judge granted the government's <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/Turkmen_Defs%27BriefOmnibusMotiontoDismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> [text, PDF] a number of the claims, but refused to dismiss the abuse claims. Also in 2007, the government <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/brooklyn-prison-guards-named-in-911.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] several guards at the <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bro/index.jsp">Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn</a> official website], the location in which men were detained, with abusing prisoners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://portal.iuoelocal150.org/News%20Room/Local%20150%20News/Pages/default.aspx">International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/indiana-union-members-sue-to-block-right-to-work-legislation.php">filed the suit</a> [JURIST report] last February arguing that the right-to-work law violates unions' free speech rights under the US and Indiana constitutions by hampering collection of money to pay for unions' political speech. Chief District Judge Philip Simon <a href="http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/0bfebdbf9d85473daa131e6fc5544646/IN--Indiana-Right-To-Work-Lawsuit">rejected the union's challenge</a> [AP report], saying that the state's interest in creating a business-friendly environment is a legitimate reason for passing the law. The union is considering appealing the district court's decision to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website]. 

<p>Many states have had contentious disputes over collective bargaining rights recently. In December Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-lawmakers-approve-freedom-to-work-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] known as "Freedom to Work" that makes payment of union dues voluntary and limits workers' ability to strike. In September the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">was defeated 57-43 percent</a> [AP report]. Wisconsin faced a challenge against its legislation which limited the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. In July the Wisconsin Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] not to reopen a case challenging the state's <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/jr1_sb11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [text, PDF] because of a justice's refusal to recuse himself. Four votes were needed, but only three justices were in support of reopening the case. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the bill in June 2011 thereby overruling the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier that legislators had violated the "open meetings" rule. The court ruled that the lower court had "invaded the legislature's constitutional powers." In March a judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federaljudge-strikes-down-parts-of-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">ruled unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] certain provisions of the Budget Repair Bill reasoning that unions which supported <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] during his election were apparently given preferential treatment. In November 2011 Ohio voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-voters-reject-collective-bargaining-law-in-statewide-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bill which would have impacted Ohio's 400,000 public workers by limiting their ability to strike and collectively bargain for health insurance and pensions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Muhafda, the acting deputy head of the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights</a> (BCHR) [advocacy website], was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-extends-detention-of-leading-human-rights-activist.php">arrested in November</a> [JURIST report] during an unauthorized protest. After being released without charge, Al-Muhafda was arrested again in December during a clash between protesters and the government in Manama, Bahrain's capital. In its press release, AI declared that Al-Muhafda was likely arrested because of his advocacy for human rights and proclaimed that he has freedom of expression rights under international law that Bahrain's government must not violate:<blockquote>The 1998 UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders expressly reaffirms the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), by which human rights defenders have the right to freely publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and to draw public attention to their observance, both in law and in practice.</blockquote>Al-Muhafda is scheduled to appear in court on January 29 when witnesses are expected to testify.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a> [JURIST news archive] has faced international scrutiny recently regarding its treatment of political prisoners. Last week the highest Bahraini appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-high-court-rejects-appeals-of-13-imprisoned-rights-activists.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 13 prominent pro-democracy protestors convicted by military tribunal in 2011 on charges of plotting to overthrow the monarchy. In December Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php">commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protesters, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment. Earlier in December the prison sentence for outspoken Bahraini rights activist Nabeel Rajab was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-court-cuts-prison-sentence-for-activist-nabeel-rajab.php">reduced by one year</a> [JURIST report]. In November AI <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-continuing-rights-abuses-despite-pledge-to-reform-ai.php">released a brief</a> [JURIST report] detailing how Bahrain had failed to meet its obligations and promises to ensure respect for human rights and prevent further torture within the country. In October the Bahrain appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-upholds-convictions-against-two-teachers-for-organizing-strike-efforts.php">upheld verdicts against two teachers</a> [JURIST report] for organizing a teacher's strike to support anti-government protests.

HRW is calling on the government of Myanmar to grant humanitarian agencies access to tens of thousands of ethnic Kachins displaced by the fighting. "Burmese President Thein Sein needs to order his army commanders to respect the laws of war and end unlawful attacks on civilians," said Phil Robertson, HRW's deputy Asia director. "Both the Burmese army and the [Kachin Independence Army (KIA)] should take all necessary precautions to keep the tens of thousands of civilians in and around Laiza from harm's way."

KIA is the military branch of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), which seeks to govern Kachin and obtain the rights and autonomy afforded to it in the <a href="http://www.encburma.net/index.php/agreements/43-agreements/159-the-panglong-agreement.html">1947 Pagalong Agreement</a> [text]. 

<p>In recent months Myanmar has taken steps to reform its human rights records but has also faced criticism for not doing enough. Earlier this week Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/myanmar-repeals-junta-law-for-sentencing-dissidents.php">repealed a law</a> [JURIST report] that was used by the nation's military junta to impose long prison sentences on dissidents. The law banned protests against the national convention and allowed for prison sentences of up to 20 years for writing or delivering <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/16/burma-repeals-law-jail-dissidents">speeches that pose a threat</a> [AP report] to Myanmar's peace and stability. Also this week HRW [advocacy website] called on authorities in Myanmar to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-to-myanmar-drop-charges-against-activists.php">drop criminal charges against nine peaceful protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were demonstrating without a permit in Rangoon in September on International Peace Day.

Myanmar officials in September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/myanmar-announces-amnesty-for-514-prisoners.php">announced amnesty for 514 prisoners</a> [JURIST report], identified by activists to be several political detainees and foreigners.

Defense counsel for accused <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] conspirators, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive], filed a motion requesting that the court find that the US constitution was "presumed to apply" in the proceedings, and that the prosecution must bear the burden of proving that any particular provision did not apply. Colonel James Pohl <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/557200/sept-11-constitution-ruling.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that the request presented a nonjusticiable issue because the Commission cannot rule on hypothetical legal questions that do not aver "real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief" relating to actual historical fact. In a separate case, counsel for accused USS Cole bomber, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] filed a motion to dismiss alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> [text, PDF] in August 2012 on grounds that the bombing occurred "prior to the commencement of hostilities" between the US and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Pohl <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/557201/cole-armed-conflict-ruling.pdf">denied the motion</a> [order, PDF] and found that US political branches have made determinations that such hostilities did exist prior to 9/11 and that these determinations are owed judicial deference to the extent that they present questions of law. However, the factual burden required to prove whether or not hostilities coincided with the USS Cole bombing is to remain with the prosecution. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty for all five accused 9/11 conspirators, and alleged USS Cole bomber, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.

<p>Controversy continues to surround Guantanamo military trials. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-affirms-denial-of-habeas-petition-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed the denial of a <em>habeas</em> petition</a> [JURIST report] for a Guantanamo detainee. Earlier that month a US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-military-judge-upholds-request-to-censor-911-conspirators-testimony.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a request to censor 9/11 conspirators' testimony. In September a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on lawyers representing Guantanamo Bay detainees who have had their <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges denied or dismissed. The Department of Defense announced in 2011 that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/military-prosecutors-bring-charges-against-911-suspects.php">sworn charges against the five men</a> [JURIST report] accused in the 9/11 attacks. In April 2011 US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four others would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military commission</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration abandoned attempts to have the 9/11 suspects tried in civilian courts. Controversy has also surrounded the USS Cole trial. In October, al-Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/accused-uss-cole-bomber-boycotts-pretrial-hearing.php">boycotted his pretrial hearing</a> [JURIST report] at the Guantanamo Bay facility. In September Military Judge James Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/military-judge-denies-motion-to-allow-television-broadcast-of-guantanamo-bay-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that he did not have the authority to allow media to broadcast al-Nashiri's trial. In February Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/chief-guantanamo-judge-protects-confidentiality-of-attorney-client-mail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in al-Nashiri's case that attorney-client mail that was inspected at Guantanamo Bay can not be released by the Pentagon. Days before that ruling defense lawyers in the case of another Guantanamo detainee <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lawyer-for-911-suspect-challenges-government-review-of-legal-correspondence.php">filed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the order for officials to read all legal correspondence for suspected 9/11 conspirators.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Berlusconi was <a href="http://www.ansa.it/documents/1351272200220_MOTIVAZIONI-MEDIASET.pdf">found guilty</a> [judgement, PDF, in Italian] and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in October on charges of tax fraud for irregularities regarding the purchase of broadcasting rights by his private company <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian]. Berlusconi's lawyers proposed a suspension due to the fact that as a known political party chairman, Berlusconi is engaged with the campaign election. Judges stated the request was generic and the appeal process will <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130118/italy-court-rejects-berlusconi-bid-halt-tax-fraud-trial">not affect the campaign</a> [Reuters report] nor present an impediment to his appearing in court. Berlusconi was sentenced to a one-year prison term, banned from political office and ordered to pay 10 million euro in damages. However, his sentence will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215">not take effect</a> [BBC news report] until all of his appeals are exhausted. Two other trials for additional charges are also pending for Berlusconi. 

<p>In addition to the tax fraud trial, the former prime minister, who stepped down last November, also faces charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports]. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of an immunity law backed by Berlusconi granting public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while in office. Despite numerous trials, Berlusconi has never served prison time due to successful appeals or cases running past the statute of limitations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, violations also include stoning, amputation, the recruitment of child soldiers, and forced marriage and gang rape of girls as young as 12. The current situation, says spokesperson Rupert Colville, "is linked to long-standing and unresolved issues" taking place within the country. The OHCHR report called on "all parties to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law standards," asking for the "initiation of a reconciliation process to address current human rights challenges as well as long-standing unresolved issues," and urging the Malian army and its supporters "to take extreme care not to carry out further reprisals as and when they retake territory in the North."

<p>Violence in Mali has drawn much international attention for potential human rights abuses. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced earlier this week that her office has officially <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed in Mali. Last week the interim president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. The prime minister of Mali, Cheick Modibo Diarra, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-prime-minister-of.php">forced to resign</a> [JURIST report] in December on state television after junta soldiers arrested him for attempting to leave the country in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis threatening the nation. In September, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">recruiting child soldiers</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems.

Act 10 was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> into law by Wisconsin <a href="http://www.scottwalker.org/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] in March 2011. Wisconsin's largest teachers' union, public sector union and five other unions challenged the law's constitutionality, claiming that Act 10 violated equal protection based on an irrational division of unions into two categories. Last March the district court had <a href="http://werc.wi.gov/DOAroot/courtDecisionWEACvWalker04-27-12.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] the portion of the law requiring yearly unions elections and said that the budget repair bill illegally prohibited automatic withdrawal of union dues from paychecks. The Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57564802/appeals-judge-upholds-wis-law-stripping-collective-bargaining-rights/">reversed the district court's ruling</a> [AP report] and declared the entire law constitutional. Judge Hamilton partially dissented, stating that he would not have upheld the selective prohibition on payroll deductions for dues for a selective group of public employee unions.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill has been the subject of legal and political controversy since its passage. The <a href="http://www.wlea.org/">Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association</a> (WLEA) [union website] in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/union-files-lawsuit-challenging-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> in the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] challenging its constitutionality specifically as it pertains to law enforcement unions on the grounds that it violates their associational, speech, petition, advocacy and equal protection rights. A Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-controversial-collective-bargaining-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law as it applies to school district and local government workers in September. Wisconsin <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-ag-appeals-ruling-striking-down-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] days later. In July the <a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused to reopen a case challenging the Budget Repair Bill because of a justice's <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">refusal to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upholding</a> of Act 10 in June 2011 overturned a Dane County Circuit Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] that struck down the law for violations of the open meetings rule. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Amos expressed <a href="http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/ERC%20Key%20Messages%20on%20Syria%20Issue%209.pdf">particular concern</a> [press release, PDF] for the vicious nature of the violence, the increased sexual violence and Syria's harsh winter. Four million people in Syria require assistance, and half of those have been internally displaced. The winter and ubiquitous violence are leaving thousands of people living in tents and lacking adequate access to food, medical equipment or services. Amos stated that response efforts are unable to reach millions of individuals due to lack of access and reduced funding. Pillay expressed concern over the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">death toll reaching 60,000</a> [JURIST report], stating, "The figures speak for themselves. Sixty thousand is not a figure that should be treated lightly." Both the Syrian government and the opposition forces have reportedly committed human rights violations. 

<p>The Syrian government has been engaged in a bloody conflict with numerous <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15798218">opposition groups</a> [BBC backgrounder] since March 2011 when nationwide protests opposing the government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=bashar+assad">news archive</a>] began. More than 50 countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] on Monday to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The revolt against Assad has lasted 21 months and began with protests that quickly turned into violence between Assad's forces and demonstrators. A study carried out by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported that the average number of deaths per month has increased from the summer of 2011, where the monthly average was approximately 1,000, to July 2012, where the monthly average was 5,000 deaths. In October Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world powers to work toward ending the suffering in Syria, emphasizing uniformity and cooperation among leaders to quell the violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

After being considered in conference eight times, the court granted <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-158-2012-08-01-Bond-Cert-Pet-Final.pdf">Bond v. United States</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-158.htm">docket</a>] and will determine whether Carol Anne Bond can be tried under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/229">Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 229 text], a federal law that enforces the international <a href = "http://www.un.org/disarmament/WMD/Chemical/">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> [materials], which intends to ban the spread of international chemical weapons. Bond attempted to poison her husband's lover using highly toxic chemicals&#8212;<A href = "http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=17865">10-chlorophenoxarsine</a> and <a href = "http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=24502">potassium dichromate</a> [NIH backgrounders]&#8212;by applying the poisons to her nemesis' mailbox, car door handles, and house doorknob. She was then convicted under the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of acquiring, transferring, receiving, retaining, or possessing a chemical weapon. Two terms ago, the court ruled that Bond had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-individual-may-challenge-federal-law-for-violating-states-rights.php">standing</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text] to challenge the application of the treaty against her, but did not determine the merits of her claim. This time, the court will consider if Congress has the authority to intrude on local and state programs with an international treaty in order to continue complete compliance with the treaty. The court will also look at if the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act "can be interpreted not to reach ordinary poisoning cases, which have been adequately handled by state and local authorities" in light of the court's decision in <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8930976133950292975&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Missouri v. Holland</a> [opinion]. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Bond_681_F3d_149_3d_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">upheld the conviction</a> [opinion] stating, "because the Convention is an international agreement with a subject matter that lies at the core of the Treaty Power and because <span class = "casename">Holland</span> instructs that 'there can be no dispute about the validity of [a] statute' that implements a valid treaty, we will affirm Bond's conviction."

<p>The court consolidated three cases in order to rule on the legal remedies available for the victims of convicted financier  <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Allen+Stanford">Allen Stanford</a> [JURIST news archive], who is currently serving a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/financier-stanford-sentenced-to-110-years-for-ponzi-scheme.php">110-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for committing a $7 billion <a href = "http://www.sec.gov/answers/ponzi.htm">Ponzi scheme</a> [SEC backgrounder]. The court will consider if the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ353/pdf/PLAW-105publ353.pdf">Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998</a> (SLUSA) [text, PDF] precludes the various plaintiffs from pursuing class action lawsuits under state laws against investment firms that encouraged them to invest with Stanford. The cases granted are <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-79.htm">Chadbourne &#38; Parke v. Troice</a>, <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-86.htm">Willis of Colorado v. Troice</a> and <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-88.htm">Proskauer Rose LLP v. Troice</a> [dockets].</p>

<p>In <A href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-484-2012-10-17-UTSW-v-Nassar-Cert-Petition.pdf">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-484.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider whether the retaliation provision of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [42 USC &#167; 2000e-2(a) text] requires a plaintiff to prove <a href = "http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/But+for+causation">but-for causation</a> [backgrounder] or instead requires only proof that the employer had a <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mixed-motive_instruction">mixed motive</a> [LII backgrounder]. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=674+F.3d+448&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=5745800104305313797&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] initially that the jury had found sufficient evidence for Dr. Naiel Nassar's retaliation claim, but not his constructive discharge claim. The <A href = "http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</a> [official website] then appealed <em>en banc</em> on the "mixed motive" question, which a divided court <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Nassar_v_University_of_Texas_Southwestern_Medical_Ctr_688_F3d_211">declined to hear</a> [opinion].</p>

<p>Finally, the court will hear <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-547-Lancaster-cert-petition.pdf">Metrish v. Lancaster</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-547.htm">docket</a>], which concerns if it was an "unexpected and indefensible" change in a common-law doctrine of criminal law and thus a violation of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process rights</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] when the Michigan Supreme Court recognized a state statute that abolished the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity">diminished capacity defense</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and when the Michigan Court of Appeals applied it retroactively. Burt Lancaster was convicted in 1994 for first-degree murder, where he pleaded a defense of diminished capacity. That verdict was overturned due to a jury selection error, but when Lancaster was retried in 2005, he was not allowed to utilize diminished capacity as a defense. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <A href = "http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1604941.html">ruled</a> [opinion text] for Lancaster, stating "[p]reventing a defendant from presenting his only viable defense at trial is so prejudicial that holding the violation harmless would suggest that almost no constitutional violation would warrant reversal." The court is being asked to consider the case in light of <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=rogers+v.+tennessee&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=4098197461881822332&scilh=0">Rogers v. Tennessee </a> and <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Harrington+v.+Richter&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=12425981498832779110&scilh=0">Harrington v.

Pshonka alleges that Tymoshenko and former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lazarenko">Pavlo Lazarenko</a> [JURIST news archive] ordered the murder of Shcherban, who was shot to death in an airport in 1996. Tymoshenko has previously claimed that the prosecution is <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_30_05_2012_04">"looking for a scapegoat"</a> [press release], and her lawyers have accused the prosecution of <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_11_05_2012_03">fabricating charges</a> [press release] to keep Tymoshenko imprisoned. Tymoshenko has already been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison on corruption charges and is currently awaiting trial for <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ukraine-ex-pm-on-trial-for-tax-evasion.php">charges of tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. That trial has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">postponed multiple times</a> since it began in April.

<p>The trials against the former Ukrainian prime minister have sparked international criticism. In September the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">unanimously passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.RES.466:">resolution</a> [text] calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. It condemned current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] for his role in the allegedly politically motivated imprisonment. In August the <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Ukrainian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">upheld Tymoshenko's abuse of office conviction</a> [JURIST report]. During the appeal the government denied allegations that the criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko were a measure initiated by Yanukovich to prevent her from participating in the October elections. The decision came only a day after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Tymoshenko's appeal. Also in August Ukrainian prosecutors urged the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-prosecutors-urge-court-not-to-hear-tymoshenko-appeal.php">not to hear her appeal</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors told the court that Tymoshenko's trial had already established her guilt in the case, and asked the judges maintain her <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">seven-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] in the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/19/kansas-abortion-law_n_2510767.html">withdrawal</a> [Huffington Post report] follows a <a href="https://ecf.ksd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2011cv2462-70">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] that the ACLU failed to prove that the legislature's primary motivation in passing the law was to make it more difficult to get an abortion. The holding prohibits the ACLU from raising the claims again or appealing the judge's earlier ruling. The court also ruled that the case would <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-orders-trial-for-kansas-abortion-law-challenge.php">go forward to trial</a> [JURIST report], but the parties agreed to dismiss all remaining claims, ending the case.

<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">filed by the ACLU</a> [JURIST report] in 2011. In September of that year the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">denied the ACLU's request for an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to halt enforcement of the law while the litigation proceeds. <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] signed HB 2075 into law in May 2011, one month after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed two other pieces of legislation</a> [JURIST report] restricting abortions in the state, specifically the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF], which requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF], which restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the controversial belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hathaway was already set to resign on Monday, and she has been off the bench since she announced her <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130107/NEWS06/130107049/Judicial-Tenure-Commission-Michigan-Supreme-Court-Justice-Diane-Hathaway-suspension">decision to resign</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report] on January 7 following a complaint filed by the <a href="http://jtc.courts.mi.gov/">Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission</a> [official website] for violation of judicial conduct rules. The charges filed on Friday were filed as a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/michigan-supreme-court-judge-charged-with-fraud.html">criminal "information"</a> [AP report], and a guilty plea is expected. Hathaway and her husband are accused of deeding their home in Florida to a relative while negotiating a short sale on the Grosse Pointe home they could not afford, resulting in a $600,000 debt they owed to their bank being erased. Once this happened, their names went back on the house in Florida. The bank fraud charge against Hathaway alleges that she made false statements to the bank, fraudulently transferred property to others and failed to disclose available cash. The allegations stem from an <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/did-michigan-supreme-court-justice-play-a-shell-game-to-get-out-from-underwater-home">investigative news report</a> [WXYZ report] by Detroit's <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/">WXYZ Channel 7 Action News</a> [official website] in May which revealed evidence of the transaction to the public.

<p>Judicial corruption has been an important and controversial issue world-wide in recent years. In October the UN called on nations around the world to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">combat judicial corruption</a> [JURIST report], stating that it is a human rights issue because it can deprive people of their due process rights. It also said keeping the judiciary free from corruption is critical to "strengthen judicial credibility and independence." In 2010 the <a href="http://www.worldjusticeproject.org/">World Justice Project</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-releases-inaugural-rule-of-law-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] ranking countries by their adherence to rule of law, which used factors such as level of corruption, rights and access to judicial remedies. The results of the report showed a trend that rule of law was lacking more in poorer countries than it was in countries with stronger economies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The treaty, named the Minamata Convention on Mercury for a city in Japan that has incurred serious damage as a result of mercury, will regulate and control any products and processes that involve the use of mercury. Examples of products and processes that will be regulated are medical equipment, light bulbs, mining, cement and coal-powered sectors. Some products, such as thermometers and blood pressure devices containing mercury, are scheduled to be phased out by 2020. <a href="http://www.unep.org/">UN Environmental Programme</a> (UNEP) [official website] Executive Director Achim Steiner was pleased with the agreement, saying <blockquote>Everyone in the world stands to benefit from the decisions taken this week in Geneva, in particular the workers and families of small-scale gold miners, the peoples of the Arctic and this generation of mothers and babies and the generations to come. I look forward to swift ratification of the Minamata Convention so that it comes into force as soon as possible.</blockquote>The treaty has been in the works for four years and will be available for signature in October at a special UN meeting in Japan.

<p>The adverse effects of mercury on health and the environment have been a growing concern in recent years. Earlier this month, UNEP released its annual <a href="http://www.unep.org/PDF/PressReleases/REPORT_Layout11.pdf">Global Mercury Assessment</a> [text, PDF], which gave the most recent information on global mercury emissions and its effects on health and the environment. The report showed an increase in emissions in the industrial sector since 2005. Last year <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report showing that children working in Mali mines were suffering from <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mali-gold-mining-industry-violating-child-labor-laws-hrw.php">severe health issues</a> [JURIST report] due to inhalation of mercury. In 2008 two US federal courts ruled on issues involving mercury and its health effects on consumers and the environment. In one, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">US Food and Drug Association</a> [official website] regulations did not preempt a woman from suing a tuna company for injuries sustained from mercury that was in a can of tuna she ate. In the other case, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-epa-power.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a "cap-and-trade" policy that would have allowed power plants to trade "credits" for mercury emission was invalid.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW said that Mali's army has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/19/human-rights-watch-mali-army-killing-civilians_n_2511680.html">targeting ethnic groups</a> [Reuters report] associated with rebels in the north, particularly Tuaregs and Arabs. HRW called on Mali's government, as well as France and West African nations to ensure that civilians are protected from violence. During the ongoing fighting between the Malian government and Islamist rebels, HRW has accused both sides of committing human rights violations, and urged rebel groups earlier this week to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/15/mali-islamists-should-free-child-soldiers">release all child soldiers</a> [press release].

<p>Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently regarding political violence and alleged human rights abuses. On Friday the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] issued a report saying that the tumultuous situation in Mali has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-mali-turmoil-has-led-to-human-rights-violations.php">led to human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced earlier this week that her office has officially <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed in Mali. Last week the interim president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. The prime minister of Mali, Cheick Modibo Diarra, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-prime-minister-of.php">forced to resign</a> [JURIST report] in December on state television after junta soldiers arrested him for attempting to leave the country in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis threatening the nation. In September HRW reported that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">recruiting child soldiers</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems. In August officials from the ICC were in Mali <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-investigating-allegations-of-war-crimes-in-mali.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] whether the same two Islamic groups had committed war crimes in Mali.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief Guantanamo prosecutor, Brigadier General <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14598">Mark Martins</a> asked the DOD's appointee, Retired Admiral <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=13405">Bruce MacDonald</a> [DOD backgrounders] to dismiss the prosecution charge in order to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/18/us-usa-guantanamo-idUSBRE90H19G20130118">avoid uncertainty that could delay the case</a> [Reuters report]. In the press release, the DOD declared that it would refuse to drop the conspiracy charge because it was waiting for appellate courts to determine whether military commissions can recognize conspiracy as valid charge:<blockquote>[D]ismissal at this time would be premature, as the viability of conspiracy as a chargeable offense in trials by military commission is still pending appellate review. ... Congress included conspiracy as a chargeable offense in the Military Commissions Acts of 2006 and 2009, and that two Presidents had signed those Acts into law.</blockquote>In addition to conspiracy, the DOD has charged the five accused plotters with terrorism, murder, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, destruction of property, hijacking aircraft and intentionally causing serious bodily injury. 

<p>Earlier this week the chief US military judge at Guantanamo <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-judge-denies-defense-motions-in-911-uss-cole-trials.php">denied defense motions</a> [JURIST report] filed in both the 9/11 military commission trial and the 2000 <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/usscole/cole-index.htm">USS Cole</a> [Navy backgrounder] bombing trial.

The ICTB found Azad guilty <em>in absentia</em> of murder, rape, destruction of property, theft and of threatening witnesses to keep them from testifying against him. Azad, a former leader of the Islamist party <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [official website; <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">GlobalSecurity backgrounder</a>], is said to have collaborated with Pakistani forces in the murder of Hindus during the war before fleeing to Pakistan to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-issues-arrest-warrant-for-islamist-leader.php">avoid charges</a> [JURIST report]. However, the party as a whole has denied allegations that it collaborated with Pakistan, and has asserted that the current government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/21/us-bangladesh-trial-idUSBRE90K0AT20130121">fabricated war crimes</a> [Reuters report] to leverage political power. Azad's sentence is the first to be handed down by the ICTB, with 11 other defendants currently awaiting verdicts.

<p>Bangladeshi officials <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] in March 2010 to investigate and prosecute crimes committed in the Bangladesh Liberation War, during which officials estimate that Pakistani soldiers and local militia participated in more than three million killings and 200,000 rapes. Since then, the ICTB has been fraught with controversy and conflict.  Earlier this month, the second ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-rejects-retrial-plea-by-jamaat-e-islami-leader.php">rejected a plea for a re-trial</a> [JURIST report] from JI assistant Secretary General Abdul Quader Molla. The tribunal included three high court judges and six investigators retired from civilian, law enforcement and military careers, however Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-judge-resigns.php">resigned from his post</a> [JURIST report] in December. In June the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-rejects-bail-plea-for-jamaat-e-islami-leader.php">rejected a bail petition</a> [JURIST report] from JI leader and former Parliament member Delwar Hossain Sayeedee. In January 2012, the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bangladesh-opposition-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Ghulam Azam, 89, for alleged crimes against humanity. In November 2011 the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-begins-first-trial.php">began its first trial</a> [JURIST report] with the case against Delwar Hossain Sayedee. He is charged with 20 alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973</a> [text, PDF] including genocide, arson, rape and torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of many proceedings against Berlusconi, the in this case the ex-premier is <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with paying then 17-year-old dancer Karima "Ruby" El Mahroug for sex and abusing his power by asking police to release her after she was detained for an unrelated theft crime. Berlusconi, who denies all charges, welcomed this decision, having requested to have the trial suspended for fear of an adverse verdict in the middle of his campaign for a fifth term in office. Milan judges <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/14/us-italy-berlusconi-trial-idUSBRE90D0DX20130114">rejected</a> [Reuters report] the suspension requests last week and again on Monday.

<p>Berlusconi is currently a defendant in four trials. In addition to the sex accusations he faces charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">tax fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. Last week, a request to suspend his tax fraud appeal's trial was also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/italy-court-rejects-berlusconis-request-to-suspend-trial-until-after-election.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by Milan Judges. Despite numerous trials Berlusconi has never served prison time.

The criminal investigation against Serhiy Vlasenko <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/top-lawyer-for-jailed-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-faces-legal-action-fears-arrest/2013/01/21/4fb6a16c-63cc-11e2-889b-f23c246aa446_story.html">involves</a> [AP report] alleged car theft, robbery and failure to obey a court order. Vlasenko has denied all allegations and condemned the government's action as being politically motivated to deprive Tymoshenko of her defense, just three days after  <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/guidance_gpu.html">Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-charged-with-murder.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko with murder for her role in the contract-style killing of Yevhen Shcherban and two others in 1996. Vlasenko stated that the allegations were based on groundless facts because the car theft involved taking of his own car that his divorced wife claims to be hers while the robbery charge relates to taking of his ex-wife's cellphone to erase some video files of himself. Although Vlasenko is protected under the parliamentary immunity, he expects that such protection will be eliminated within the next three weeks, making him subject to arrest. If prosecuted for the allegations, he may face a prison term of seven years.

<p>Tymoshenko has already been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced to seven years</a> in prison on corruption charges and is currently awaiting trial for <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ukraine-ex-pm-on-trial-for-tax-evasion.php">charges of tax evasion</a> [JURIST reports]. That trial has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">postponed multiple times</a> [JURIST report] since it began in April. The trials against the former prime minister have sparked international criticism. In September the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. It condemned current Ukrainian President <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] for his role in the allegedly politically motivated imprisonment. In August the <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Ukrainian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko's abuse of office conviction. During the appeal the government denied allegations that the criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko were a measure initiated by Yanukovich to prevent her from participating in the October elections. The decision came only a day after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Tymoshenko's appeal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was brought by US and foreign victims and families of victims of terrorist attacks in Israel during the period between 1995 and 2004, who allege that the bank, which had branches in New York, provided financial support to terrorists during the period at issue. The plaintiffs demanded documents pertaining to the case, including bank accounts held by terrorist organizations and individuals affiliated with such groups. The bank has denied plaintiffs' requests, arguing that the documents were protected by foreign bank secrecy laws. The US <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] imposed a sanction pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_37">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37</a> [Cornall LII backgrounder] allowing the jury to infer that Arab Bank (1) provided financial services to terrorists and terrorist organizations and (2) did so knowingly and purposefully. Basing its reasoning on the three-prong test established in <span class='casename'>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.</span>, the appeals court determined that it cannot review the defendant's appeal. First, although the district court's sanction order is "conclusive," it is both "intertwined with the merits" of the case and is "effectively reviewable after final judgment." Second, the sanction was "inextricably intertwined with the merits of the action" because it directly affects the resolution of the merits of the case. Lastly, the jury verdict may be reversed if there is finding that the jury instruction in fact had prejudicial effect on the defendant. Thus, there would be an effective remedy available for the defendant. In addition, the court held that the bank is not entitled to a writ of mandamus because it failed to prove its right to such is "clear and indisputable" and because it has alternative means to obtain relief.

<p>Authorities around the world have been tracking down members and supporters of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] and other terrorists groups. Last month, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-senate-reauthorizes-fisa-surveillance-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr5949enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr5949enr.pdf">Reauthorization Act of 2012</a> [text, PDF] to extend the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-110hr6304enr/pdf/BILLS-110hr6304enr.pdf">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008</a> (FISA) [text, PDF] for five years. FISA grants the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] the authority to conduct surveillance of Americans&#8217; phone calls and emails in attempts to protect against terrorism and other foreign threats. During the same month, Canada's controversial <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Bill=C36&Language=e&Mode=1&Parl=37&Ses=1&View=1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text; CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/">backgrounder</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/canada-supreme-court-upholds-anti-terror-law.php">deemed constitutional</a> [JURIST report] by the country's <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

Taylor's 42-point <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gUkXwwzmL1medQGE7ozMpoRx7cog?docId=CNG.43e689344954eb49bd394705f7a51ce7.5f1">appeal</a> [AFP report] states that the the UN-backed <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) [official website] made "systematic errors" in evaluating evidence and relied on hearsay testimony of the 94 prosecution witnesses as the basis for its fact-finding. The former leader was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> to 50 years in prison in May after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/charles-taylor-convicted-of-war-crimes.php">convicted</a>  [JURIST reports] of war crimes a month earlier. He was accused of planning as well as aiding and abetting crimes committed by rebel forces in exchange for diamonds during the civil war, including acts of terrorism, murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting or enlisting children into armed forces, enslavement and pillage. Specifically Taylor was convicted of 11 counts for arming Sierra Leone's rebels in return for "blood diamonds" during the war. On appeal the prosecution is asking the court to overturn Taylor's acquittal on charges that he actively issued orders to the rebels, and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21134892">increase Taylor's sentence</a> [BBC report] to 80 years. At the original sentencing hearing Taylor <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/former-liberian-president-charles-taylor.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] he had "sadness and deepest sympathy for the atrocities and crimes suffered in Sierra Leone" but that he was not responsible for actions taken by rebel forces during the decade-long civil war that claimed 120,000 lives.

<p>In October JURIST Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/jallohc">Charles Jalloh</a> [university profile] of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law <a href="/forum/2012/10/charles-jalloh-sow-scsl.php">examined allegations</a> [JURIST op-ed] made by Alternate Judge El Hadji Malick Sow at the end of Charles Taylor's trial, arguing for the establishment of an independent fact-finding commission to promote transparency and public confidence in the SCSL. In June <a href="http://ualr.edu/law/faculty/full-time-faculty-a-g/kenneth-gallant/">Kenneth Gallant</a> of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law wrote that Taylor's sentencing should have <a href="/forum/2012/06/kenneth-gallant-taylor-reparations.php">included the provision of reparations for his victims</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the prosecution ought to raise that issue on appeal. In February Taylor's lawyers asked that the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lawyers-for-ex-liberia-president-Taylor-seek-to-reopen-war-crimes-case.php">reopen the case</a> [JURIST report] in light of new evidence, including a report by the UN Panel of Experts on Liberia. His lawyers claimed that the new evidence demonstrated that Taylor was not instrumental in the war crimes committed by rebel forces, but the court declined to reopen the case. The SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/war-crimes-trial-of-ex-liberia-president-taylor-concludes.php">heard closing arguments</a> [JURIST report] in March 2011. Taylor <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied all the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him. His defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">opened their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 and have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the newly-amended law, titled, "Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Bill," police may detain and question a person who has been arrested <a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive_13A/Jan22_1358866338CH.php">without a warrant for 48 hours</a> [<em>Colombo Page</em> report] before producing the suspect in court. According to Cabinet Minister of Environment Anura Yapa, who also serves as a Member of Parliament, the <a href="http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2013/Sri-Lankan-Parliament-passes-law-allowing-police-to-question-suspects-2-days-without-charges/id-d2de0971b6b343e6b4a0a4cc6d6c20b5">legislation is meant to assist</a> [AP report] in the fight against organized crime. However, many activists, including protesters demonstrating against the new law in the country's capital city of Colombo, see the extension of police power as a legalized means of suppressing dissident views amongst citizens. 

<p>The controversial new law comes on the heels of the impeachment and removal of Sri Lanka's Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bandaranayake">Shirani Bandaranayake</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last week Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-president-signs-order-removing-chief-justice-from-office.php">signed the order</a> to remove Bandaranayake from office after the parliament voted in an overwhelming majority <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/sri-lanka-parliament-votes-to-impeach-chief-justice.php">favoring impeachment</a> [JURIST reports]. Bandaranayake had been <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lanka-chief-justice-convicted-on-three-misconduct-charges.php">found guilty of three charges</a> [JURIST report] of misconduct, including conflict of interest, failure to declare assets in official reports and bias in handling a case against her husband. <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-impeachment-of-sri-lanka-chief-justice.php">Described by the UN</a> [JURIST report] as a "calamitous setback for the rule of law in Sri Lanka," political shakeups throughout the country have proven to be a source of domestic and international criticism. </p>]]></content:encoded>

UNAMA interviewed 635 conflict-related detainees in detention facilities across Afghanistan, finding that more than half of those interviewed had <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43964&Cr=torture&Cr1=#.UP6yCugapFU">experienced maltreatment and torture</a> [UN News Centre report]. Fourteen different methods of torture were described, including prolonged and severe beatings with cables, pipes, hoses or wooden sticks, and suspension from the ceiling by the wrists or from chains attached to the wall so that the victim's toes barely touch the ground or he is completely suspended in the air for lengthy periods. Detainees were also threatened with sexual violence or execution. Where torture occurred, it generally took the form of abusive interrogation techniques by Afghan officials seeking information or a confession:<blockquote>UNAMA found sufficiently credible and reliable evidence that more than half of 635 detainees interviewed (326 detainees) experienced torture and ill-treatment in numerous facilities of the Afghan National Police (ANP), National Directorate of Security (NDS), Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan Local Police (ALP) between October 2011 and October 2012. This finding is similar to UNAMA's findings for October 2010-11 which determined that almost half of the detainees interviewed who had been held in NDS facilities and one third of detainees interviewed who had been held in ANP facilities experienced torture or ill-treatment at the hands of ANP or NDS officials.</blockquote>UNAMA also noted that while both the NDS and the Ministry of Interior have stated that they investigated allegations of ill-treatment, it is unclear whether any of these internal probes resulted in the prosecution or loss of jobs of Afghan officials for involvement in torturing detainees or for having failed to prevent torture.

<p>UNAMA released the first <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">report on detainee torture</a> [JURIST report] in October 2011, detailing findings similar to those in the report released this week. Last month UNAMA released another report detailing the implementation of the <a href="http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/EVAW%20law%20-%202009.pdf">Law of Elimination of Violence against Women</a> (EVAW law) [text, PDF] enacted in August 2009, finding that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">women in Afghanistan still face abuse</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of men despite progress in the implementation of a law to protect women's rights. In November <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged the Afghan government to institute a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/afghanistan-government-ends-death-penalty-moratorium-with-8-executions.php">moratorium on further executions</a> [JURIST report] after eight men were hanged, marking an end of Afghanistan's four-year virtual moratorium on the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last month the Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icc-confirms-jurisdiction-over-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">confirmed its jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over Gbagbo, unanimously dismissing his challenge. In November the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">unsealed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo's wife, Simone, marking the first time that the court has charged a female. Also in November the court found Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-finds-ivory-coast-ex-president-fit-to-stand-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. In October the ICC denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance to leave</a> the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] in November. The court denied Gbagbo's leave request upon a determination that he posed a flight risk. The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. Ouattara was declared the winner of the 2010 election, and was able to take office following Gbagbo's removal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Philippines <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/">Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario</a> [official website] stated in a press conference the country's intent to bring China before an Arbitral Tribunal under Article 287 and Annex VII of the <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/UNCLOS-TOC.htm">1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) [text]. In his statement, Rosario noted:<blockquote>The Philippines has exhausted almost all political and diplomatic avenues for a peaceful negotiated settlement of its maritime dispute with China. On numerous occasions, dating back to 1995, the Philippines has been exchanging views with China to peacefully settle these disputes. To this day, a solution is still elusive. We hope that the Arbitral Proceedings shall bring this dispute to a durable solution.</blockquote>The Philippines hopes arbitration will bring China in line with UNCLOS, as well as force it to desist from hostile activities that violate the rights of the Philippines to have sovereignty in their own territorial domains. The <a href="http://www.dfa.gov.ph/index.php/downloads/doc_download/523-notification-and-statement-of-claim-on-west-philippine-sea">Notification and Statement of Claims</a> [text, PDF] filed by the Philippines notes Chinese escalation in interference with Philippines maritime rights. It cites <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/world/asia/china-sends-troops-to-disputed-islands.html?_r=0">China's July decision</a> [NYT report] to place the entire disputed maritime region under the authority of the Chinese province of Hainan and its passage of a law requiring foreign vessels to obtain Chinese permission before entering the disputed region. 

<p>China claims nearly the entire 3.5 million square-kilometer South China Sea, a region believed to be rich in oil and minerals. China has come into territorial conflict over the region in the past not only <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/edsel-tupaz-spratlys-dispute.php">with the Philippines</a> [JURIST comment], but also with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines and China were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/201273093650328417.html">involved in a two month stand-off</a> [Al Jazeera report] that started last April around the Scarborough Shoal, a small cluster of uninhabitable islands 220km off the coast of the Philippines which, according to international maritime law, fall into the Philippines' economic zone. The standoff was triggered when Chinese vessels blocked the Philippine navy from arresting Chinese fishermen for alleged illegal fishing activities within the Philippines' exclusive economic zones. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawyers, including <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_TURKEY_JAILED_LAWYERS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">some human rights advocates</a> [AP report], are accused of being associated with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3591119.stm">Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front</a> (RPLP) [BBC profile], a group that advocates for a Marxist state and has claimed responsibility for violence and assassinations in the country since the 1970s. The lawyers were detained for questioning last week in a nationwide crackdown by the Turkish government on members of the RPLP in which about 70 others were also detained. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/22/turkey-nine-human-rights-lawyers-imprisoned">condemned</a> [press release] the arrests as illustrative of Turkey's overly-broad anti-terrorism laws, which it claims have been used to suppress legitimate activities in violation of Turkey's obligations under the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. In addition to criticizing the law itself, HRW has accused Turkey of utilizing prolonged pretrial detention. The lawyers who were charged have been arrested and are awaiting trial.

<p>Turkey's record on human rights has faced much criticism from the international community recently. In December a UN human rights expert declared that Turkey must be more proactive in <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-expert-turkey-must-do-more-to-end-unlawful-killings.php">ending extrajudicial killings</a> [JURIST report] by prosecuting those who perpetrate violence, especially violence against women. In November the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">criticized Turkey</a> [JURIST report] for prosecuting activists under the country's vague counter-terrorism law. In October the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/echr-rules-detention-of-gay-man-violated-rights-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey detained a gay man in violation of Articles 3 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In July Turkey's parliament voted to <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-parliament-abolishes-special-courts.aspx?pageID=238&nID=24507&NewsCatID=338">abolish the special courts</a> [<em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> report] used in coup and terrorism trials, which were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/turkey-to-abolish-controversial-special-courts-report.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST report] for being out of control and forcing defendants to spend years in detention without receiving a verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khar <a href="http://www.nzweek.com/world/pakistani-fm-says-world-shows-concerns-on-u-s-drone-strikes-44145/">stated</a> [NZ week report] that the drone attacks are "counterproductive" and that she plans to discuss the issue with the US and its ambassador to Pakistan. Earlier this month, retired general Stanley McChrystal expressed similar concerns <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/07/us-usa-afghanistan-mcchrystal-idUSBRE90608O20130107">cautioning</a> [Reuters report] against the overuse of drone attacks and stating that their use breeds resentment around the world. US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archive], who <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18270490">personally approves</a> [BBC report] each drone strike against suspected terrorists, is expected to sign off on a manual which will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/world/white-house-presses-for-drone-rule-book.html?pagewanted=all">establish rules</a> [NYT report] for the administration's targeted killing program.

<p>The increasing use of drone strikes by the Obama administration has come under scrutiny recently. Last month the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. In July Pakistan's Ambassador to the US called upon the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of using drone strikes in targeted killings. That same month, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of drone strikes. JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the Muslim Civil Liberties Union recently argued that Obama administration's drone policy <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">sets a dangerous precedent</a> [JURIST comment] and undermines national security.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Auburn Regional Medical Center</a> [JURIST report] that 10-year-old final rulings for <a href = "http://www.medicare.gov/">Medicare</a> [official website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Medicare">news archive</a>] reimbursement cannot be appealed to the <a href = "http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] beyond the deadlines previously set by the Secretary of HHS, despite evidence of intentional concealment that prevented the appeals. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion for the court. The court held that the 180-day statutory deadline to appeal to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) from a final Medicare payment determination, under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395oo">42 USC &#167; 1395oo(a)(3)</a> [text] is not "jurisdictional," and thus it was up to HHS, an agency, to set the statute of limitations. The court also held that the principle of <a href = "http://definitions.uslegal.com/e/equitable-tolling/">equitable tolling</a> [backgrounder] "does not similarly apply to administrative appeals of the kind here considered." The holding <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/AUBURN_REGIONAL_MEDICAL_CENTER_v_SEBELIUS_642_F3d_1145_DC_Cir_201">reversed</a> [opinion] the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred to suggest that the question of whether any agency decision is immune from equitable tolling has not been answered. "I write separately to note that the Court's decision in this case does not establish that equitable tolling principles are irrelevant to internal administrative deadlines in all, or even most, contexts. The Court is correct that our equitable tolling cases have typically involved deadlines to bring suit in federal court. But we have never suggested that the presumption in favor of equitable tolling is generally inapplicable to administrative deadlines."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <span class = "casename">Dire</span>, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the law can be applied to current international standards of piracy. The opinion also endorsed the definition of piracy under the <a href = "https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/UNCLOS-TOC.htm">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) [materials] and applied it as "customary international law" for the purposes of the piracy statute. "We also agree with the district court that the definition of piracy under the law of nations, at the time of the defendants' attack on the USS Nicholas and continuing today, had for decades encompassed their violent conduct. That definition, spelled out in the UNCLOS, as well as the High Seas Convention before it, has only been reaffirmed in recent years as nations around the world have banded together to combat the escalating scourge of piracy."

<p>Last month, the Chief Judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-rules-us-has-jurisdiction-over-somali-pirates-in-murder-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Somalia's territorial waters extend no more than 12 miles from shore, concluding that the US has jurisdiction to prosecute a band of pirates accused of murdering four Americans in 2011. The month before, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-piracy-off-somalia-coast.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] piracy and acts of armed robbery against vessels off the coast of Somalia. The Security Council urged the international community to develop a comprehensive response to discourage these acts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act of 1970</a> (CSA) [text] permits the DEA to place narcotics into various Schedule classes and permits outside groups to request reclassification of those narcotics. Schedule I is the most restrictive classification for drugs and includes heroin. Marijuana's inclusion in this schedule means that its production, sale and consumption is largely banned by federal law, despite the growing number of states that permit its medicinal and recreational use. <a href="http://safeaccessnow.org/">Americans for Safe Access</a> (ASA) [advocacy website] requested reclassification by the DEA and filed suit in federal court when they were denied. ASA asserted that "[n]umerous peer-reviewed scientific studies demonstrate that marijuana is effective in treating various medical conditions, but the DEA simply 
ignores them to conclude that marijuana should remain in Schedule I." In response the court held:<blockquote>[T]he parties' dispute in this case turns on the agency's interpretation of its own regulations. Petitioners construe "adequate and well-controlled studies" to mean peer-reviewed, published studies suggesting marijuana's medical efficacy. The DEA, in contrast, interprets that factor to require something more scientifically rigorous. ... The DEA's construction of its regulation is eminently reasonable. Therefore, we are obliged to defer to the agency's interpretation of "adequate and well-controlled studies."</blockquote>The DEA's standard for acceptable scientific findings are similar to the evidence required by the Food and Drug Administration in New Drug Applications. In reaching its decision, the court did reject an argument by the DEA that the plaintiffs lacked the standing to pursue the case.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] was a hot-button issue in several states in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">November 6 election</a> [JURIST report], with Washington and Colorado legalizing the drug. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">failed by approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote. Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [Harvard Crimson report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/2012%20Proposed%20Initiatives%20and%20Referenda/Marijuana%20Proposal%20Text%20for%20web.pdf">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Issue 5, PDF] was <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/232534/2/ISSUE-5-Medical-marijuana-measure-rejected">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52 to 48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana. Also on the ballot in Montana was a veto referendum regarding a <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/2011/billhtml/SB0423.htm">2011 revision</a> [SB 423] of a 2004 law that established medical marijuana use in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a> in Davos, Switzerland, Davutoglu <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_SYRIA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2013-01-23-09-13-05">stated</a> [AP report] that cities were being "bombarded ... indiscriminately" and that the government is committing criminal acts. Both sides of the conflict have intensified attacks while diplomacy has failed to provide a solution. The recent escalation of violence in Syria included a government rocket attack on Wednesday that hit a northern village of Abu Taltal in the Aleppo province village controlled by rebel factions and killed six family members. 

<p>The Syrian government has been engaged in a bloody conflict with numerous <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15798218">opposition groups</a> [BBC backgrounder] since March 2011 when nationwide protests opposing the government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashar+assad">news archive</a>] began.

UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valerie Amos</a> and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profiles] stated last Friday that the continued violence in Syria has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-officials-indiscriminate-violence-worsening-aid-situation-in-syria.php">harming civilian human rights</a> [JURIST report] and humanitarian attempts at aiding those in need.

The petition challenged a June <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=11-1566_002.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] which found the petitioner, Robert Sherman, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-citizen-cannot-sue-over-state-funded-cross-restoration.php">lacked standing to sue the state</a> [JURIST report] because the legislature did not choose the specific organizations that would receive the money. The money was part of a $5 million appropriation for a grant program to be administered by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

<p>The challenge was initially brought in August 2010 by Sherman, who has said on his <a href="http://www.robsherman.com/news/home.htm">website</a> [advocacy website] that the decision of the District Court was "bizarre" and "preposterous." In October 2010 the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-illinois-school-moment-of-silence-law.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Sherman's challenge to the constitutionality of an Illinois statute that mandates a daily moment of silence in public schools. The court reversed an April 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-illinois-school.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?GAID=9&SessionID=51&GA=95&DocTypeID=SB&DocNum=1463&LegID=&SpecSess=&Session">Illinois Reflection and Silent Prayer Act</a> [text] is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion in public schools.

Section 112 of the <a href="http://www.samuiforsale.com/Law-Texts/thailand-penal-code.html">Thai Penal Code</a> [text] is the lese majeste law, which reads: "Whoever, defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years." Somyot was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21155704">sentenced</a> [BBC report] to five years for each of two articles negatively mentioning the monarchy that he <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/thailand-sentences-editor-jail-royal-insult">published under pseudonyms</a> [AP report] in his magazine, Voice of Taksin, in 2010. He was sentenced to an additional year from a suspended defamation case that was over three years old. Somyot and the magazine were associated with Thailand's "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268">red-shirt</a>" [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=red+shirt">news archive</a>] movement, which led <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/thailand-truth-commission-releases-report-about-2010-unrest.php">anti-government protests in 2010</a> [JURIST report]. Somyot was arrested five days after launching a petition calling for a review of the lese majeste laws. The sentence has been criticized by both <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], which said the ruling was more <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/23/thailand-editor-convicted-insulting-monarchy">akin to punishment</a> [press release] for Somyot's support for amending the lese majeste law than it was about any harm to the monarchy, and by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">said</a> [press release], "People exercising freedom of expression should not be punished in the first place." Sumyot's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict but will not seek a royal pardon.

<p>Thailand's lese majeste laws have generated controversy. US citizen Joe Gordon was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/thailand-monarch-pardons-us-citizen-on-defamation-charge.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from a Thai prison in July on a royal pardon that commuted a two-and-a-half-year sentence for defaming the Thai royal family. Gordon was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-citizen-sentenced-to-prison-for-insulting-thailand-royalty.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in December 2011 after pleading guilty in October. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Frank La Rue</a> [official website] recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-condemns-thailand-royal-insult-law.php">condemned the lese majeste law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the guilty plea was submitted: "The threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression. ... This is exacerbated by the fact that the charges can be brought by private individuals and trials are often closed to the public." In 2009 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-condemns-closed-thailand.php">public trial</a> [JURIST report] for a Thai political activist accused of lese majeste. In 2009 a Thai court sentenced an anti-coup protester to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/thailand-court-sentences-political.php">18 years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The first case,  <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In their <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Prop.-8-merits-brief-1-22-13.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] in support of the law, a group of California citizens argued that they have standing to defend the law that the governor and state attorney general declined to defend in court. They further argued that the court should find the law to be a constitutional exercise of state marriage regulation. In the second case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. In its <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BLAG-merits-brief-1-22-131.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF], the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) urged the court not to raise the constitutional standard of evaluation for laws that unequally impact gay and lesbian individuals. BLAG argued, however, that even under a heightened standard of scrutiny, DOMA is constitutional. The court will also consider in this case if BLAG had standing to intervene and if the DOJ's refusal to defend the law deprives the Supreme Court of jurisdiction, but these issues were not addressed in Tuesday's brief. 

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the two cases last month. Both cases could have an important impact on the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] controversy in the US. In early December Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In the same time frame, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit corporation in Nevada which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to grant <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires Nevada to change its definition of marriage from the union of a man and a woman to the union of two persons. In November, the office of the Maryland Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">released an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that same-sex couples can obtain marriage licenses, allowing Maryland to become the ninth US state to allow same sex marriage after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> [JURIST reports] enacted similar measures in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report was created by a panel led by <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/jsverma.htm">Justice Jagdish Sharan Verma</a> [official profile] which was established to respond to mass protests in India following the December <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765320">gang rape</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20860569">subsequent death</a> [BBC reports] of a 23-year-old medical student in New Dehli. The report provides a host of suggestions advocating for reform in all spheres of Indian life including political, judicial and cultural reform. The report reserves its harshest criticism for the manner in which police and the judiciary currently respond to rape accusations and suggests that the most pressing efforts the government should undertake include increasing police accountability and harsher penalties for those convicted of sexual assault. The report did not go so far as to suggest the death penalty for those convicted of rape, which some in the country have been urging. Other recommendations include the creation of specific courts to handle rape cases, increased enforcement of laws restricting human trafficking, and additional judicial resources to allow for speedier trials and appeals of rape cases.

<p>In December Indian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">charged six suspects</a> [JURIST report] with murder after the death of the gang rape victim.

Though Cameron stressed reluctance to leave the EU altogether, he explained that the institution has become <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-britain-europe-idUSBRE90L16D20130123">too involved in bureaucratic processes</a> [Reuters report] rather than trade deals, and that he wishes to see his country and the EU agree on several reforms to combat the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis">eurozone debt crisis</a> [<em>The Guardian</em> backgrounder]. Advocating change, Cameron further asserted that the UK would fight to ensure that new rules dealing with the crisis were fair to the 10 EU countries that do not currently use the euro as common currency. Ultimately, he declared that the referendum, which he hopes would be held by the end of 2017, would present British citizens with a simple "in-out" choice on whether to stay in the EU after his highly-sought re-negotiations of the UK's membership have concluded.

<p>In October 2011 the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] voted 483-111 <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-parliament-votes-down-referendum-on-eu-membership.php">against holding a national referendum</a> [JURIST report] on remaining an EU member. In that proposal, the referendum would have put forward three options for a vote: to remain in the EU, to leave the EU, or to re-negotiate membership terms. In 1975 the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm">UK held a referendum</a> [BBC backgrounder] to determine whether to leave the European Economic Community (EEC). There, only two years after the country had joined the EEC, just over 67 percent of voters supported the move to remain in the European institution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All three patents were related to electronic commerce and disclosed a system where a merchant computer could accept purchase requests from consumers and process payments. Newegg argued that its system was materially different from the one disclosed by the three patents because it relies upon cookies and that Soverain's patents were invalid because they were obvious in light of electronic commerce systems known before the patented system. The Federal Circuit agreed and found all of the asserted claims in the three patents to be invalid due to obviousness. The decision also represents a <a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2013/01/22/appeals-court-overturns-25-million-patent-judgment-agains">victory for other e-retailers</a> [Internet Retailer report] against whom Soverain has asserted its patents, including <a href="http://www.avon.com/">Avon</a> and <a href="http://www.victoriassecret.com/">Victoria's Secret</a> [corporate websites], which had been ordered to pay $18 million in damages to Soverain. Newegg was the only one of seven e-retailers sued by Soverain not to enter a licensing agreement. In August 2005 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Amazon-pays-40-million-to-settle-patent-dispute/2100-1030_3-5829193.html">paid $40 million to settle</a> [CNET report] with Soverain for allegedly infringing Soverain's e-commerce patents.

The law makes it a crime for a registered sex offender to be a member of a "social networking" site defined as a site that facilitates the introduction of persons, allows a person to create a personal profile and provides the opportunity for communication between persons. The court determined that the law targeted free speech and thus deserved careful scrutiny. In the opinion, Judge Joel Flaum wrote:<blockquote>Though content neutral, we conclude that the Indiana law is not narrowly tailored to serve the state's interest. It broadly prohibits substantial protected speech rather than specifically targeting the evil of improper communications to minors. ... Subsequent Indiana statutes may well meet this requirement, but the blanket ban on social media in this case regrettably does not.</blockquote>The court also noted Indiana already has measures in place that prohibit sex offenders from contacting minors.

<p>The rights of convicted sex offenders have been the subject of many constitution-based lawsuits. In October a California resident <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-resident-sues-four-orange-county-cities-over-sex-offender-ordinances.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] four Orange County cities over sex offender ordinances. In August a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-indiana-sex-offender-registry-violated-due-process.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the Indiana sex offender registry saying it violated due process. In January the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-on-sex-offender-registration-act.php">ruled 7-2</a> [JURIST report] that people who were convicted of sex offenses before the enactment of the federal <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> [final guidelines, PDF] did not have to register under the act until the attorney general validly specified that the provisions applied to them. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-new-mexico-sex-offender-library-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ordinance that banned sex offenders from libraries in Albuquerque, New Mexico. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Though she previously ruled the practice unconstitutional, Judge Shira Scheindlin ultimately agreed with city lawyers that complying with the former order would place an undue burden on the NYPD to train thousands of officers and their supervisors, and that "it may be difficult to say where, precisely, to draw the line between constitutional and unconstitutional police encounters." The "stop-and-frisk" policy developed as part of the city's <a href="http://manhattanda.org/trespass-affidavit-program">Trespass Affidavit Program</a> (TAP) [Manhattan DA backgrounder], which allows property managers in the program to ask officers to patrol their buildings and arrest trespassers as a means of combating drug dealing in the public areas of such buildings.

<p>Only two weeks ago, Judge Scheindlin declared the NYPD's "stop-and-frisk" policy <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-declares-nypd-stop-and-frish-policy-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] on grounds that it violates the protection against unreasonable search and seizures of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">Fourth Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">backgrounder</a>]. There, she reasoned that officers were not first meeting their requirement of developing a reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk supposed trespassers. Scheindlin's original decision was the first federal ruling to find that the "stop-and-frisk" practice is unconstitutional, though the NYPD has recently received a great deal of scrutiny for various allegations of misconduct. In July a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the NYPD used excessive force and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. In May, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution. In March, NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly fervently <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">denied</a> [speech; <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_18_ny_times_is_wrong.shtml">press release</a>] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This practice is encouraged in countries such as Morocco and India, where the loss of a woman's virginity out of wedlock brings shame upon the family. Article 475, translated from French, reads, "When a minor removed or diverted married her captor, the latter can not be prosecuted on the complaint of persons entitled to apply for annulment of marriage and can not be sentenced until after the cancellation of marriage has been pronounced." Women's rights activists welcomed the news but claimed it is only the first step in reforming the penal code to prevent discrimination and violence against women. 

<p>Tuesday's announcement takes place nearly a year after 16-year-old Amina al-Filali <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20120317-morocco-women-stage-protest-against-rape-laws">committed suicide</a> [AFP report] after she was forced to marry her alleged rapist. Soon after, Protesters in Morocco rallied to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/protesters-rally-against-morocco-rape-marriage-law-after-teen-suicide.php">call for the reform</a> [JURIST report] of Article 475. In July 2011 Moroccan voters overwhelmingly approved a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/morocco-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-revised-constitution.php">revised version of the constitution</a> [JURIST report], highlighted by fewer powers reserved for their king. The constitutional revisions were a product of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/morocco-king-announces-plans-for-constitutional-reform.php">reform process announced</a> [JURIST report] last April following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST reports] demanding democratic reforms as part of the wider protests in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=middle+east+protest">news archive</a>]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Approximately 10,000 people can <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/291795/news/nation/bicam-ok-s-bill-on-payments-to-human-rights-victims-of-marcos-regime">claim compensation</a> [Reuters report] based on abuses that took place between when Marcos instated martial law in 1972 until he was overthrown in 1986. Should the bill be passed by a plenary session of Congress on Monday and signed into law by current President Benigno Aquino III, an independent body would be established to distribute the funds to those claiming to have suffered abuse.  

<p>The Philippines has struggled in terms of addressing human rights issues from the Marcos regime to as recently as the 2009 <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">Maguindanao Massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] and the resulting political controversies.

The statement came at the end of a 10-day visit to the UK where Kiai visited with senior officials in London, Belfast and Edinburgh. Kiai highlighted several policies in the respective regions that give cause for concern. In England and Wales, Kiai noted that there have been great improvements in the policing of demonstrations but expressed concern over the practice of "kettling" which is holding a large group of protesters for long periods of time without water or sanitary services and then requesting names and addresses as they are allowed to leave. He said that this "has a powerful chilling effect on the exercise of freedom of peaceful assembly, and I was informed of many people who refrained from exercising their right to freedom of peaceful assembly for fear of being kettled." In Northern Ireland, Kiai emphasized the importance of easing tensions between "protestants/unionists/loyalists and the catholics/nationalists/republicans" and easing the tension caused by "flag protests." Kiai also denounced cost recovery mechanisms in Scotland that greatly increase the cost of parades and demonstrations. Finally, Kiai addressed the practice of blacklisting union members:<blockquote>I was appalled to hear about the existence of a blacklist of union members in the construction industry, with no sanctions allegedly taken against those who benefitted from the list. It is crucial that strong actions be taken against the making and using of such lists as a deterrence.</blockquote>Kiai's findings from the visit will be finalized and put into a report then will be presented in front of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in June. 

<p>The visit came seven months after a report on the state of the freedom of assembly in the international community was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-expert-urges-international-community-to-protect-freedom-of-assembly.php">released</a> [JURIST report] by the UN. Last March Switzerland was <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-expert-warns-of-switzerland-laws-chilling-effect-on-free-speech.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] for a proposal to change the existing law imposing heavy fines of 100,000 Swiss Francs ($110,000) for people who protest without prior governmental authorization. In December 2011 a UN panel of independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malaysia-bill-will-curb-peaceful-assembly-rights-un-experts.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Malaysia not to adopt a proposed bill that forbids the country's citizens under the age of 21 and non-citizens from assembling, enacting conditional access for media to public gatherings and outlawing street protests altogether. A month earlier Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Syria committed several human rights violations including the right to peaceful assembly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/americas/20121019-twitter-agrees-block-anti-semitic-tweets-french">lawsuit was brought</a> [RFI report] by the <a href="www.uejf.org/">Jewish Students' Union of France</a> (UEJF) [advocacy website, in French] last October after a series of anti-Semitic and racist tweets emerged on the social media website, with most messages using the hashtag #AGoodJew. While UEJF <a href="http://www.english.rfi.fr/culture/20130124-twitter-ordered-identify-french-anti-semitic-tweeters">welcomed the decision</a> [RFI report], some reactionaries to the ruling actually decided to increase their anti-Semitic tweets. UEJF admitted that there is still work to be done regarding anti-Semitic culture in France but declared it is nonetheless pleased with the progressive step taken by the French court. Twitter faces a fine of 1,000 euros per day if it does not comply with Thursday's order within two weeks. 

<p><a href="/currentawareness/antisemitism.php">Anti-Semitism</a> [JURIST news archive] has not recently received much international attention, though it has long been an issue of global concern. In 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/anti-semitic-incidents-on-rise-in.php">Canada released a report</a> [JURIST report] indicating that anti-Semitism in the country had risen 11.4 percent since 2008. The report, released by <a href="www.bnaibrith.ca/">B'nai Brith Canada</a> [advocacy website], also found that anti-Semitic incidents increased globally in 2009, linking them to a rise in Middle East strike. In March 2009 the <a href="fra.europa.eu/">EU Agency for Fundamental Rights</a> (FRA) [official website] found that there was a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/eu-report-finds-european-anti-semitism.php">rise in European anti-Semitism incidents</a> [JURIST report] since December of that year. In November 2008, the German parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/german-lawmakers-pass-anti-semitism.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] requiring the government to track reports of anti-Semitism in the country and fund education to combat the problem. In July 2008 the <a href="hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [offical website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/council-of-europe-report-urges-nations.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] emphasizing the need for European countries to examine their human rights records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its report, the <a href="http://eipr.org/en">Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights</a> (EIPR) [advocacy website] said that police conduct has not improved since the abuses experienced under former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>]. The report accused the current administration under <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi">news archive</a>] of promoting continued impunity for police misconduct:<blockquote>There has also been no thoroughgoing change, or even cosmetic improvement, in the police apparatus, whether related to its administrative structure, decision-making, oversight of police work or the reform and removal of leaders and personnel responsible for torture and killing. There has also been no notable change to rules regulating the use of force and firearms, and no amendments to the statutory framework governing police work. The Interior Ministry, backed by the cabinet at times, continues to defend criminal police personnel by denying the facts, justifying abuses or turning a blind eye as policemen facing criminal charges pressure their victims to change their statements to undermine the case.</blockquote>The rights group urged the Egyptian government to modify current laws to provide clear protection for citizens from police misconduct, and to establish an independent committee to review allegations of abuse by law enforcement. 

<p>The new Egyptian government has faced heavy criticism from rights groups, particularly in relation to provisions of the <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt-s-draft-constitution-translated">newly adopted constitution</a> [text, in English]. Earlier this month,  Amnesty International called for Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ai-to-egypt-release-journalist-facing-military-trial.php">release an Egyptian journalist</a> [JURIST report] facing a military trial under a new provision of the constitution that permits the government to try some civilians in military court. Following the adoption of the constitution in December, a coalition of Egyptian rights group called for a re-vote, alleging <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-rights-groups-call-for-new-vote-on-constitution.php">widespread irregularities</a> [JURIST report] in voting procedures. Supporters of the document from the Muslim Brotherhood, however, claimed its approval was the valid choice of the people. It was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Morsi weeks after its approval. Earlier in December, a UN committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] about a draft of the constitution, noting that no women were involved in drafting the document and that their rights were "grossly under-represented." In November AI also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] that the approved constitution contains language that "ignores the rights of women, restricts freedom of expression in the name of protecting religion, and allows for the military trial of civilians." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/01/24/capitol-offense-1">report</a> [text], titled "Capitol Offense: Police Mishandling of Sexual Assault Cases in the District of Columbia," is based on a 22-month investigation that found that MPD officers regularly did not file sexual assault incident reports and misclassified serious assaults as lesser or other crimes. In particular, the report found that more than 200 cases between October 2008 and September 2011, or just over 40 percent of cases reviewed, appear never to have been documented or properly investigated. As a result, HRW recommended that the DC mayor and city council create an independent mechanism to monitor the MPD's response to complaints of sexual assault. Until this mechanism is established, claimed HRW, there is a "serious risk" of further mishandling of sexual assault cases, thus "causing many traumatized victims further suffering and deterring others from coming forward at all."

<p>Reporting, preventing, and investigating sexual assault and similar crimes is an issue of international significance. Earlier this month UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-sg-calls-for-reform-to-protect-women-in-india.php">called on India's government</a> [JURIST report] to "strengthen critical services for rape victims," expressing sympathy for the family of the 23-year-old medical student who died from injuries sustained in a gang-rape last month. In October the US <a href="www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that overall violent crime, which includes rape and sexual assault, has <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-violent-property-crime-rates-increased-in-2011-doj.php">increased by 17 percent</a> [JURIST report] since 1993. In July a human rights group released a report documenting 81 instances of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-group-reports-sexual-assault-a-weapon-in-syria-violence.php">sexual assault and rape in Syria</a> [JURIST report] since anti-government demonstrations began in March 2011. A month prior, HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/syria-using-sexual-violence-as-torture-hrw.php">Syrian forces are sexually abusing</a> [JURIST report] men, women, and children who have been detained during the ongoing conflict. In April two former cadets from the <a href="http://www.usma.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx">US Military Academy</a> and the <a href="http://www.usna.edu/homepage.php">US Naval Academy</a> [official websites] brought a suit in New York alleging that the service academies <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/former-cadets-sue-service-academies-for-failing-to-prevent-rapes.php">failed to prevent rapes</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/01/25/news/national/two-in-a-row-for-ashraf/">charges</a> [<em>Pakistan Today</em> report] are a response to accusations that Ashraf may have enabled Tauqir Sadiq, former chairman of Pakistan's <A href="http://www.ogra.org.pk/">Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority</a> (OGRA) [official website], to embezzle over 83 billion rupees ($850 million) before he fled the nation. The criminal charges imposed by the court follow different <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-arrest-of-prime-minister.php">corruption charges</a> levied against Ashraf earlier this month by the court, which the NAB's chief executive <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-official-refuses-to-arrest-prime-minister.php">refused to enforce</a> [JURIST reports]. The court had also announced on Wednesday that it would launch its own <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/kamran_faisal_case.pdf">independent investigation</a> [order, PDF] of Ashraf following the death of a NAB official who was investigating Ashraf for corruption. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21162012">order</a> [BBC report] follows the mysterious <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/18/pakistani-anti-corruption-official-hanged">death of Kamran Faisal</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] who was discovered hanged in his room in Islamabad last week. 

<p>Ashraf's brief term as Prime Minister has been fraught with conflict and tension between the executive and the judiciary. Ashraf's predecessor, Yousuf Raza Gilani, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">forced out</a> as prime minister last June after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">convicted him of contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president. In July, only a month after Ashraf became prime minister, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-high-court-orders-new-pm-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">ordered him to reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] within three weeks. The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-shield-pm-from-contempt-proceedings.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to shield senior officials from contempt of court proceedings, which was widely seen as an attempt to exempt Ashraf from possible claims of contempt for failing to follow the order. When Ashraf did not do as the court requested, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-high-court-postpones-order-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">granted him</a> [JURIST report] another two weeks to comply with its order. When in early August Ashraf still did not reopen the investigation, the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-orders-to-explain-refusal-to-reopen-case-against-president.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] him to appear and explain his refusal to comply with the July orders. After his appearance in court, the Supreme Court then <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-grants-pm-additional-time-to-reopen-presidential-corruption-case.php">granted Ashraf an additional three weeks</a> [JURIST report] to reopen the corruption case. Finally, in mid-September, Ashraf agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pakistan-pm-to-allow-switzerland-to-reopen-corruption-charges-against-president.php">allow the corruption case to be reopened</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Emmerson said that after asking the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of its use of targeted killings last year, there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct. He stated an investigation by the UN was necessary in order to establish clear international guidelines on the use of this and other emerging technology:<blockquote>The exponential rise in the use of drone technology in a variety of military and non-military contexts represents a real challenge to the framework of established international law and it is both right as a matter of principle, and inevitable as a matter of political reality, that the international community should now be focussing attention on the standards applicable to this technological development, particularly its deployment in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency initiatives, and attempt to reach a consensus on the legality of its use, and the standards and safeguards which should apply to it.</blockquote>The investigation will study the motivations of the nations using the drones as well as the effects felt in the nations where the attacks were carried out. Emmerson said he would present his findings to the General Assembly in fall of 2013.

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under scrutiny in recent months. Earlier this month Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php">condemned US drone attacks</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. Last month the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. In July Pakistan's Ambassador to the US called upon the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of using drone strikes in targeted killings. That same month US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of drone strikes. JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the Muslim Civil Liberties Union recently argued that Obama administration's drone policy <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">sets a dangerous precedent</a> [JURIST comment] and undermines national security. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The arrest of Ibrahim followed an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/01/201315142216448735.html">story</a> [Al Jazeera report] alleging that rapes in the nation were frequent. In that report Ibrahim interviewed one woman who claimed she had been raped by government forces a few months prior. According to the groups' statement, the Central Investigation Department (CID) of the Somali police arrested the alleged victim, confiscated her phone to call Ibrahim and insisted he turn himself in. CID has since arrested two others who helped put the victim in touch with the reporter though they did release the alleged victim, allowing her husband to take her place in prison. According Daniel Bekele, Africa director at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/22/somalia-free-journalist-others-unlawfully-detained">HRW</a> [official statement]:<blockquote>Somalia's new government is saying the right things about the rule of law and a free press, but locking up journalists and others who report rape sends the opposite message. The authorities should release the four detainees, and ensure that the police investigate sexual violence effectively.</blockquote>Somalia's president, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19556383">Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud</a> [BBC profile], said he would not intervene in the actions of the CID and claimed that freedom of the press does not including criticism that tarnishes the government's reputation.

<p>After decades of violence and rights abuses under the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/somalia/somalias-transitional-government/p12475">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) [CFR backgrounder], Somalia is taking key steps to move towards peace. Last August the UN welcomed the signing of Somalia's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-welcomes-signing-of-somalia-national-stabilization-plan.php">National Security and Stabilization Plan</a> [JURIST report]. Also in August the Somalia constituent assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/somalia-special-assembly-approves-new-national-constitution.php">approved a draft of the new constitution</a> [JURIST report] with over 96 percent of the 645 ballots cast in the special 825-member assembly after eight days of debate. The new constitution also has to be ratified by a national referendum. Last June then-president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7865808.stm">Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed</a> [BBC profile] and the TFG <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-welcomes-somalias-ending-of-transitional-governing-arrangements.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] establishing the legal framework by adopting a new constitution convened by the National Constituent Assembly (NCA). During the same month UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] told officials at the <a href="http://somalikonferansi.mfa.gov.tr/default.en.mfa">Istanbul II Conference on Somalia</a> [materials] that <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/somalia-must-ensure-timely-and-peaceful-transition-to-new-constitution-un-sg.php">Somalia must take all efforts to smoothly transition</a> [JURIST report] into a permanent government with a new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.uncc.ch/">UN Compensation Commission</a> (UNCC) [official website] on Thursday announced a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43990&Cr=Iraq&Cr1=#.UQF-seilJjM">disbursement of $1.3 billion</a> [UN News Centre report] to two claimants who suffered damages during Iraq's invasion of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14644252">Kuwait</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kuwait">news archive</a>] in 1990. The two claimants were compensated for destruction of Kuwait's oil field assets. The UNCC, which was established by the UN in 1991 to process claims and pay compensation for losses and damage stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, has now awarded a total of $40.1 billion to individuals, corporations, governments and international organizations. The UNCC still has $12.3 billion worth of funds to disburse. Payments are collected from export sales of Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, in accordance with UN <a href="http://www.iamb.info/pdf/unsc1483.pdf">Security Council Resolution 1483</a> [text, PDF]. 

<p>In July the UNCC announced a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-releases-additional-funds-for-victims-of-iraq-invasion-of-kuwait.php">disbursement of $1.3 billion</a> [JURIST report] to six claimants, including corporations, public enterprises, governments, and international organizations. In June 2005, the UNCC processed its final claim, bringing the total award payments to $53.5 billion. One month prior, Iraq's deputy UN Ambassador Feisal al- Istrabadi <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/oil-for-food-investigators-uncover.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] corruption and gross mismanagement of the UN Oil-for-Food program.

Headley, a US citizen of Pakistani descent, <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MUMBAI_ATTACKS_HEADLEY?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">facilitated the attack</a> [AP report] by conducting scouting missions in Mumbai for the Pakistani-based militant group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/lashkar-e-taiba-army-pure-aka-lashkar-e-tayyiba-lashkar-e-toiba-lashkar--taiba/p17882">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder], which eventually carried out the attack. In handing down the sentence, Leinenweber noted that while life imprisonment would have been appropriate for Headley, his cooperation with prosecutors in the case against Tahawwur Rana&#8212;convicted of providing material support to the Denmark terror plot and to LeT&#8212;ultimately resulted in a lesser sentence. 

<p>Headley's sentence is the latest development in the attempt to bring those responsible for the Mumbai attack to justice. In November India executed the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/29/timeline-the-trial-of-mohammed-ajmal-kasab/">Mohammad Ajmal Kasab</a> [WSJ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kasab">news archive</a>]. On the day before Kasab's execution the Indian Supreme Court criticized the application of the <a href="/paperchase/IndiaSCt-11202012.pdf">"rarest of rare" standard</a> [judgement, PDF], which provides that the death penalty should be imposed only when the offense is "of an exceptionally depraved and heinous character and constitutes, on account of its design and and the manner of its execution, a source of grave danger to the society at large." Nonetheless, the Indian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/india-high-court-affirms-death-sentence-for-gunman-in-mumbai-attacks.php">upheld Kasab's sentence</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009, Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/pakistan-to-indict-seven-for-2008.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] seven men accused of plotting the attack under Pakistan's <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/document/actsandordinences/anti_terrorism.htm">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

This is a significant change to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=1746">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] 1994 direct ground combat definition and assignment rule that prohibits women from these serving in these roles.  Panetta said that in addition to lifting the 1994 ban, he is directing the military "to eliminate all unnecessary gender-based barriers to service." In explaining the decision, Panetta said:<blockquote>Our purpose is to ensure that the mission is carried out by the best qualified and the most capable servicemembers, regardless of gender and regardless of creed and beliefs. If members of our military can meet the qualifications for a job ... then they should have the right to serve, regardless of creed or color or gender or sexual orientation.</blockquote>Throughout his remarks, Panetta mentioned a number of times that he coordinated with top generals and the <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> [official website] in implementing this new policy.

<p>The role of women in combat missions has been a serious issue for the DOD.  In November four female service members <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/women-sue-defense-department-over-combat-exclusion.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the US Army and the DOD to end the policy which barred women from combat units and related posts, alleging the policy had limited the potential of women's careers and was a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. In January 2011 a US military panel, the Military Leadership Diversity Commission, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that women be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. Their report said that integration of women into combat forces would have no ill effects and recommended a "time-phased" approach to the implementation of new combat policies that would create additional career options for women that include "direct ground combat." These recent suits to allow women into combat roles come on the heels of another civil rights push in military policy-last year's repeal of the controversial <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. Last year Australia became the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/australia-military-to-allow-women-in-combat-roles.php">fourth nation</a> [JURIST report] to permit women to serve in combat roles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill passed by a vote of 51-19 after a lengthy debate on the House floor. Rhode Island is currently the only state in New England that has not legalized same-sex marriage, and previous attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in the predominantly Catholic state have been unsuccessful. The debate on the house floor drew strong opinions from both sides through discussions about civil rights, religion and marriage. <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText13/SenateText13/S0038.pdf">Similar legislation</a> [S 0038, PDF] has been introduced in the Senate, and Governor Lincoln Chafee has announced his support.

The first case, <span class="casename">Hollingsworth v. Perry</span>, examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights.

The bill would extend the UK's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/contents">Marriage Act of 1949</a> [materials] to apply to same-sex couples as well as opposite-sex couples. The bill also <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/01/25/uk-same-sex-marriage-bill.html">contains exceptions</a> [AP report] for clergy members who do not wish to perform same-sex weddings. Same-sex couples in England and Wales have been able to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21194052">enter into civil partnerships since 2005</a> [BBC report], giving them many of the same legal rights as married couples. Although many members of the <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">Conservative Party</a> are likely to vote against the bill, the bill is expected to pass with strong support from the <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/">Labour Party</a>, the <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/home.aspx">Liberal Democrats</a> and <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official websites]. The first parliamentary hearing on the bill is scheduled for February 5. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue around the world. On Tuesday the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">received briefs</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases defending the constitutionality of laws that define marriage as strictly between one man and one woman. Last month JURIST guest columnist Paul Johnson opined that the effect of an ongoing human rights debate in the British Isles and the European Court of Human Rights may have a <a href="/hotline/2012/12/paul-johnson-coe-homosexuality.php">detrimental effect on the same-sex marriage debate</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the UK. In the same time frame, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit corporation in Nevada which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to grant <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires Nevada to change its definition of marriage from the union of a man and a woman to the union of two persons. In November the office of the Maryland Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">released an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that same-sex couples can obtain marriage licenses, allowing Maryland to become the ninth US state to allow same sex marriage after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> [JURIST reports] enacted similar measures in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, if passed, would likely <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21194710">ban any event in Russia that promotes gay rights</a> [BBC report]. The bill would also impose stiff fines on individuals who "promote homosexuality among minors," although it does not define what this phrase means. Individuals who violate the bill would face fines of up to 5,000 rubles (USD $166), and government officials would be forced to pay up to 50,000 rubles. In order to become law, the bill must face two more readings and then be passed by the <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/">Federation Council</a>, Russia's upper house of parliament. The bill would then have to be signed into law by <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official websites, in Russian]. 

<p>In September the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/">Supreme Court of Russia</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/russia-supreme-court-gay-pride-parades-not-propaganda.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the Arkhangelsk region's ban on "gay propaganda" but ruled that gay pride parades and other demonstrations in support of gay rights are legal. In August LGBT activists brought suit over the Russian Justice Ministry's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gay-rights-activists-sue-russia-authorities-over-2014-winter-olympics-registration.php">refusal to register Pride House</a> [JURIST report] for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games. Also that month Russia's best-known gay rights activist Nikolay Alexeyev <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/moscow-court-upholds-100-year-city-ban-on-gay-pride-marches.php">lost a court challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Moscow's 100-year municipal ban on gay pride marches. He intends to appeal the decision to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which has already <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/european-court-rules-against-russia-for-ban-on-gay-rights-parades-in-moscow.php">ordered Russia to pay Alexeyev</a> [JURIST report] an award of &#8364;12,000 for non-pecuniary damages plus &#8364;17,510 for costs and attorneys fees (USD $41,090 total) for rejecting his license application for a gay pride gathering. In March St. Petersburg announced that the city's governor had signed into law a bill that would impose fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. Individuals convicted under the law would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">subject to fines between 3,000 and 5,000 rubles</a> (USD $100-160) [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], while organizations could be fined up to 50,000 rubles for "promoting" homosexuality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation collectively sought to grant unmarried couples a means of official registration as legal entities with rights including the ability to inherit property without taxation and to access protected information normally available only to married couples. Poland's first openly gay lawmaker and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/681003bc-355a-11e1-84b9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2J0XpMSDv">Palikot Movement party</a> member <a href="http://robertbiedron.pl">Robert Biedron</a> [personal website, in Polish] introduced two of the draft bills while the third was introduced by <a href="http://www.kprm.gov.pl">Prime Minister Donald Tusk</a> [official website, in Polish] of the Civic Ruling party. The proposed legislation <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/01/25/poland-rejects-proposed-gay-civil-unions/">marks the first time</a> [WSJ report] that Polish lawmakers have considered granting rights historically reserved for married couples to unmarried couples, and the issue has proven to be both contentious and polarizing. Poland's more conservative political contingent has reportedly challenged the legislation as an attack on long-standing Catholic traditions that seek to promote and incentivize family stability and procreation. Conversely, Poland's more liberal wing, including the Palikot Movement, has called for fundamental and practical fairness to unmarried couples allegedly impeded by law from resolving day-to-day issues. Polish lawmakers have expressed plans to bring new proposals before parliament in the future. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and correlated rights remain a controversial issue around the world. In November, the Polish Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/poland-supreme-court-recognizes-same-sex-relationships-for-purpose-of.php">declared for the first time</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex partners living together could retain the same legal standing as heterosexual couples in regard to taking over a lease if their romantic partner with whom they were cohabiting should die. In August Germany's Justice Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-proposes-several-marriage-rights-to-same-sex-unions.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would grant several additional marriage rights to couples in same-sex civil unions. Also in August the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-constitutional-court-rules-equal-tax-benefits-for-same-sex-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that homosexual couples in a civil union should receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual married couples. In June Denmark's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/denmark-parliament-passes-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">voted to approve a bill </a>[JURIST report] that legalized same-sex marriages in the country's state Lutheran church ceremonies when before couples were required to conduct ceremonies at the end of services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Upon agreeing to review the constitutionality of DOMA's Section 3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/elderly-woman-petitions-supreme-court-to-expedite-doma-challenge.php">report</a>], the court invited Jackson's argument on its authority to do so. The brief first examines whether the Obama administration can appeal a case that it had already won in a lower court, which held that DOMA is unconstitutional. The brief suggests that the only reason for the administration's appeal is a desire to obtain "a precedent from a higher court." However, that is not enough to satisfy Article III. Because the dispute has already been resolved, the federal government "offers no concrete injury to its legal interests ... sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court." The brief also addresses whether the House's three Republican leaders can satisfy the Constitution's Article III requirement that they have the legal standing to be DOMA's defenders in court. Jackson argues that, "because the generalized interest in the constitutionality of its statutes does not confer standing on Congress or its members, this Court's caselaw has upheld legislative standing only in situations where there is a concrete threat to the institutional prerogatives of the legislature or to the personal rights of its members." Even if the legislators could circumvent this issue, the professor claims, the interest in constitutionality "would belong to the entire Congress, not just one house. Accordingly, both houses would have to assert that injury by moving to intervene" in court. Both the Obama administration and the House leaders will be given the opportunity to file briefs next month to address Jackson's arguments.

<p>The case of <span class="casename">United States v. Windsor</span> concerns <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-thea-edie-doma">Edith Windsor</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a widow who had a legal same-sex marriage under Canadian and New York law but was denied spousal deduction for federal estate taxes when her wife died. Prior to her challenge, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend DOMA in courts</a>, and in response, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">formed</a> [JURIST reports] the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) to defend the law. In July 132 members of the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-house-members-file-court-brief-arguing-doma-unconstitutional.php"><em>amicus</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] arguing that statutory classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened judicial scrutiny and that DOMA should be overturned as unconstitutional under any level of judicial scrutiny. The brief was filed in the appeal of <span class="casename">Karen Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, the landmark case in which the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-finds-defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional.php">DOMA is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In June 10 US senators filed their own <em>amicus</em> brief in the case, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-senators-file-brief-supporting-defense-of-marriage-act.php">arguing in the opposite</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government had a legitimate interest in creating a uniform federal definition of marriage to "[avoid] massive legal uncertainty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/us-germany-internet-idUSBRE90N15H20130124">declared</a> [Reuters report] the Internet an "essential" part of life and, in accordance with German law which requires compensation for the loss of use of essential material items, victims have a right to claim damages for such infractions. Serving as a potentially landmark decision for advocates of wireless broadband expansion, the German court illustrated the importance of Internet use in today's society, comparing its loss to the loss of a car.

<p>This decision follows a more recent trend in Germany of judicial deference to consumer protection and public need. A pair of 2008 decisions by Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website] prevented a series of laws from going into effect that would have allowed intelligence agents and government officials to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/germany-constitutional-court-overturns.php">search personal computers, networks and Internet communications</a> as well as <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-high-court-blocks-data.php">telephone data</a> [JURIST reports] for national security purposes. The same court reaffirmed its defense of individual liberties in 2010 when it <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-high-court-overturns-data.php">overturned a law</a> [JURIST report] requiring telecommunications providers to store information on telephone calls, e-mails and Internet use for six months in the event of possible terrorism investigations, citing privacy issues as the main cause for concern.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report advocates for reform in various aspects of Indian life including political, judicial and cultural. The most extensive recommendation is for changing the manner in which police and the judiciary respond to rape accusations and punishments. It suggests the government should increase police accountability and impose harsher penalties for those convicted of sexual assault. Pillay stated:<blockquote>This report and its far-reaching recommendations are not only a tribute to the brave young woman who was raped and murdered five weeks ago, but to all victims of sexual violence and assault in India. It is also a testament to the power of the young women and men of India, and the broader civil society, who have joined hands across the nation to say "Enough is Enough." ... The Committee's recommendations are grounded in a framework of rights, equality and non-discrimination, and represent a paradigm shift towards recognition of women as holders of rights, not just objects of protection. The report should serve as a beacon for many other countries struggling to respect the rights of women more comprehensively by addressing sexual violence through legislation, policies and programmes.</blockquote>Pillay was referring to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765320">rape</a> and subsequent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20860569">death</a> [BBC reports] of a 23-year-old New Delhi medical student in December.

<p>The student's death sparked mass protests in India and led to the creation of the committee that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/india-panel-recommends-legal-reforms-in-response-to-rape-incident.php">issued its findings</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcanada.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/12825/1/document.do">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that common law couples do not have the same rights as married couple in Quebec. The case involves a common law couple with three children in which the mother filed suit for spousal support, "partition of the family patrimony and the legal matrimonial regime of partnership of acquests." She challenged several provisions of Quebec's Civil Code that makes distinctions between married, civil-union and de facto couples as well as their rights and obligations. The mother argued that they are inconsistent with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/index.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. In a 5-4 decision, the court rejected the mother's appeal and held that the Civil Code provisions were not unconstitutional because the province's legislature made no distinction and thus, did not discriminate against a particular group of couples. The court mainly focused on the autonomy of couples to make decisions with regards to their relationships:<blockquote>The distinction made by the law is rationally connected to the state objective: the Quebec approach only imposes state-mandated obligations on spouses who have made a conscious and active choice to accept those obligations. The law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives for maximizing choice and autonomy in the matter of family assets and support. While schemes adopted in other Canadian provinces impair the equality right of de facto  spouses to a lesser degree, such approaches would be less effective in promoting Quebec's goals of maximizing choice and autonomy for couples in Quebec ... Without this distinction, the clear choice between a regime of division of property and support on the one hand, and a regime of full autonomy on the other hand, would be absent. The Quebec approach only imposes state-mandated obligations on spouses who have made a conscious and active choice to accept those obligations. The requirement of an active choice to undertake obligations is consistent with the objective of enhancing autonomy</blockquote> Each province provides different rights and obligations to couples falling outside of the traditional group of couples. Thus, it is unclear whether other provinces will review their laws because the court's ruling was limited to the present case.

<p>The appeal stems from a Court of Appeals decision that held Quebec's <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/quebec/article/885194--quebec-woman-wins-huge-common-law-alimony-case">Civil Code provisions were unconstitutional</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] because they had discriminatory effect on common law couples. The appeals court thereby reversed the decision of Quebec Superior Court that held that the mother had failed to demonstrate the discriminatory effect caused by the Civil Code provisions. Canada and other countries around the world are currently reviewing the controversy of marriage equality&#8212;particularly <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last January Canadian <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/mag-mpg/">Justice Minister Rob Nicholson</a> [official profile] indicated that the Canadian government considers <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/canada-to-change-marriage-law-to-legally-recognize-all-non-resident-same-sex-marriages.php">all same-sex marriages performed in Canada to be legal</a> [JURIST report] and that the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Docid=3293341&file=4">Civil Marriage Act</a> [text] will be altered to reflect the government's position. The announcement came amid a growing controversy over a previous <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/canada-same-sex-marriages-of-non-residents-not-valid.php">declaration</a> [JURIST report] that non-resident same-sex marriages performed in Canada are not legal unless recognized by the participants' home countries. As it is with common law couples, Canada's provinces have interpreted rights of same-sex couples in different ways. In October 2011 a judge for the <a href="http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/CourtofQueensBench/tabid/69/Default.aspx">Queen's Court Bench of Alberta</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-court-expands-rights-of-gay-non-biological-parents.php">granted custody</a> [JURIST report] of a child to a non-biological father who was an ex-partner of the biological father. In January of that year, the <a href="http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/default.asp?pg=court_of_appeal">Saskatchewan Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/canada-appeals-court-refusal-to-marry-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that refusal by provincial marriage commissioners to marry same-sex couples is unconstitutional and thereby invalidated a proposed amendment to Saskatchewan's Marriage Act of 1995 that would have allowed the commissioners to refuse to marry same-sex couples based on their religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Obama administration argued that the president's appointment was constitutional because the Senate was on a 20-day recess when the appointments were made. However, the court, after discussing the background underlying the constitutional language "Recess," reasoned that logic, language and constitutional history supports the interpretation of "Recess" referring to "the period between sessions of the Senate when the Senate is by definition not in session and therefore unavailable to receive and act upon nominations from the President." Thus, it concluded that the <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/l1x4e2q5r2tde">Recess Appointment Clause</a> [Art. II, &#167; 5, cl. 4 text] was inapplicable in this case because the Senate was not in recess at the time of the putative appointments and the vacancies did not occur during the recess of the Senate. Consequently, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II, &#167; 2, Clause 2</a> [text] of the Constitution, the president was required to obtain the advice and consent of the Senate before the appointment. The White House may appeal the decision.

<p>The case was brought by a bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Washington state challenging the NLRB after the Board affirmed a decision that the distributor violated the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text]. In addition, two business advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/two-business-groups-challenge-obamas-recess-appointments.php">filed motions</a> contesting the constitutionality of the president's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/doj-defends-obamas-recess-appointments.php">recess appointments</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2012. The motions were filed in relation to the groups' ongoing suit challenging the NLRB mandate that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nlrb-orders-union-rights-posted-in-us-businesses.php">rights to unionize</a> [JURIST report] be posted in all workplaces. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] defended the use of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BP\W%3B%20P%20%20%0A">recess appointments</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] by Obama immediately after his announcement. The DOJ's memo argues that although the Senate met between January 3 and 23, the sessions were not sufficient to constitute an interruption of a recess under the Recess Appointment Clause because they were only pro forma sessions that lasted less than a minute and there was no intent to conduct any business. Some experts argue that recess appointments have <a href="/forum/2011/12/victor-williams-recess-appointments.php">regularly been used by presidents</a> [JURIST op-ed] since George Washington. It is only a relatively recent practice that obstructionists have begun holding perfunctory pro forma sessions every three days while the Senate is on recess in order to block recess appointments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DC Circuit <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/25/3200579/federal-court-cancels-al-qaida.html#storylink=cpy">ruled</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] that the military tribunal that convicted Al Bahlul of conspiracy in 2007 erred because a Guantanamo prisoner could not be convicted of conspiracy unless his crime took place after 2006. The court explained that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] codified conspiracy as a war crime, but did not apply to crimes committed before the MCA was passed. Al Bahlul was captured in 2001. The US has 90 days to appeal the DC Circuit's decision to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>Two weeks ago the US <a href="http://justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] asked the DC Circuit to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-the-us-department-of-2.php">reverse Al Bahlul's conviction </a> [JURIST report] because the court is bound by its decision last October to dismiss the case against bin Laden's former driver, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. In September 2011 the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/">US Court of Military Commission Review</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/military-court-upholds-sentence-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled in a 7-0 vote</a> that Al Bahlul had been properly convicted of being a propagandist and should <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-sentences-yemeni.php">spend the rest of his life in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. He previously boycotted much of his trial proceedings. Al Bahlul, a 39-year old Yemeni citizen, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/second-guantanamo-detainee-goes-on.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2008. He is alleged to have been Osama bin Laden's personal assistant and media secretary and was charged in February 2008 with conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and attacks on civilians, and providing material support for terrorism. He is accused of researching the financial impact of the 9/11 attacks and also releasing the "martyr wills" of 9/11 hijackers Muhammed Atta and Ziad al Jarrah as propaganda videos. Al Bahlul was the second detainee to go on trial at Guantanamo since the prison there opened in 2002 and is the only convicted criminal currently held at the facility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Senate passed the bill 24-16 with four Republicans joining all 20 Democrats in support. <a href="http://www.adamebbin.com/">Senator Adam Ebbin</a> (D) [official website], an openly gay lawmaker, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/va-senate-approves-bill-to-ban-government-discrimination-against-gays/2013/01/25/6915692a-671b-11e2-93e1-475791032daf_story.html">declared</a> [<em>WP</em> report] that the anti-discrimination bill would help ensure that Virginia's government stays competitive with the private sector to attract the best and brightest employees. The bill will now go to the Virginia House of Delegates, the lower legislative chamber, where Republicans hold a 67-31 super-majority. 

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation has been a controversial issue worldwide. In July UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-sexual-orientation-discrimination.php">called for an end to sexual orientation discrimination</a> [JURIST report]. In June a group of LGBT plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/tennessee-plaintiffs-to-appeal-dismissal-of-anti-discrimination-suit.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in their suit challenging a Tennessee law that bars local governments from creating anti-discrimination laws that are stricter than those of the state. The US Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (HELP) <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/senate-committee-holds-hearing-on-sexual-orientation-discrimination-bill.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] in June on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), focusing on discrimination faced by LGBT employees across the country. Earlier in June JURIST guest columnist Brynne Madway <a href="/dateline/2012/06/brynne-madway-same-sex.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the LGBT community must shift some of its focus to promoting anti-discrimination laws, noting that "only 16 states have nondiscrimination laws that include gender identity and sexual orientation." In December 2011 the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-report-details-global-violence-against-lgbt-individuals.php">released its first ever report</a> [JURIST report] on the global human rights of LGBT people. The report details LGBT people around the world being killed or enduring hate-motivated violence, torture, detention, criminalization and discrimination in jobs, health care and education because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Kiriakou was the first person in 27 years to be convicted for violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/421">Intelligence Identities Protection Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], which criminalizes the disclosure of information that identifies covert agents. The <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/kiriakou/indict.pdf">indictment</a> [text, pdf] against him states that in various emails throughout 2008 and 2009, Kiriakou identified two covert agents involved with the capture and interrogation of al-Qaeda operative <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1907462.stm">Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein</a> (also known as Abu Zubaida) [BBC profile] to journalists.

<p>The CIA has faced a number of legal challenges in the past year. Last month, the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/uk-court-refuses-to-hear-drone-strike-case.php">refused to allow</a> [JURIST report] a legal challenge to the possible role of the UK's spy agencies in aiding CIA <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=drone">unmanned drone strikes</a> [JURIST news archive] in Pakistan. This was in response to a Pakistani citizen who <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pakistan-citizen-sues-uk-foreign-office-over-intelligence-sharing-for-us-drone-strikes.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office">British Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> [official website] in order to discover the extent and lawfulness of UK government aid to US drone strikes in Pakistan. In October, JURIST guest columnist Douglas Cox opined that the <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2012/10/douglas-cox-cia-records.php">CIA should respond</a> [JURIST op-ed] to the National Archives inquiry into the CIA's destruction of detainee interrogation tapes in order to prevent any further destruction of important records. In September, JURIST Guest Columnist Tung Yin argued that Attorney General Eric Holder should have <a href="/forum/2012/09/tung-yin-holder-discretion.php">given some explanation</a> [JURIST op-ed] for his decision to refrain from prosecuting any suspects after spending years investigating the CIA's abuse of interrogation methods that led to the deaths of at least two detainees. Earlier that same month, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/dc-circuit-hears-arguments-on-aclu-request-for-information-on-drone-strikes.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether to grant a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> [5 USC &#167; 552] request by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] to obtain information from the CIA on its use of unmanned drones. Also in September, the <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Italian Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 23 former CIA officers for the 2003 <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+Italy+Kidnapping">kidnapping and rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US Secretary for Education <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/news/staff/bios/duncan.html">Arne Duncan</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ed.gov/blog/2013/01/we-must-provide-equal-opportunity-in-sports-to-students-with-disabilities/">acknowledged the critical role</a> [official blog] sports play in the school experience. He went on to say that students with disabilities should not be denied the opportunity to participate, but the essential rules of the game do not have to be altered:<blockquote>Federal civil rights laws require schools to provide equal opportunities, not give anyone an unfair head start. So schools don't have to change the essential rules of the game, and they don't have to do anything that would provide a student with a disability an unfair competitive advantage. But they do need to make reasonable modifications (such as using a laser instead of a starter pistol to start a race so a deaf runner can compete) to ensure that students with disabilities get the very same opportunity to play as everyone else. The guidance issued today will help schools meet this obligation and will allow increasing numbers of kids with disabilities the chance to benefit from playing sports.</blockquote>The directive came in response to a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-519">2010 report</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">US Government Accountability Office</a> [official website], which found that many students with disabilities were not afforded an equal opportunity to participate in athletics, and therefore may not have equitable access to the health and social benefits of athletic participation.

<p>Education and access to it in the US has several nuanced issues. For example, earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/affiliate/new-hampshire">American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://www.au.org/">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a> (AU) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/civil-rights-groups-challenge-new-hampshire-education-tax-program.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of a tuition tax-credit program designed to divert taxpayer money to private religious schools across the state. In November, Oklahoma voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/oklahoma-voters-approve-affirmative-action-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure to eliminate affirmative action programs within the state. In May, JURIST Associate Editor James Craig <a href="/dateline/2012/05/james-craig-affirmative-action.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the history of affirmative action, arguing that recent studies and case law have left affirmative action with an uncertain future. In May, the Tennessee <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tennessee-legislature-passes-abstinence-only-sex-education-bill.php">augments</a> [JURIST report] the state's abstinence-only sex education curriculum to allow parents to sue school teachers or organizations that promote "gateway sexual activity."</p>]]></content:encoded>

There have been 73 people charged overall for involvement in the disaster, and there will be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/us-egypt-court-idUSBRE90P06920130126">more verdicts announced</a> [Reuters report] on March 9. The verdicts still must be reviewed and approved by the country's top religious authority, as are all death penalty verdicts in Egypt.</p>

<p>Egypt has been plagued by protests and violence since the beginning of the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] two years ago. Nine people were <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/26/egypt-anniversary-idINDEE90N0J020130126">killed yesterday</a> [Reuters report] and 456 were injured after protestors clashed violently with police officers in protests against President Mohammed Mursi. The protestors were sparked by the protestors' belief that, two years after the revolution against former President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">Hosni Mubarak</a> began on January 25, 2011, nothing has changed and Mursi is not upholding the principles of the revolution. Earlier this week, an Egyptian rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that police abuse and torture are ongoing issues and that police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-lower-house-supports-ban-on-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">passed after a first reading</a> [JURIST report] on Friday by the lower chamber of parliament, would amend <a href="http://www.russian-offences-code.com/">Russia's Code of Administrative Law Violations</a> [text] and impose fines of up to 5,000 rubles ($160 USD) on individuals and 500,000 rubles ($16,000 USD) on organizations. HRW believes that the bill is not justified sufficiently because the European Court of Human Rights has ruled on multiple occasions that the desire to "protect" children from information about homosexuality is not actually in the best interests of children. HRW officials also worry that the bill "contributes to an atmosphere that makes violence against LGBT protesters seem acceptable." LGBT protesters gathered in at least six Russian cities to protest the bill before it was debated and were attacked in many of the cities. One LGBT activist said that he witnessed counter-protesters beating LGBT protesters and throwing snowballs, plastic bottles and cans of paint at them. He also said officers and officials who were present did nothing to stop the violence against them. To become a law, the bill must pass two more readings and be signed by <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian].

<p>Laws aimed at discriminating against and denying rights to the LGBT community have caused controversies throughout the international community. On Friday, Poland <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/poland-lawmakers-reject-civil-union-legislation.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would have given unmarried couples, including gay couples who are not allowed to marry, the ability to register to receive certain legal rights available to married couples. In October, the <a href="http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/northern-ireland-high-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that banned gay couples from adopting children. That same month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-proposed-ukraine-gay-propaganda-ban-violates-human-rights.php">warned Ukraine</a> [JURIST report] that a proposed law similar to, but more harsh than, Russia's proposed "homosexual propaganda" law would violate human rights. The proposed Ukraine law would impose fines on anyone who "promotes homosexuality," regardless of whether their audience is minors or not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban noted that while many countries have made strides to achieve the UN's eight <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs) [official website], he <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44010&Cr=African%20Union&Cr1=#.UQVzEyeH1QU">expressed concern</a> [press release] about the millions of Africans living in poverty and urged African leaders to reach the MDGs before the 2015 deadline. Ban applauded the gains of women in Africa, noting that more girls are in schools, more clinics help women survive childbirth, and more women are entering into the government. Ban noted of the economic gains African nations have achieved thus far: <blockquote>Success will depend on ownership by governments and civil society. Our destination is clear:  A future where Africa's wealth enriches all of Africa's people. Where misrule is only found in history books. Where Africa's goods get a fair price on the global market. Where global partnerships mean shared prosperity. African countries averaged a remarkable 5 per cent growth over the past decade&#8212;and are projected to grow by even more than 5 per cent by 2014. But economic expansion is not an end in itself. Wealth cannot remain in the hands of the few. Inequality is a recipe for instability.</blockquote> Regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-security-forces-killing-civilians-in-small-town-hrw.php">ongoing crisis</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881370">Mali</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">news archive</a>], Ban said the international community had a "moral imperative" to assist civilians in need. 

<p>Ban on Sunday also <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6573">spoke</a> [text] at an event for the <a href="http://pages.au.int/carmma?q=carmma">Campaign for Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa</a> (CARMMA) [official website]. He noted that one out of every two women in Africa die in childbirth. To obtain results, Ban said Africa needed resources for high-impact interventions; innovative technologies and integrated services; increased investments in women and girls; advance all the MDGs; improve education; address hunger; and overcome poverty. Ban pledged that the United Nations would do "everything possible to support and expand the CARMMA campaign" to help reach the MDGs and make motherhood safer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Saeed Abedini, 32, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-pastor-iran-idUSBRE90R00Q20130128">became a US citizen through marriage</a> [Reuters report] in 2010 and has been traveling between the US and Iran since he was ordained a minister through the <a href="http://wordpress.aeaministries.org/">American Evangelistic Association</a> [advocacy website] in 2008. This summer Iranian authorities placed Abedini on house arrest, then in September sent him to prison where he was beaten and tortured, according to the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website], which is representing Abedini's wife and two children in the US. Judge Pir-Abassi <a href="http://aclj.org/iran/lies-and-conviction-iran-mocks-justice-convicts-sentences-american-pastor-saeed">convicted and sentenced</a> [ACLJ report] Abedini after allowing his lawyer one day in court to put on a defense, which was also the only day of the trial Abedini and his lawyer were permitted to attend. The evidence provided by the prosecution was of Abedini's Christian activities in the early 2000s, when house churches were not perceived as such a threat to Iran's national security. Prior to the announcing of the verdict the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/203286.htm">condemned</a> [press release] "Iran's continued violation of the universal rights of freedom of religion" and called on the Iranian authorities to respect Adebini's human rights and release him.

<p>Abedini is only the most recent human rights advocate to be imprisoned by Iran for threatening national security. Earlier this month Iranian lawyer and prominent human rights activist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasrin+Sotoudeh">Nasrin Sotoudeh</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-human-rights-lawyer-temporarily-released-from-prison.php">temporarily released after spending over two years in prison</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran for her September 2010 conviction for propaganda and harming national security. Iranian authorities pursued Sotoudeh because she represented political activists and sought to highlight the execution of juveniles in the country. In December Sotoudeh ended a 49-day <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/iran-human-rights-lawyer-ends-hunger-strike.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in protest of her prison conditions and a travel ban imposed on her family. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay had expressed concern for Sotoudeh's deteriorating health and urged the Iranian government to lift the travel ban, saying the ban was not justified by international law. After judicial authorities agreed to lift the travel ban on Sotoudeh's daughter, Sotoudeh ended her strike. Sotoudeh was sentenced in January 2011 to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Magnitsky's defense lawyer was appointed by the court after his family and lawyers refused to attend the trial, claiming the charges against Magnitsky were <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130128/russian-court-postpones-hearing-whistleblowers-case">politically motivated</a> [Reuters report]. Magnitsky was jailed on tax evasion and fraud charges. He died while in jail in 2009, with relatives claiming that he did not receive adequate treatment for his poor health. Russian authorities maintain that Magnitsky died from a hearth attack. The court postponed Magnitsky's hearing to February 18 after his defense lawyers failed to appear in court on Monday. 

<p>In December, a Moscow court  <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/moscow-court-acquits-prison-doctor-in-death-of-russian-whistleblower.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] prison doctor Dmitry Kratov of all charges stemming from Magnitsky's. A Russian judge found that there was no evidence showing a causal link between Kratov's negligence and Magnitsky's death. Kratov was the head of medical services at Butyrka Prison, where Magnitsky died from untreated pancreatitis. An investigation conducted by Russia's Presidential Council on Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption, torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that in addition to being denied medical treatment Magnitsky had been severely beaten during his year long pretrial incarceration. Kratov was accused of negligence for allegedly refusing to respond to repeated requests by Magnitsky to treat his life-threatening condition. Magnitsky's death while in custody has caused a rift in Russia's relationship with the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Argentinian courts have <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-27/news/sns-rt-us-argentina-iranbre90q0e9-20130127_1_argentina-and-iran-interpol-arrest-warrants-foreign-minister-hector-timerman">accused Iran of sponsoring the attack</a> [Reuters report], which killed 85 people, and in 2007 Argentinian authorities secured Interpol arrest warrants for five Iranians, including current Iranian Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi. Despite strong objections by Israel, the US and the Argentinian Jewish community, Argentina Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, who is Jewish, and his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Salehi have been involved in a series of bilateral talks that began with their first meeting at the UN headquarters in New York in September. At a meeting in Ethiopia during an African Union summit, the two foreign ministers culminated their talks with the signing of a memorandum of understanding, which now needs to be ratified by the national parliament of each country. The agreement will create the independent truth commission, to be made up of five judges who are jointly nominated foreign legal experts having residency in neither Argentina nor Iran. The commission is to conduct an investigation and prepare a report with recommendations on how to proceed with the case based on the laws of each country and within the framework of international law. As part of the compact Argentinian authorities will be <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/01/28/3117941/argentina-iran-sign-agreement-on-amia-jewish-center-bombing">permitted to question the Iranian suspects</a> [JTA report] under Interpol arrest warrants, but only in Tehran. Iran rejected Argentina's proposal to put its accused citizens on trial in a neutral country in 2010. Argentinian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/">President Cristina Fernandez</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/component/content/article/141-ultimas-noticias/26336-qla-justicia-argentina-interrogara-a-sospechosos-iraniesq-afirmo-el-canciller-timerman">hailed the agreement</a> [press release, in Spanish] as a historic guarantee of due process. Argentina is home to Latin America's largest Jewish community.

<p>Earlier this week Iran drew additional ire from the US when an Iranian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-court-sentences-us-pastor-to-eight-years-in-prison.php">sentenced an American-Iranian pastor to eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for threatening national security through his leadership in Christian house churches. Earlier this month Iranian lawyer and prominent human rights activist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasrin+Sotoudeh">Nasrin Sotoudeh</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-human-rights-lawyer-temporarily-released-from-prison.php">temporarily released after spending over two years in prison</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran for her September 2010 conviction for propaganda and harming national security. Iranian authorities pursued Sotoudeh because she represented political activists and sought to highlight the execution of juveniles in the country. Last month Argentina sentenced former Interior Minister Jaime Smart to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">life in prison for crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] during the nation's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>]. In July Argentina's Poder Judicial de la Nacion <A href = "/paperchase/2012/07/argentina-sentences-former-dictators-for-kidnapping-children-during-war.php">sentenced two former Argentine dictators</a> [JURIST report] to a total of 65 years in prison for their involvement in the systematic kidnapping of babies from leftist activists detained and killed during the "Dirty War."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill will allow potential licensees to take both written and driving tests and would require them to have proof of auto insurance, which proponents advocate is a public safety measure. The licenses will last for three years and cannot be used for the purchase of firearms, to vote or to board a plane. The Illinois secretary of state's office estimates it <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-27/news/ct-met-quinn-immigrant-drivers-licenses-0128-20130129_1_licenses-illinois-illegal-immigrant-consular-identification-card">will begin issuing licenses</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] in about 10 months. Critics argued that the process is open to abuse, but Quinn <a href="http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=2&RecNum=10854">praised the bipartisanship effort</a> [press release] to pass the bill and stated that it would save lives and money by helping to ensure that immigrant motorists had passed a driving safety test. 

<p>The Illinois House <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/illinois-house-passes-bill-allowing-illegal-immigrant-drivers-licenses.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in early January after it was approved by the Senate last December. California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/-or-illegalimmigrants-or-immigration.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a similar bill in October, which directed California's Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to people who do not have a social security number but can prove they are authorized to be in the US under federal law. In contrast, Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/arizona-governor-issues-executive-order-denying-benefits-to-undocumented-immigrants.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] in August that instructs state agencies not to provide driver's licenses and other public benefits to undocumented immigrants who have gained the right to work under the new federal program known as <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">Deferred Action</a> [DHS memorandum; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">report</a>].

Clashes between Islamic and liberal factions have resulted in hundreds of injuries and at least 50 deaths since last Thursday. The Egyptian cabinet responded Monday by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21234543">approving legislation</a> [BBC report] that gives already-deployed military personnel the authority and mandate to arrest and detain alleged instigators upon the president's order. Reports indicate that arrestees will still have access to the judicial system. Protests stem from divided loyalty over Morsi's Islamic political predisposition. Liberal factions have reportedly claimed that Morsi's policies seek to supplant democratic ideals underpinning the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] while Islamic factions assert that liberals seek to undermine the revolution by violently overthrowing the nation's first democratically elected president. Nationwide unrest has reportedly compounded since an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">handed down 21 death penalties</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries. According to media sources, military personnel will oversee the state of emergency by enforcing strict nightly curfews for one month, but many Egyptian citizens have already allegedly asserted their plans to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-egypt-anniversary-idUSBRE90N1E620130128">defy the military rule</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Egypt has been plagued by protests and violence since the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution two years ago. Last week, an Egyptian rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that police abuse and torture continue to be ongoing issues and that police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. In December, Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">indefinitely halted operations</a> [JURIST report] amid pressure from protestors aiming to block judges from meeting to rule on the validity of the country's new constitution. Supporters of Morsi flooded the court and blocked the judges from entering to hear a case that would permit them to dissolve the constituent assembly that drafted the new constitution. Protests have increased since <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">Morsi signed Egypt's new constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law in December. Only 32.9 percent of Egypt's total of 52 million voters actually participated in the referendum, leading many to debate its results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants claim that they were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/28/us-usa-guantanamo-idUSBRE90R07I20130128">tortured</a> [Reuters report] during their time held in secret CIA prisons. This is one of the many issues that are set to be litigated when pretrial hearings begin Monday at the war crimes tribunal taking place at the Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base in Cuba. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive], who is accused of planning the 9/11 plane attacks, is among the defendants set to stand trial. Lawyers for the defendants have requested documents from the White House and Department of Justice (DOJ) that authorize the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to move suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] members across borders after the 9/11 attacks and keep them in secret prisons for interrogations. Defense lawyers plan to argue that the defendants were subjected to illegal pre-trial punishment. The prosecution maintains that it will not be using any information in trial that was obtained through torture or other techniques that violate US and international law.

<p>Last week the US Department of Defense (DOD) announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-department-of-defense-declines-to-drop-conspiracy-charge-against-accused-911-plotters.php">not withdraw charges of conspiracy</a> [JURIST report] against the five accused plotters of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Defense counsel for accused 9/11 conspirators filed a motion requesting that the court find that the US constitution was "presumed to apply" in the proceedings, and that the prosecution must bear the burden of proving that any particular provision did not apply. Colonel James Pohl ruled that the request presented a nonjusticiable issue because the Commission cannot rule on hypothetical legal questions that do not aver "real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief" relating to actual historical fact. In a separate case, counsel for accused USS Cole bomber, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] filed a motion to dismiss alleged violations of the Military Commissions Act in August 2012 on grounds that the bombing occurred "prior to the commencement of hostilities" between the US and al Qaeda.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Congress on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-congress-approves-bill-granting-compensation-to-human-rights-victims.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] allocating 10 billion pesos (USD $246 million) for the victims of human rights abuses committed by the regime of former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Ferdinand+Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> [JURIST news archive]. Approximately 10,000 people can claim compensation based on abuses that took place between when Marcos instated martial law in 1972 until he was overthrown in 1986. Under the new bill a nine-member compensation board <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/292359/news/nation/congress-oks-bicam-report-compensating-human-rights-victims-during-marcos-regime?ref=related_stories">appointed by</a> [GMA report] <a href="http://1.president.gov.ph/">President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website], comprised of members a number of Filipino human rights, will evaluate claims of human rights victims and award reparations to those who qualify. 

<p>The Philippines has struggled in terms of addressing human rights issues from the Marcos regime to as recently as the 2009 <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">Maguindanao Massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] and the resulting political controversies. Earlier this month a 150-day <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-begins-150-day-gun-ban-to-prevent-election-violence.php">ban on guns</a> [JURIST report] was instituted to prevent election violence. In December the Philippine Congress <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-president-signs-law-criminalizing-enforced-disappearances.php">officially criminalized</a> [JURIST report] enforced disappearances, which were commonly used during the Marcos era. In November <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called on the Philippines to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/stronger-protection-for-witnesses-of-2009-philippines-massacre-is-necessary-ai.php">protect witnesses</a> [JURIST report] in the Maguindanao Massacre trial.

UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.mv/v3/?p=minister">Ahmed Shaheed</a> [official website] stated that the execution of Mohammad Ali Amouri, Sayed Jaber Alboshoka, Sayed Mokhtar Alboshoka, Hashem Shabain Amouri and Hadi Rashidi is unacceptable. They have been sentenced on charges of enmity against God, corruption on earth and causing propaganda against the government. He reasoned that individuals should not be sentenced to death "for exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression, and affiliation to minority groups and to cultural institutions." Another expert stressed that because Iran is a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], the Iranian government is obligated to respect the rights it is currently infringing upon. The statement came amid a ruling by the Supreme Court of Iran upholding the death sentences against the five individuals. The activists were arrested in 2011, and there have been allegations that they were subject to torture and other ill-treatment while in detention.

<p>Iran's human rights record has been under international scrutiny. In October Shaheed stated in a report to the UN General Assembly that the Iranian government is <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and threatening the activists' families with rape or death. In the same month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">urged the country to halt all executions</a> [JURIST report] because the government had failed to provide the accused with fair trials and due process of law. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them fair trials. The three UN Special Rapporteurs further stated that there is no transparency to Iranian court proceedings and that the death penalty should be reserved for only the most serious of crimes. In November 2011 the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-committee-concerned-about-iran-human-rights-standards.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the protection of individuals' rights in Iran, including the frequency of the use of the death penalty. In January 2011, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ruteere noted that a successful campaign against racial discrimination and intolerance would only be achieved by "clear and more visible political leadership in combating racism and xenophobia." The statement came after Ruteere's visit to Spain in which he found that the economic crisis in Spain has been one of the causes for scapegoating vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and minority groups such as the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/feature-stories/europes-roma-community-still-facing-massive-discrimination-20090408">Roma</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Roma">news archive</a>]. He also noted that the government should take measures to prevent any reversal of progress in the fight against racism and warned the government that failure to combat racial discrimination may result in violence against the affected groups. The minority groups now attacked have been subject to high rate of unemployment, housing challenges and violence. The expert called the government to address the working and living conditions of the migrants by finding comprehensive, long-term solutions.

<p>Racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance are problems affecting not only Spain but also other countries around the globe. In July Ruteere <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-expert-calls-for-international-prevention-of-racial-discrimination.php">called on the international community</a> [JURIST report] to be wary of signs of racism that could lead to escalated conflicts and human rights violations. In April the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/denmark-failed-to-investigate-racist-attack-against-iraqi-family-un.php">published</a> [JURIST report] an opinion that Danish authorities failed to examine possible racist motivations behind an attack on an Iraqi refugee family in Denmark in 2004. Iraqi-born Mahali Dawas, his wife and eight children were attacked in June 2004 in their home in Denmark by up to 35 Danish young people who beat Dawas and his son, damaged the home and shouted racist phrases at the family. In the same month, <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/start-debut-eng.html">Statistics Canada</a> [official website] reported that both the number and rate of <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/jurist-statistics-canada-official-website.php">police-reported hate crimes declined</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by 18 percent from the previous year. Significantly, the reported crimes stemming from race or ethnicity decreased by 20 percent while those motivated by religion decreased by 17 percent. More than half of all reported hate crimes, however, were found to be motivated by race. During the same week, a group of minorities in France filed a lawsuit alleging police searches are <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/france-minorities-file-racial-profiling-lawsuit.php">conducted on the basis of racial profiling</a> [JURIST report], according to a statement made by their lawyers and the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website]. The suit alleged that French police unfairly single out minority race individuals for searches and identification checks. Earlier this month, a three-judge panel of the US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-affirmative-action-ban.php">supported a ban on affirmative action</a> [JURIST report] by upholding a 1996 amendment to the California Constitution that bars preferential treatment for "any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The framework focuses on four "pillars" that the legislation will include: creating a path to citizenship for current unauthorized immigrants, contingent upon securing the borders; reforming the immigration system to ease the way for immigrants who will bolster the US economy or are a part of an existing US family and have been waiting for citizenship; creating a new employment verification system to check immigration status; and allowing immigrants to legally imigrate to the US for low-skilled labor, only if it is available and American workers have refused the work. Senators <a href = "http://www.schumer.senate.gov/">Chuck Schumer</a>, <a href = "http://www.mccain.senate.gov">John McCain</a>, <a href = "http://durbin.senate.gov">Dick Durbin</a>, <a href = "http://www.menendez.senate.gov/">Robert Menendez</a> and <a href = "http://www.rubio.senate.gov">Marco Rubio</a> [official websites] revealed the outline in a press conference.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney stated in his <a href = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/28/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-1282013">press briefing</a> [transcript] Monday that "[T]he President welcomes the efforts by the bipartisan group in the Senate to put forward principles on the need for comprehensive immigration reform&#8212;principles that mirror the President's blueprint." President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement on immigration reform on Tuesday.

<p>The individual senators involved in building the framework released several statements on what the eventual legislation will include. McCain <a href = "http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=82b56b33-0e30-667d-596f-8822f3ca36d6&Region_id=&Issue_id=">focused on border security</a> [press release], "Greater focus needs to be paid to drug traffickers and criminals that cross the border. ... To combat this, we need to continue to invest in UAVs, radar, and other proven surveillance systems that will give Border Patrol the ability to detect and apprehend all illegal entries into the United States." He also <a href = "http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=82b06c86-d403-2a4f-7b86-e59912bf5489&Region_id=&Issue_id=">compared the framework to failed legislation</a> [FAQ text] that was put forward in 2007, and issued more details about the plan, including that funding for some aspects of the program will come from "fees collected from immigrant workers&#8212;both new guest workers and the previously undocumented." These funds will be used for "registering the undocumented, processing visas and other applications, enhancing enforcement and providing English and civics education to immigrants." Senator <a href = "http://lgraham.senate.gov">Lindsey Graham</a> [official website], who was not available for the press conference, also released a <a href = "http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=82caa771-c9e4-b92b-b5c1-b31da60de8d7&Region_id=&Issue_id=">statement</a> [press release] and said, "We're a long way from having legislative language but I do believe 2013 presents us the best chance to pass immigration reform in many years."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled that Ophelia Azriel De'lonta, an inmate suffering from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002495/">gender identity disorder</a> (GID) [NIH backgrounder], has sufficiently stated a claim that the <a href="http://www.vadoc.state.va.us">Virginia Department of Correction</a> (VDOC) [official website] may have been deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need by refusing to evaluate her for surgery. Previously, the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2553534673493480242&q=%22330+F.3d+630%22&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that the VDOC had wrongfully prevented De'lonta from receiving any GID treatment in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder]. In Monday's ruling, the court clarified its holding:<blockquote>We hold only that De'lonta's Eighth Amendment claim is sufficiently plausible to survive screening pursuant to 28 USC &#167; 1915A. We do not decide today the merits of De'lonta's claim. Nor, for that matter, do we mean to suggest what remedy De'lonta would be entitled to should she prevail. In our view, the answers to those questions have no bearing on whether De'lonta has stated a claim that Appellees have been deliberately indifferent to her serious medical need by refusing to evaluate her for surgery, consistent with the [Benjamin] Standards of Care.</blockquote>Following De'lonta's first suit, the VDOC provided De'lonta with GID treatment consisting of regular psychological counseling and hormone therapy. De'lonta has also been permitted to dress and live like a woman to the full extent permitted by the VDOC. However, she has not been allowed to seek evaluation for gender reassignment surgery. The case has been remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's findings.

<p>Although an increasing number of prisons recognize GID as a compelling medical ailment that requires treatment, sometimes to the extent of gender reassignment surgery, the issue is still contentious. In September the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rules-sex-reassignment-medically-necessary-for-inmate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an inmate serving life without parole must be granted gender reassignment surgery as it is the only possible treatment for her GID. In March the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-hormone-therapy-for-transgender-inmates.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] on a similar case, letting stand a lower court decision that found hormone therapy for transgender inmates to be medically necessary. The standing decision from the Seventh Circuit was <a href="/hotline/2011/09/transgender-inmates-the-law-of-effective-medical-care.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST comment] by JURIST contributor <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/about/staff/johnknight/">John Knight</a> [professional profile], who suggested that laws and regulations against transgender therapy are "blatantly discriminatory" due to "popular biases being put ahead of medical research, singling out a small group of inmates, and blocking medical treatments necessary only for them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

At least 50 people have been killed since protesters took to the streets to commemorate the second anniversary of the start of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that toppled former president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>]. In addition to the numerous deaths and injuries, Pillay brought attention to the dozens of women who have been sexually assaulted in Cairo over the past week. Pillay expressed concern over the current instability in the country:<blockquote>As the tragic events over the past few days have shown, Egypt remains extremely fragile and unstable, and I urge the Government to make a much stronger effort to accommodate opposing points of view, and take concrete actions to address public concerns. This is necessary to increase nationwide participation and ownership of the constitutional, institutional, economic and legal reforms. Each missed opportunity to reach national consensus, and each example of excessive use of force by security forces, is aggravating an already frighteningly tense and volatile situation.</blockquote>The High Commissioner specifically urged <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] to listen to and communicate with opposition groups, emphasizing a need for solutions to issues surrounding the country's newly adopted constitution and concerns over the judiciary system

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the beginning of the revolution. Earlier this week, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in cities along the Suez Canal, including Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. This came a day after nationwide unrest compounded following an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death penalties</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries. Last week an Egyptian rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that police abuse and torture continue to be ongoing issues and that police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court was forced to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">indefinitely halt operations</a> [JURIST report] in December amid pressure from protesters attempting to block judges from entering the court. The protesters, supporters of Morsi, flooded the court and blocked the judges to prevent them from hearing a case challenging the validity of the new constitution. Protests in the country have been increasing since <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">Morsi signed the new constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law earlier that month. Many individuals and rights groups have questioned the validity of the constitution, as only 32.9 percent of Egypt's total of 52 million voters actually participated in the referendum to approve it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investors had sued the SEC under the waiver of sovereign immunity in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> [28 USC &#167; 2680] that allows a claim based on the performance of or failure to perform a discretionary function of a federal agency. The three-judge panel affirmed the April 2010 decision of the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website], which dismissed the lawsuit for lack of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/subject_matter_jurisdiction">subject matter jurisdiction</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The original complaint contained more than 50 pages of allegations summarizing the SEC's failure to uncover Madoff's Ponzi scheme, many of them based on the SEC Office of Inspector General's 450-page <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2009/oig-509.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Investigation of Failure of the SEC to Uncover Bernard Madoff's Ponzi Scheme - Public Version" and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/sec-inspector-general-report-details.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in August 2009. The court rejected claims that negligence on the part of the SEC "caused Madoff's scheme to continue, perpetuate, and expand" because the SEC retains discretion to decide how to conduct its investigations, meaning there are no mandatory obligations requiring the SEC to bring an enforcement action in any particular situation:<blockquote>Many of Plaintiffs' allegations (including the factual averments contained in the Report) identify decisions that, in hindsight, could have and should have been made differently. Other allegations reveal the SEC's sheer incompetence in regulating Madoff's broker-dealer, market-making, and investment-management operations. What is lacking in the present Complaint, however, is any plausible allegation revealing that the SEC violated its clear, non-discretionary duties, or otherwise undertook a course of action that is not potentially susceptible to policy analysis.</blockquote>The Ninth Circuit's three-paragraph opinion affirmed the district court's "reasoned finding" in brief fashion, disposing of the appeal by adopting verbatim nearly 80 pages of the lower court's original order.

<p>Madoff's scheme is believed to have defrauded investors of over $65 billion. Last July the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved the first payouts</a> [JURIST report] to Madoff's victims. Madoff trustee Irving Picard <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">filed almost 60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010, including suits against large banks like JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. Judge Louis Stanton made Picard the trustee of Bernard L Madoff Securities, LLC in December 2008. Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison for securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud in March 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Miguel Angel Galvez <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21238765">announced</a> [BBC report] that Montt, along with one of his former generals Jose Rodriguez Sanchez, must answer for the alleged crimes committed during Montt's reign as de facto head of state in the early 1980s. Human Rights Watch Americas Director Jose Miguel Vivanco <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/28/guatemala-rios-montt-trial-milestone-justice">called</a> [HRW press release] the order "a remarkable development in a country where impunity for past atrocities has long been the norm," and welcomed this step toward greater accountability in Guatemala. Montt is the first ex-head of state to be charged with genocide by a Latin American court. 

<p>This is not the first time Montt has been ordered to stand trial for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity. In May Judge Carol Patricia Flores <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">issued the second order</a> [JURIST report] demanding Montt stand trial after ruling that a sufficient amount of evidence had been mounted against him, necessitating his testimony before a court of law.

In the statement, Bensouda urged Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last week that her office has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/news%20and%20highlights/Pages/pr869.aspx">launched an investigation</a> [press release] into possible war crimes committed in Mali. Bensouda said, "I remind all parties to the on-going conflict in Mali that my Office has jurisdiction over all serious crimes committed within the territory of Mali, from January 2012 onwards. All those alleged to be responsible for serious crimes in Mali must be held accountable."

<p>Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently regarding political violence and alleged human rights abuses. On Friday the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] issued a report saying that the tumultuous situation in Mali has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-mali-turmoil-has-led-to-human-rights-violations.php">led to human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. Last week the interim president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. The prime minister of Mali, Cheick Modibo Diarra, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-prime-minister-of.php">forced to resign</a> [JURIST report] in December on state television after junta soldiers arrested him for attempting to leave the country in light of the ongoing humanitarian crisis threatening the nation. In September Human Rights Watch reported that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">recruiting child soldiers</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems.

The court held that the disclosure provisions of three legislative acts that required certain job applicants to disclose all minor crimes, including those committed as a juvenile, were incompatible with <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art8">Article 8</a> of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The case was brought to the appeals court by the UK rights group <a href="http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/index.php">Liberty</a> [advocacy website], which intervened on behalf of a 21-year-old man who was forced to disclose in applications that he received a warning from police when he was 11 years old in connection with two stolen bicycles. The requirement was also heavily criticized by other civil rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (EHRC) [advocacy website], another intervener in the case. In response to the ruling the EHRC's chief legal officer <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/news/2013/january/ehrc-helps-student-wrongly-branded-a-criminal-win-privacy-case/">praised the decision</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Many of us have been in minor trouble with the law as children, which we regret at the time but we would not expect that to affect our ability to get a job later in life. However, if the police and other bodies can pass on this information without our knowledge it will have serious implications for our lives and careers.This is an important ruling to establish how the authorities deal with confidential information they hold which could have a negative impact on people's lives. ... The fact that the Court has made a declaration of incompatibility indicates the seriousness of the contravention of human rights obligations in this case, which Parliament must now correct without delay.</blockquote>The UK government, however, was "disappointed" in the decision, claiming that the it compromises the "protection of children and vulnerable groups," and it <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21245308">plans to appeal</a> [BBC report] to the Supreme Court.

<p>Civil rights remain an important and controversial issue in the UK. Last week, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-government-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would extend marriage rights to same sex couples, and it is expected that the bill will pass next month. Earlier that week, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association Maina Kiai <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-urged-to-amend-laws-impacting-right-to-assembly.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UK to review certain legal and policing policies that negatively affect the right to peaceably assemble. Earlier this month, the UK took on the prosecution of a human rights case when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icj-urges-nepal-government-to-cooperate-with-uk-in-torture-investigation.php">arrested a Nepal Army colonel</a> [JURIST report] on charges of torture during Nepal's 2005 civil war. The UK will be investigating these allegations against him, and the UN has urged Nepal to work with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order, which was established in 1988 when the the military government came into power, has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21244796">criticized</a> [BBC report] by the international community as a tool to suppress dissent. Though enforcement of the order has been softened over the past several years, the government decided to completely abolish under Article 447 of the <a href="http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs5/Myanmar_Constitution-2008-en.pdf">Myanmar Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which provides that rules and regulations that predate the 2008 constitution "shall remain in operation in so far as they are not contrary to this Constitution until and unless they are repealed or amended by the Union Government." The government found the order incompatible with the constitutional protection of freedom of expression and passed Order No. 3/2013 reversing the ban. 

<p>Tuesday's announcement is the latest in a series of reform efforts under Sein. Earlier this month Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/myanmar-repeals-junta-law-for-sentencing-dissidents.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] a 1996 law enacted under which dissidents could be sentenced for up to 20 years for delivering speeches that threatened peace and stability. In December Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20856701">announced</a> [BBC report] that it would permit privately owned newspapers for the first time in 50 years beginning in April. In conjunction with a visit by US President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archive] in November Myanmar announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-the-government-of-myanmar.php">releasing a number of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report].

Under <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28mng4j245ugo2tkeska34eq45%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-III-8">Article 3, Section 8 of the Michigan Constitution</a> [text], the governor can request an advisory opinion from the supreme court as to the constitutionality of legislation once it has been enacted, provided that it is prior to the effective date of the legislation. Specifically, Snyder has requested that the supreme court determine 1) whether the law is constitutional as applied to the classified state civil service, 2) if the law does not apply to classified to state civil service, whether it violates equal protection of the law, 3) whether the law violates equal protection of the law because the legislation does not apply to all employees in the public or private bargaining units, and 4) whether the law represents a change in purpose as enacted under the Michigan constitution. In his letter, Snyder noted the time sensitive nature of his request given that collective bargaining agreements with state workers expire at the end of the year. 

<p>The request by Snyder is the latest development in the ongoing battle over collective bargaining rights in Michigan. The right to work law has been controversial since its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-lawmakers-approve-freedom-to-work-bill.php">passage</a> [JURIST report] in December, over unanimous Democratic opposition. In addition to the governor's request for an advisory opinion, two lawsuits have been <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121212/POLITICS02/212120358">filed</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report] challenging the law's passage as a violation of the Open Meetings Act. JURIST guest columnist Susan Bitensky of the Michigan State University College of Law <a href="/forum/2013/01/susan-bitensky-rtw-michigan.php">criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed] Michigan's right to work law as a bill that will "weaken the people and families who depend upon the benefits and protections negotiated by labor unions." Measures to strengthen collective bargaining rights in Michigan have also been controversial. In September the Michigan supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report], a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure was ultimately <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">defeated</a> [AP report] 57-43 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A criminal court in Cairo <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-court-sentences-8-christians-to-death-in-symbolic-trial-over-anti-islam-film.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] the convicted defendants in November, pending the final verdict just <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-29/egypt-upholds-death-penalty-for-christians-over-anti-islam-film">announced</a> [Bloomberg report]. The death sentences are primarily symbolic, as all of the defendants live outside of Egypt. The eight defendants include Mark Basseley Youssef, the California man who produced the film, as well as Florida pastor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=terry+jones">Terry Jones</a> [JURIST news archive], who aroused controversy last year by publicly burning a Koran. The film depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud and a womanizer. The court found the defendants guilty of subverting national unity, spreading false information and insulting Islam, charges that carry the death penalty in Egypt.  

<p><em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has generated a great deal of political, religious and legal controversy. In September an actress who claims she was duped into appearing in the film <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/actress-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-anti-islam-film-film-from-youtube.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] requesting that the film be removed from YouTube. Earlier in September UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/SRFreedomAssemblyAssociationIndex.aspx">Maina Kiai</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-condemns-violent-protests-over-anti-islam-film.php">condemned the violence</a> [JURIST report] that erupted after the film's release. Kiai stated that protests and rallies must be peaceful to be protected by international human rights law and urged the Middle East states to prosecute those responsible for the violence. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-violence-over-anti-islam-film.php">urged religious and political leaders</a> [JURIST report] to encourage an end to the violence that followed the release of the film.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that BP pleaded guilty to 14 criminal counts, including felony manslaughter arising out of the deaths of 11 crewmen, as well as obstructing Congress and violating the Clean Water and Migratory Bird Treaty Acts. BP was also sentenced to pay $4 billion in criminal fines and penalties, with more than $2 billion of the settlement money going directly to the Gulf region. Holder praised the plea agreement and emphasized the significance of the result:<blockquote>Today's guilty plea and sentencing represent a significant step forward in the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to seek justice on behalf of those affected by one of the worst environmental disasters in American history. I'm pleased to note that more than half of this landmark resolution - which totals $4 billion in penalties and fines, and represents the single largest criminal resolution ever - will help to provide direct support to Gulf Coast residents as communities throughout the region continue to recover and rebuild.</blockquote>BP has also been placed on probation for five years and was ordered to take prophylactic measures to prevent future incidents, including the retention of a process safety and risk management monitor, an independent auditor and an ethics monitor to oversee safety and improve the company's code of conduct.

<p>Tuesday's ruling was the most recent development in a long series of legal battles that have arisen from the Deepwater Horizon Crisis. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Deepwater Inc.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [EPA summary] and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill.

However, the court <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/30/uk-shell-nigeria-lawsuit-idUKBRE90T0DC20130130">dismissed four other claims</a> [Reuters report] brought by farmers and fishermen, along with <a href="http://www.milieudefensie.nl/">Friends of the Earth Netherlands</a> [advocacy website, in Dutch], against Shell seeking damages for lost income from pollution by oil pipelines and oil spills spanning back to 2004. Shell said the case would not set precedent because the parent company was not held liable, but the ruling could make it possible for other Nigerians to file lawsuits against Shell in the Netherlands. While the court accepted Shell's argument that sabotage caused the spills, it found that Shell should have prevented the sabotage at one of the facilities. Shell has said it would negotiate the amount of damages, but that appeals might postpone the negotiations. Both sides have three months to file an appeal.

<p>In October the four Nigerian residents and an advocacy group told the Dutch court that Shell <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/nigeria-residents-sue-shell-in-netherlands-for-oil-spills.php">should be held liable</a> [JURIST report] for damage from oil pollution in the Niger Delta. The suit was the first time a Dutch company has been sued for the alleged misconduct of its foreign subsidiary. Similar pollution lawsuits against Shell are pending in the US and the UK. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in-corporate-liability-case-from-last-term.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kiobel">news archive</a>] in October. The court heard new arguments on whether three oil companies, including Shell, are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] for alleged torture and international law violations that took place overseas. The court initially <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">heard arguments</a> last February and then directed the parties to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rehear-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-human-rights-violations.php">file briefs on a new question</a> [JURIST reports] for this term, which asked if the ATS can ever be used against against non-state citizens for atrocities committed in that state, and under what circumstances. In the UK, 35 Nigerian villages brought a suit against Shell in a London court in March, alleging Shell's slow response in <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/nigeria-villages-sue-shell-in-uk-court-over-oil-spills.php">cleaning up two oil spills</a> [JURIST report] in a Nigerian river ruined their livelihoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The council had planned to begin its review of Israel's human rights record on Tuesday, as part of a two-week session in which the council is scheduled to evaluate the record of 14 nations. The evaluations are conducted regularly for all nations, according to the UN. Upon Israel's failure to appear for its review, the council issued a statement expressing disappointment in the country's decision and urging the Israeli government to resume participation in the evaluation. The council rescheduled Israel's evaluation for its next session, which will take place later this year. 

<p>Israel has been criticized recently for potential human rights violations, particularly with respect to the conflict in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaza">Gaza</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last Month Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes.php">accused the Israeli Defense Forces of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] after a November aerial bombing raid killed 12 civilians in Gaza.

Hathaway is expected to be sentenced on May 28.

<p>The charges were <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-prosecutors-file-charges-against-michigan-supreme-court-justice.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month as a result of a Detroit news <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/did-michigan-supreme-court-justice-play-a-shell-game-to-get-out-from-underwater-home">investigative report</a> [WXYZ report]. Judicial corruption has become a growing issue internationally. In October the UN called on nations around the world to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">combat judicial corruption</a> [JURIST report], stating that it is a human rights issue because it can deprive people of their due process rights. It also said keeping the judiciary free from corruption is critical to "strengthen judicial credibility and independence." In 2010 the <a href="http://www.worldjusticeproject.org/">World Justice Project</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-releases-inaugural-rule-of-law-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] ranking countries by their adherence to rule of law, which used factors such as level of corruption, rights and access to judicial remedies. The results of the report showed a trend that rule of law was lacking more in poorer countries than it was in countries with stronger economies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ex-governor was originally <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/videogallery/74216939/Video-Ex-Gov-Ryan-reaches-halfway-house">sent to a Chicago halfway house</a> early Wednesday morning but was <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-george-ryan-arrives-at-halfway-house-20130130,0,1397840.story">released</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> reports] within hours after his arrival. According to the <a href="http://www.bop.gov/">Federal Bureau of Prisons</a> [official website], Ryan did not receive preferred treatment in order to be released to his home, and there is no requirement to spend a minimum amount of time at the halfway house. Rather, the amount of such time is based on the offender's needs, including financial and family support, an approved release residence and health issues. To date, Ryan has completed more than five years of his sentence at the <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tha/index.jsp">Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana</a> [BOP backgrounder] for multiple convictions of corruption and fraud in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred during his term as Illinois Secretary of State.

<p>In August the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-illinois-ex-governors-appeal-for-release.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's denial of a motion submitted by the former Illinois governor seeking his release from prison. In April the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-orders-appeals-court-to-reconsider-illinois-ex-governor-ryans-appeal.php">ordered</a> the circuit court to reconsider Ryan's appeal in light of <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-rules-appeals-court-can-raise-timeliness-defense.php">Wood v.

Ryan <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-illinois-governor-ryan-issues.php">issued his first public apology</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 for the crimes that resulted in his imprisonment. In November 2007 he was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/former-illinois-governor-heads-to.php">sent to a federal prison</a> to serve a <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-illinois-governor-sentenced-to.php">six-and-a-half-year sentence</a>  stemming from several <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/breaking-news-former-illinois-governor.php">convictions of corruption and fraud</a> [JURIST reports].

If Samsung was found to have willfully infringed Apple's patents, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion jury verdict</a> [JURIST report] against it could have been increased up to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284">triple that amount</a> [35 USC &#167; 284 text]. The judge's ruling partially abrogates the jury verdict, which had found that Samsung willfully infringed five of Apple's seven asserted patents. However, the judge declined to overturn the jury's findings on validity and infringement and also refused to grant Samsung a new trial on the grounds that the trial was allegedly manifestly unfair. The judge also <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1890463/2198.pdf">declined</a> [opinion, PDF] to grant Samsung a new trial last month based upon alleged juror misconduct by the jury foreman. Samsung had <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/17/3778968/samsungs-jury-foreman-misconduct-argument-will-not-result-in-a-new">alleged</a> [The Verge report] that the jury foreman hid the fact that he had been involved in a lawsuit against a company that Samsung had recently acquired a controlling interest in and that he had revealed in post-trial interviews that he improperly swayed the jury.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. Last month Apple agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/apple-withdraws-patent-claim-against-samsung.php">withdraw claims</a> [JURIST report] against a Samsung product that Samsung asserts has never been sold in the US in the second of the two <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">patent infringement cases</a> [case materials] taking place in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. That same month, a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction </a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-L700ZKASPR">Galaxy Nexus</a> [product backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Istvan Horvath and Andras Kiss, two Roma men from the town of Nyiregyhaza, filed their claim 2006, stating that they were discriminated against and isolated from mainstream education, hindering their prospects of higher education and employment. The court agreed with these allegations, stating that many Roma children are misdiagnosed with mental disabilities due to the outdated and culturally-biased nature of testing. "The schooling arrangements for Roma applicants with allegedly mild mental disability or learning disability were not attended by adequate safeguards that would ensure that...the State took into account their special needs as members of a disadvantaged class." The court ordered Hungary to pay the pair's legal costs, but the applicants did not seek damages on grounds of discrimination.

<p>Roma continue to be targets of discrimination in Europe. In September <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] urged Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-still-discriminating-against-roma.php">change its discriminatory policies</a> [JURIST report] against the country's Roma. In August AI <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ai-hungary-must-do-more-to-protect-roma-communities.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Hungary to protect the nation's Roma communities from anti-Roma attacks. Also in August the UN urged the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-experts-urge-wider-acceptance-of-roma-communities.php">end discrimination against Roma</a> [JURIST report]. In May the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] implored the government of Moldova to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/moldova-pushed-by-un-to-adopt-anti-discrimination-law.php">adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law</a> [JURIST report] that protects, amongst other groups, the Roma people.

Judge John Corbett O'Meara found that last year's Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">Miller v. Alabama</a> [JURIST report], which held that mandatory life sentences for juveniles constituted cruel and unusual punishment, should apply retroactively to juveniles sentenced before that decision. In the opinion, O'Meara wrote:<blockquote>In this case, each of the Plaintiffs was tried as an adult and convicted of first-degree murder. As a result, they received mandatory life sentences. Pursuant to statute, the parole board lacks jurisdiction over anyone convicted of first-degree murder. This statutory scheme combines to create life without parole sentences for those who committed their crimes as juveniles. This type of sentencing scheme is clearly unconstitutional under <span class="casename">Miller</span>.</blockquote>The ruling focused on the constitutionality of a <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ctn3kr45ksbnxc45c1nvsluw))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectname=mcl-791-234">parole statute</a> [text] that imposed mandatory life sentences for certain offenses. Under the court's decision the plaintiffs will now be eligible for parole. 

<p>In November the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/michigan-court-rules-ban-on-life-without-parole-for-minors-does-not-apply-retroactively.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that <span class="casename">Miller</span> did not apply retroactively. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] wrote a letter to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-group-asks-pennsylvania-governor-to-veto-juvenile-life-sentence-bill.php">asking him to veto</a> [JURIST report] legislation which would maintain the sentence of life without parole as an option for child offenders. In June the US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in two combined cases, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/miller-v-alabama/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Miller v. Alabama</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jackson-v-hobbs/">Jackson v. Hobbs</a> [SCOTUS backgrounders] that mandatory life sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. Some observers have argued that the reasoning the court used in this case <a href="/dateline/2012/06/elizabeth-imbarlina-juvenile-parole.php">could easily be extended</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the future to abolish life in prison without the possibility of parole sentences for all juvenile homicide cases. JURIST Guest Columnist Perry Moriearty of the University of Minnesota Law School recently argued that the <span class="casename">Miller</span> decision marks an important step toward <a href="/forum/2012/09/perry-moriearty-juvenile-justice.php">restoring principles of rehabilitation</a> [JURIST op-ed] to the juvenile justice system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He expressed concern over the increasing number of civilians killed by Israeli forces in the occupied <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=west+bank">West Bank</a> [JURIST news archive]. It was reported that since November eight civilians, including three minors, have been killed by the use of live ammunition. Rawley urged the government to conduct "timely, thorough, independent and impartial" investigations into the incidents and to hold those responsible for the deaths accountable. He stressed that the right to peaceful protest must be respected and strict measures must be taken to keep the protests non-violent and avoid further casualties.

<p>Israel has been criticized recently for potential human rights violations, particularly with respect to the conflict in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaza">Gaza</a> [JURIST news archive]. On Tuesday the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] expressed regret that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-council-calls-on-israel-to-resume-participation-in-human-rights-review.php">Israeli government failed to send</a> [JURIST report] a representative to the Council's review of Israel's human rights record. Last month <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes.php">accused the Israeli Defense Forces of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] after a November aerial bombing raid killed 12 civilians in Gaza. Earlier that week UN Special Rapporteur Richard Flak <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] pressured <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">Israel to avoid strikes</a> [JURIST report] on civilian structures in Gaza. In August Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its treatment of Palestinian detainees, alleging that two had been mistreated. In June the UN also urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-aid-groups-urge-israel-to-end-gaza-blockade.php">end its blockade</a> [JURIST report] of the Gaza Strip, alleging that it was violating international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/1/31/worldupdates/russian-court-orders-pussy-riot-videos-be-banned-from-internet&sec=Worldupdates">deemed</a> [Reuters report] the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government "extremist." Critics claim that the ban is violating the group's free speech rights. However, President Vladimir Putin argues that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population. Band member Yekaterina Samutsevich was <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20130130/266242415.html">denied access to the appeal proceedings</a> [RAPSI report] because the court did not recognize her as an interested party.

<p>Earlier this month a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-sentencing-deferral-for-imprisoned-feminist-rocker.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a sentencing deferral for band member Maria Alekhina, despite her having a young child. In October, Alekhina and fellow band member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred to separate regional prisons</a> [JURIST report] generally reserved for dangerous criminals to serve their two-year sentences. Earlier in October Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed on appeal</a> [JURIST report] because she did not actually participate in the protest song, and she vowed to take the band's case to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on charges that the Russian government had illegally detained them and also violated the rock group's right to free speech. All three members were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/FFM/PR_FFM_31012013_en.pdf">adopted the first report</a> [press release, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session19/Pages/IsraeliSettlementsInTheOPT.aspx">International Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</a> [official website] which concluded that a multitude of violations have occurred. Titled "Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan," <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/130/13/PDF/G1213013.pdf?OpenElement">UN resolution 19/17</a> [text, PDF] states that the existence of these settlements, established in 1967, has led to daily, interrelated breaches of human rights characterized by "the denial of the right to self-determination and systemic discrimination against the Palestinian people." In alleging various violations of international humanitarian law, the report relies on the "status and treatment of protected persons" provision under <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600056">Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention</a> [text] in arguing that the "settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State." Specifically, the report claims that the Palestinian settlements have been established for the benefit of only Israeli Jews, and those living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory endure an impeding segregation enforced by military personnel and law enforcement. The impact of the alleged violations supposedly allows the settlements to expand while simultaneously driving Palestinians from their land. The HRC has therefore called on the Israeli government to "ensure full accountability for all violations, put an end to the policy of impunity, and to ensure justice for all victims." The report will be formally presented to the HRC on March 18.

<p>The most recent conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians have raised concern of possible human rights violations committed by Israel. Last month <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/PSIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">pressured Israel</a> [JURIST report] to avoid targeting civilian structures in Gaza, expressing acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilian deaths that month. In August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">called on Israel to investigate</a> [JURIST report] its treatment of Palestinian detainees, alleging that two had been mistreated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpakistan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] on Thursday ordered the chief of the <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], the government's anti-corruption agency, to appear before the tribunal in regard to a letter he wrote that criticizes the court's judges. The letter, written by retired Admiral Fasih Bokhari to Pakistan <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website], apparently accuses the high court judges of attempting to influence the country's upcoming parliamentary elections. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18425141">Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudry</a> [BBC profile] claimed that the letter interferes in court matters and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/01/31/pakistan-top-court-summons-anti-corruption-over-letter-criticizing-its-judges/">summoned Bokhari</a> [AP report] to explain the document on February 4. The anti-corruption chief's spat with the bench stems from his recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-official-refuses-to-arrest-prime-minister.php">refusal to arrest</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18552145">Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf </a> [BBC profile] for corruption charges pursuant to a court order. There, Bokhari argued that there was insufficient evidence to arrest Ashraf for accepting bribes for approving power generation projects during his tenure as Minister for Water and Power. He also noted that additional time was needed for further investigation. In response, the Supreme Court questioned Bokhari's motive behind the argument given that the case was initiated a year ago. Two weeks ago, the court demanded that Bokhari produce the case files to determine whether the evidence is in fact insufficient, but Bokhari claimed that would be impossible due to the short notice. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-supreme-court-orders-arrest-of-prime-minister.php">arrest order for Ashraf was issued</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. 

<p>Pakistan has recently been fraught with conflict and tension between the executive and the judiciary, notably in light of Ashraf's brief term as Prime Minister. Ashraf's predecessor, Yousuf Raza Gilani, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">forced out</a> as prime minister last June after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">convicted him of contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president. In July, only a month after Ashraf became prime minister, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-high-court-orders-new-pm-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">ordered him to reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] against President Asif Ali Zardari within three weeks. Also that month, the <a href="www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-shield-pm-from-contempt-proceedings.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to shield senior officials from contempt of court proceedings, which was widely seen as an attempt to exempt Ashraf from possible claims of contempt for failing to follow the order. When Ashraf did not do as the court requested, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-high-court-postpones-order-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">granted him another two weeks</a> [JURIST report] to comply with its order. In August, after Ashraf still did not reopen the investigation, the court ordered him to appear and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-orders-to-explain-refusal-to-reopen-case-against-president.php">explain his refusal</a> [JURIST report] to comply with the July orders. After his appearance, the Supreme Court then <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-grants-pm-additional-time-to-reopen-presidential-corruption-case.php">granted Ashraf an additional three weeks</a> [JURIST report] to reopen the corruption case. Finally, in mid-September, Ashraf agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pakistan-pm-to-allow-switzerland-to-reopen-corruption-charges-against-president.php">allow the corruption case to be reopened</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The two men were charged with intentional homicide after inciting and coercing eight people to self-immolate, three of whom ultimately died. Lorang Konchok was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and has been stripped of his political rights for life, and his nephew, Lorang Tsering, was sentenced to 10 years and has been stripped of political rights for three years. Almost 100 Tibetans have performed self-immolations since 2009 in order to protest China's policy towards Tibet. Thursday's sentences, which are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/world/asia/chinese-court-issues-severe-sentences-in-tibetan-self-immolations.html">among the harshest ever issued</a> [NYT report] for self-immolation, are part of a concerted effort by China to curb the practice. 

<p>In November both <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website; HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/11/29/china-tibetan-immolations-security-measures-escalate">press release</a>] and the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-china-to-address-human-rights-situation-in-tibet.php">report</a>] attributed the waive of self-immolation's to China's failure to address human rights in Tibet. In February HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/human-rights-organization-demands-china-release-tibet-prisoners.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that China release Tibetan prisoners who were forced into re-education camps. In November 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-concerned-with-china-restrictions-on-Tibet.php">formally expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's treatment of Tibet. In July 2010 HRW published a report that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-used-excessive-force-in-suppressing-tibet-protesters-hrw.php">accused China of violating international law</a> [JURIST report] in its treatment of Tibetan protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Quan was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/vietnam-arrests-vietnamese-american-activist-for-terrorism.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on terrorism charges for planning protests in support of a banned group of US exiles, the <a href="http://www.viettan.org/-English-.html">Viet Tan</a> [advocacy website]. He was released following <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/vietnam-deports-us-activist-held-months-18363174">diplomatic pressure</a> [AP report] from the US. Vietnam and the US have been attempting to strengthen relations over a common concern over China, but Vietnam's human rights record has been a concern for the US. State Department spokesperson <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/bios/180394.htm">Victoria Nuland</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/203538.htm">welcomed</a> [press briefing transcript] Quan's release stating that there is "no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad." Quan has reunited with his family in Los Angeles since being released. 

<p>According to a 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-releases-2012-world-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], the Arab Spring may have inspired Vietnamese citizens to combat their oppressive government. However, Vietnam has reacted harshly and has been cracking down on pro-democracy supporters recently. Earlier this month, Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/vietnam-court-convicts-14-bloggers-of-subversion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 14 bloggers associated with Viet Tan of subversion issued prison sentences ranging from 3 to 13 years. In September a court in Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/vietnam-court-jails-bloggers-for-anti-state-propaganda.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a number of bloggers for anti-state propaganda for defaming the Vietnamese government. In August 2011 an appeals court in Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-appeals-court-upholds-7-year-sentence-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a seven-year sentence for a prominent rights lawyer. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The chief US military judge at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] Colonel James Pohl noted that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/31/us-usa-guantanamo-idUSBRE90U0Z720130131">only he and the court security officer have the authority</a> [Reuters report] to turn on or off the light that would make the courtroom closed to public. A few minutes of Monday's pretrial hearing in the case against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] and four other co-defendants were cut from the closed-circuit broadcast. Pohl held that the censoring was not based on any legitimate reasons because the information withheld was not secret in nature. The order came a day after the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] released an excerpt of the <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/563282/ksm-ii-trans28january2013-pm1.pdf">transcript</a> [text, PDF] from the missing few minutes based on another order issued on Tuesday. The transcript included an objection by the defense lawyer for the proceedings to be closed "because they deal with preservation of evidence of a detention facility." He argued that this was crucial for his client. During the discussions, the red light went on indicating that the courtroom was closed. However, it appeared that neither Pohl nor the security officer were responsible for it. Pohl said that there would be a meeting about who has the authority to turn on or off the light if "some external body is turning the commission off under their own view of what things ought to be, with no reasonable explanation." It was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/politics/transcript-of-guantanamo-hearing-points-to-outside-censors.html">stipulated</a> [NYT report] that the detention facility was referring to secret prisons in Romania and Thailand where the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] held 9/11 defendants. The hearings adjourned on Thursday and will resume on February 11 in which it will be decided whether to halt further hearings until an alleged eavesdropping on defense attorneys' conversations is investigated.

<p>Controversy continues to surround Guantanamo military trials. Earlier this month Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-judge-denies-defense-motions-in-911-uss-cole-trials.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a defense motion requesting a finding that the US constitution was "presumed to apply" in the proceedings and that the prosecution must bear the burden of proving that any particular provision did not apply. Last month a US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-military-judge-upholds-request-to-censor-911-conspirators-testimony.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a request to censor 9/11 conspirators' testimony. In September a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on lawyers representing Guantanamo Bay detainees who have had their <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges denied or dismissed. The Department of Defense announced in 2011 that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/military-prosecutors-bring-charges-against-911-suspects.php">sworn charges against the five men</a> [JURIST report] accused in the 9/11 attacks. In April 2011 US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four others would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military commission</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration abandoned attempts to have the 9/11 suspects tried in civilian courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLUM was joined by various labor unions, including the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/">AFL-CIO</a> [official website]. The suit claims that while the legislation was debated and passed, the public was prohibited from entering the Capitol Building through the public entrance by Michigan state police, affecting a "total denial of public access to the Capitol for over four hours." They assert that this denial of access was impermissible under the Michigan <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(js0tl5njdxycpu45n0zdxjnu))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-267-of-1976">Open Meetings Act</a> [text], the Michigan Constitution and the First Amendment of the US Constitution. They requested that the resulting legislation be invalidated and that the state be enjoined from implementing and enforcing the law.

<p>The right-to-work law has been controversial since its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-lawmakers-approve-freedom-to-work-bill.php">passage</a> [JURIST report] in December, over unanimous Democratic opposition. Earlier this week Michigan <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder">Governor Rick Snyder</a> [official website] sent a letter to the Chief Justice of the <a href="http://courts.michigan.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">requesting an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of the law. In addition to this lawsuit, two other lawsuits have been <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121212/POLITICS02/212120358">filed</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report] challenging the law's passage as a violation of the Open Meetings Act. JURIST guest columnist Susan Bitensky of the Michigan State University College of Law <a href="/forum/2013/01/susan-bitensky-rtw-michigan.php">criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed] Michigan's right to work law as a bill that will "weaken the people and families who depend upon the benefits and protections negotiated by labor unions." Measures to strengthen collective bargaining rights in Michigan have also been controversial. In September the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report], a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure was ultimately <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">defeated</a> [AP report] 57-43 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Federal Circuit <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/01/31/apple-samsung-sales-ban-ruling-idINDEE90U0F020130131">rejected</a> [Reuters report] Apple's request to have the entire court reconsider imposing a ban Samsung's smartphone before trial commences in March 2014. Apple sought a reversal of an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">earlier ruling</a> [JURIST report] by a three-judge panel in favor of Samsung. The Federal Circuit declined to reconsider the case without explanation.

<p>On Wednesday, the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-finds-that-samsungs-infringement-of-apple-patents-was-not-willful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung did not willfully infringe Apple patents. If Samsung was found to have willfully infringed Apple's patents, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion jury verdict</a> [JURIST report] against it could have been increased up to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284">triple that amount</a> [35 USC &#167; 284 text]. The judge's ruling partially abrogates the jury verdict, which had found that Samsung willfully infringed five of Apple's seven asserted patents. Last month Apple agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/apple-withdraws-patent-claim-against-samsung.php">withdraw claims</a> [JURIST report] against a Samsung product that Samsung asserts has never been sold in the US in the second of the two <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">patent infringement cases</a> [case materials] taking place in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW alleges that the Malian government has summarily executed 13 suspected Islamist supporters and forcibly disappeared an additional five. The executions by Malian authorities came after Islamist armed groups reportedly executed seven Malian forces and used children to fight in combat. HRW alleged that despite the fact that Malian authorities arrested and executed Islamist forces in public, the military is denying any knowledge of the killings. HRW urged the Malian government to investigate these killings and forced disappearances and bring the individuals who participated in these abuses to justice. These alleged abuses took place when the Islamist rebels lead an offensive against Konna starting on January 9.

<p>Earlier this week International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-prosecutor-warns-mali-on-human-rights-abuses.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the Malian government over reports of human rights abuses by Malian forces. In the statement, Bensouda urged Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Bensouda announced last week that her office has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed in Mali. Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently regarding political violence and alleged human rights abuses. Last week the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) issued a report saying that the tumultuous situation in Mali has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-mali-turmoil-has-led-to-human-rights-violations.php">led to human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in January the interim president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

"Our budget for 2013 has already been reduced by 12 percent&#8212;some US $17 million&#8212;to cope with the lack of funds," Pillay said on Thursday. "As a result, 46 posts have been cut or frozen, a decision which will affect our ability to respond to ongoing challenges, such as discrimination, climate change, HIV-related issues, protection of human rights defenders and support for various key human rights bodies." In her statement, Pillay also noted this year marks the twentieth anniversary of the OHCHR's work and presented the OHCHR's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/PublicationsResources/Pages/AnnualReportAppeal.aspx">Annual Appeal</a> [UN materials], which describes the Office's budget and planned activities for this year. According to this document, "In recent years, voluntary contributions to [Pillay's] Office have stagnated at around US $110 million. Yet requests for [the Office's] assistance, from governments, civil society and the international community at large, continue to grow."

<p>Recently the OHCHR, among other work, has released a statement on the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-mali-turmoil-has-led-to-human-rights-violations.php">turmoil in Mail</a>, and expressed concern about the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">ongoing violence in Syria</a> and Colombia's <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-human-rights-commissioner-expresses-concern-over-colombia-military-justice-reforms.php">proposed constitutional reform to their military justice system</a> [JURIST reports]. According to the OHCHR's <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/ohchrreport2011/web_version/ohchr_report2011_web/pages/summaries.html">Annual Report for 2011</a> [text, PDF], the OHCHR had 58 field presences: 13 country/stand-alone offices, 15 human rights components of peace missions, 12 regional offices and 18 human rights advisers within United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs). OHCHR's 2012 report will be available in May 2013. <br />

The bill, known as the Human Heartbeat Protection Act, would also require women to undergo a vaginal probe to detect a heartbeat. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] announced its opposition to the bill, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/us-usa-abortion-arkansas-idUSBRE91003K20130201">contending</a> [Reuters report] that women should be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies without interference from politicians. However, the bill's lead sponsor, <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Pages/MemberProfile.aspx?member=Rapert">Senator Jason Rapert</a> [official profile] declared that the Human Heartbeat Protection Act was necessary to protect the unborn:<blockquote>It is found and determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that abortions are currently being performed in Arkansas on unborn children with detectable heartbeats; and that this act is immediately necessary because to protect the lives of unborn children with detectable heartbeats.</blockquote>The bill will now go to the Republican-controlled <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">Arkansas House of Representatives</a> [official website].

<p>Numerous states have changed their abortion laws to restrict the availability of abortion recently, usually leading to legal challenges. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women pregnant beyond 20 weeks. In November Montana voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. Also last month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Georgia's law, bans abortions after 20 weeks. Planned Parenthood also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Violence against women has been a long-standing issue around the world. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">urged India's government</a> [JURIST report] to strengthen critical services for rape victims, expressing sympathy for the family of the 23-year-old medical student who died from injuries sustained in a gang-rape in December.

In November the UN urged countries to implement policies that will <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-urges-international-effort-to-end-violence-against-women.php">end violence against women</a> [JURIST report].

Lead Prosecutor for the Special Investigation Unit Nawaf Abdullah Hamza told BNA that a criminal court in Bahrain determined the policeman fired the shot that killed Ali Abdul al-Mushaima. Al-Mushaima was the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/us-bahrain-policeman-trial-idUSBRE9100BA20130201">first protester to die</a> [Reuters report] in the 2011 unrest. After the death of Al-Mushaima and protester Fadhel Salman Matrook, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">ordered an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the use of force against protesters. The independent commission <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">released its report</a> at the end of November 2011, and one week later the King <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission to convene</a> [JURIST reports] to follow up on the findings of the independent investigation into the violent crackdown on protesters. 

<p>Bahrain has imprisoned numerous activists in the wake of the 2011 protests and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banned all protests</a> [JURIST report] effective October 2012. In January a court in Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-court-releases-shiite-rights-activist-on-bail-pending-trial.php">released</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafda on bail pending trial for charges of spreading false news to harm security. Also in January the highest Bahraini appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-high-court-rejects-appeals-of-13-imprisoned-rights-activists.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 13 prominent pro-democracy protestors convicted by military tribunal in 2011 on charges of plotting to overthrow the monarchy. In December Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php">commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protesters, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment. Earlier in December the prison sentence for outspoken Bahraini rights activist Nabeel Rajab was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-court-cuts-prison-sentence-for-activist-nabeel-rajab.php">reduced by one year</a> [JURIST report]. In November Amnesty International released a brief detailing how Bahrain had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-continuing-rights-abuses-despite-pledge-to-reform-ai.php">failed to meet its obligations</a> [JURIST report] and promises to ensure respect for human rights and prevent further torture within the country. In October the Bahrain appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-upholds-convictions-against-two-teachers-for-organizing-strike-efforts.php">upheld verdicts against two teachers</a> [JURIST report] for organizing a teacher's strike to support anti-government protests. Earlier in October the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] issued to nine medics convicted for their involvement in Bahrain's pro-democracy uprising in February and March of 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text, JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>], enacted in 2010, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-01/religious-nonprofits-won-t-pay-for-birth-control-u-s-says.html">requires employer-provided health care</a> [Bloomberg report] to cover government-recommended preventive services, including birth control pills and sterilization procedures, without co-payments. Since the Act's conception, the Obama administration has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/01/contraception-mandate_n_2598893.html">faced with numerous lawsuits</a> [Huffington Post report] from private companies as well as <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/state-ags-to-continue-with-health-care-contraception-challenge.php">state attorneys general</a> [JURIST report]. According to <a href="http://www.hhs.gov">Health and Human Services</a> (HSS) [official website] <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/index.html">Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official profile], the <a href="http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/factsheets/womens-preven-02012013.html">new regulation</a> [HHS press release] is an effort to provide women with cost-free coverage of recommended preventive care while respecting religious concerns. The rule, jointly-issued by Departments of the Treasury, Labor and HHS, states<blockquote>[T]he rule would amend the criteria for the religious employer exemption to ensure that an otherwise exempt employer plan is not disqualified because the employer's purposes extend beyond the inculcation of religious values or because the employer serves or hires people of different religious faiths. [Also], the rule would establish accommodations for health coverage established or maintained by eligible organizations, or arranged by eligible organizations that are religious institutions of higher education, with religious objections to contraceptive coverage.</blockquote>Under these accommodations, a religious nonprofit would not have to contract, arrange, pay or refer for any contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds. 

<p>In December the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-blocks-contraception-mandate-for-construction-company-over-religious-objections.php">temporarily enjoined</a> [JURIST report] the enforcement of the PPACA's contraception mandate for an Illinois construction company, serving as the first time that a federal court had done so for a company operated by strongly religious owners. This ruling came on the heels of several businesses, including <a href="http://www.hobbylobby.com">Hobby Lobby, Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.mardel.com">Mardel, Inc.</a> [corporate websites], <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/two-businesses-will-not-comply-with-supreme-courts-order-on-contraception-mandate.php">refusing to comply</a> with a US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">order denying an injunction</a> [JURIST reports] against the contraceptive coverage mandate. In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] PPACA, focusing on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text] of the act which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a fee equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Independent experts joined with UN Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression, human rights defense, cultural rights and the right to health to caution legislators in the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] that the proposed law has the potential to subvert fundamental human rights to freedom of expression by specifically targeting and restricting the activity of "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people." Experts portend that the bill's broad scope will lead to judicial constructions that "unduly restrict" and stigmatize the efforts of those advocating for LGBT rights in an already "difficult environment." Special Rapporteur on the right to health, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Health/Pages/SRBio.aspx">Anand Grover</a> [official website], specifically challenged the bill's inclusion of children in asserting that broad constructions may extend to programs promoting sexual and reproductive health among the LGBT community and may prevent children from accessing information that could help to "safeguard" mental and physical health. Lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-lower-house-supports-ban-on-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">approved the first reading</a> [JURIST report] of the bill in January, but it is slated to go before lawmakers for two more readings before a final vote. UN experts urged lawmakers to reject the bill while "the window is still open."

<p>Russian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced the bill</a> [JURIST report] in March. The proposed legislation calls for fines of up to 500,000 rubles (USD $16,500) for promoting the homosexual lifestyle and appears to be aimed at media outlets which lawmakers blame for "promoting gay lifestyles as 'normal behavior.'" Earlier that month, the City Hall of St. Petersburg in Russia announced that the city's governor <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a similar bill that would impose fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The St. Petersburg bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced in November 2011</a> [JURIST report], and sponsors claim it is necessary because homosexual propaganda "threatens" Russia and "sexual deviation" negatively impacts Russian children. Several advocacy groups has challenged the bills as discriminatory. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-to-russia-reject-anti-gay-rights-bill.php">called on authorities to veto the Moscow legislation</a> [JURIST report], which they called a "discriminatory and dangerous initiative." However, Russian legal scholars have asserted that the Russian Constitution may allow limitations to be placed on the rights of homosexuals due to the constitutional ability to balance the interests of society and limit rights of a social group if they infringe upon the rights of another social group.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

Due to diplomatic immunity, all three men had been acquitted in the previous trial where the Milan court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-judge-convicts-23-former-cia.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 23 former CIA agents. Vacating the acquittals, the court now sentenced former CIA station chief Jeff Castelli to seven years, and the two other Americans, Betnie Madero and Ralph Russomando, to six years. The appeals process has been separated for Castelli and the other two men for technical reasons, and the appellate court's reasoning is expected to be released this month. 

<p>Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007.

The WGAD, appointed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], visited Greece for 11 days, finding that the conditions of many of the country's detention facilities fall below international human rights standards. Issues include overcrowding, excessive length of detention, mixing pre-trial and convicted detainees in the same cell and denying detainees the right to free legal assistance. The WGAD did welcome the legislative reforms recently adopted by Greek authorities. Members of the WGAD also commended the Greek authorities for creating the <a href="http://www.minocp.gov.gr/asylo.php?option=ozo_content&perform=view&id=3779&Itemid=465&lang=&lang=EN">Asylum Service Department</a> to establish the <a href="http://www.minocp.gov.gr/asylo.php?option=ozo_content&perform=view&id=3780&Itemid=465&lang=&lang=EN">First Reception Service</a> [official websites], which is to be responsible for screening procedures independent from the police.

<p>Laws and policies governing the treatment of migrants continue to raise international human rights concerns. In August spokespersons for the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) and the UN High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-experts-concerned-about-australia-offshore-detention.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about an Australian law to reopen offshore detention centers used to process migrants and asylum-seekers who arrive in the country by sea. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported in July that migrants residing in Greece face a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-report-migrants-in-greece-face-violence-discrimination.php">rising culture of discrimination and violence</a> [JURIST report]. In June Amnesty International (AI) said the Cyprus government's practice of detaining all illegal migrants seeking asylum in the island nation <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/cyprus-detains-asylum-seekers-in-poor-conditions-ai-report.php">violates international law</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2012 the Israeli Knesset passed a bill that imposes <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-approves-new-law-to-deter-illegal-migrants.php">harsher penalties on illegal migrants</a> [JURIST report] in Israel, as well as on Israelis who help illegal migrants. AI criticized the bill as a violation of human rights. In March 2011 AI released a report documenting discrimination and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-slovenia-to-pretect-roma-migrant-communities.php">human rights violations against Roma migrants</a> [JURIST report] in Slovenia and urging the Slovenian government to protect Roma communities. In September 2010,the Global Migration Group (GMG) adopted a statement urging all governments to respect the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/global-rights-group-urges-states-to-respect-migrant-rights.php">human rights of migrants</a> [JURIST report], who are more likely to face various forms of abuse as they lack proper legal status. The GMG stressed that every person, regardless of migration status, should enjoy the fundamental rights to life, liberty and all fundamental human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The comprehensive report summarizes important human rights issues from around the world in the past year and presents HRW's perspective and recommendations on these issues. Opening with an examination of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, HRW encouraged nations to maintain their commitment to building governments that respect human rights:<blockquote>Building a rights-respecting state may not be as exhilarating as toppling an
abusive regime. It can be painstaking work to construct effective institutions of governance, establish independent courts, create professional police units, and train public officials to uphold human rights and the rule of law. But these tasks are essential if revolution is not to become a byway to repression by another name.</blockquote>HRW encouraged these nations to focus on preventing majority oppression, respecting women's rights and freedom of speech, and providing international support to developing governments. HRW also specifically outlined a need to address human rights violations in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a> [JURIST news archives].

<p>The report considered human rights violations around the world and included 90 country-specific sections. The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/87447?page=1">United States</a> [HRW report] was criticized for its increasing use of the death penalty in criminal justice. The report also criticized the continued maintenance of <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] prison and the indefinite detention of prisoners there. HRW also highlighted as issues life sentences for minors, women's rights and the rights of non-citizens in the US. </p>

<p>The members of the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/european-union">European Union</a> (EU) [HRW report] were criticized for neglecting human rights to focus on the economic crisis. Specifically, HRW said that EU nations must do more to protect irregular migrants and asylum seekers. The report acknowledged that EU member states were working on revisions to policies to protect these groups. The report went on to criticize specific EU nations for violations their treatment of migrants, including France for its recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-france-evicts-romanian-roma-from-camps-country.php">ejection of Roma migrants</a> and Greece for reports of violence and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-report-migrants-in-greece-face-violence-discrimination.php">discrimination against migrants and asylum-seekers</a> [JURIST reports]. The report also expressed concern about racial discrimination and complicity in torture in several EU nations. The report leveled heavy criticism at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/russia">Russia</a> [HRW report] for several human rights violations in the past year. The report pointed to recent legislation including a controversial law <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/russian-president-signs-controversial-protest-legislation.php">increasing fines for illegal protests</a>, a law that labels nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that accept international funding as <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">"foreign agents"</a> [JURIST reports] and a series of provincial laws banning "homosexual propaganda" as signs of declining human rights in the nation.</p>

<p>In Africa, HRW expressed particular concern about the deterioration of human rights in <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/112887">Mali</a> [HRW report]. The rights group said that the ongoing conflict between government forces and Taureg rebels has led to serious human rights violations on both sides of the conflict. In the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/cote-d-ivoire">Ivory Coast</a> [HRW report] HRW said that recent military abuses and ongoing impunity for human rights violators continues to stifle human rights in the nation. HRW also expressed concern about continued violence of the M23 rebellion in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/democratic-republic-congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [HRW report]. HRW acknowledged developmental progress in <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/rwanda">Rwanda</a> [HRW report] but expressed concerns about the freedom of expression and the press. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/112432">Mexico</a> [HRW report] faced criticism for human rights violations committed by law enforcement in an effort to thwart organized crime. The report criticized the country's use of military forces to combat drug trafficking and other instances of organized crime throughout the nation. HRW stated that military abuses during these investigations have not been widely investigated or prosecuted. In South America, HRW expressed particular concern about the ongoing conflict in <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/112451">Colombia</a> [HRW report]. Specifically, the rights group expressed concern about the growing number of displaced citizens of the country and threats against human rights workers and journalists in the country. In <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/112434">Venezuela</a> [HRW report] the group expressed concern about the deteriorating state of human rights under President Hugo Chavez, who was reelected in October. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/112437">Argentina</a> [HRW report] was praised for its prosecution of former government agents involved in abuses during the nations military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s. </p>

<p>Finally HRW considered violations in Asia, focusing much of its criticism on the authoritarian government of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/china">China</a> [HRW report], and its practices of censorship and persecution of human rights defenders. The rights group cited several instances of the arrest or disappearance of human rights activists and journalists promoting change within the country. The group also expressed concern about the governments strict censorship of media and internet access. In <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/north-korea">North Korea</a> [HRW report] the rights group stated that the succession of leader Kim Jong-Un has not affected positive change in the state of human rights in the country. The report acknowledged in <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/india">India</a> [HRW report] government efforts to improve human rights, but emphasized a need to implement protections against rights abuse, particularly with respect to free expression and women's rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/health/Ontario+court+upholds+marijuana+laws+medicinal+case/7905558/story.html">held</a> [<em>Ottawa Citizen</em> report] that although a total ban on the use of medicinal marijuana would be unconstitutional, serious illness does not create an automatic right to use marijuana. The Court of Appeal overruled a trial court decision that struck down parts of Canada's <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-227/index.html">Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</a> (MMAR) and <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA)</a> [texts] as insufficient mechanisms for licensing marijuana. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge erred in his finding that Canada's laws made it nearly impossible for patients to obtain medicinal marijuana: "[O]n a reasonable reading of the evidence, there is no support for the findings that doctors have massively boycotted the MMAR, or that the vast majority of persons seeking to and entitled to receive medical exemptions under the MMAR are unable to obtain those exemptions." The case concerned a man named Matthew Mernagh who was charged under the CDSA with growing his own marijuana after being unable to obtain a medical exemption for the drug.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a hot-button issue in the US and abroad. Last week the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/01/www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-change-marijuana-drug-classification.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that marijuana is still an illegal Schedule I drug under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act</a> [text]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Arizona's medical marijuana law is constitutional and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] for state-regulated marijuana. In the US elections in November, Washington and Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">failed by approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote.

El-Adly, who worked as the head of security for former president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">news archive</a>], was also <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/egypt-ex-interior-minister-gets-jail-sentence-123404818.html">fined 2.3 million Egyptian pounds</a> (USD $342,000) [AP report] by the court. El-Adly was sentenced to life in prison last June for ordering the killing of anti-government protesters during the 2011 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST news archive] that led to the overthrow of Mubarak's regime. It is unclear if el-Adly plans to appeal the court's ruling.

<p>Last February the chief prosecutor in the case against Mubarak and el-Adly asked the presiding judge to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-for-mubarak-in-closing-remarks.php">give the death penalty to both men</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 2011 revolution.

El-Adly was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/egypt-court-convicts-ex-pm-of-corruption.php">convicted on a different corruption charge</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011 due to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141715562214192.html">granting a no-bid contract</a> [Al Jazeera report] to a German businessman to sell license plates in Egypt.

When fighting broke out between government forces and Tuareg rebels in January, the president <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-interim-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] as thousands were forced to flee the fighting. Dieng was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44058&Cr=+mali+&Cr1=#.UQ1cvL80V8E">particularly concerned</a> [UN News Centre report] over allegations of human rights violations committed by the Malian army and reports of mob lynching and looting of properties belonging to Arab and Tuareg communities. Dieng concluded his statement by urging all actors, including the Malian army, to adhere to international humanitarian and human rights laws.

<p>Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently, particularly from the UN as more reports of political violence and human rights abuses come to light. Last week International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-prosecutor-warns-mali-on-human-rights-abuses.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the Malian government over reports of human rights abuses by Malian forces. In the statement, Bensouda urged Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Bensouda announced in January that her office has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed in Mali. Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently regarding political violence and alleged human rights abuses. Earlier that month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) issued a report saying that the tumultuous situation in Mali has led to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-mali-turmoil-has-led-to-human-rights-violations.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21305150">article</a> [BBC report] is part of a larger <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/mariage_personnes_meme_sexe.asp">bill</a> [text, in French] to legalize same-sex marriage in France. The bill is one of the <a href="http://rt.com/news/gay-marriage-france-law-310/">biggest social reforms</a> [RIA Novosti report] proposed in France in decades, and more than 5,000 amendments have been proposed to the legislation.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and correlated rights remain a contentious issue both within the UN and around the world.

HRW called attention to a <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=VsBL0S5b37o%3d&tabid=12254&language=en-US">UN report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-report-details-abuse-torture-of-afghanistan-detainees.php">report</a>] released last month that more than half of pre-trial detainees being held in Afghanistan were being subjected to torture, saying this report "should sound alarm bells for the Afghan government to take decisive action to end torture." Afghan President Hamid Karzai <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/asia/afghan-officials-decry-un-report-on-abuse-in-prisons.html">appointed a commission</a> [NYT report] to look into the findings of the UN report, but he denied that the report accurately portrayed the country's detention centers and the amount of torture that occurs in them. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams, however, said:<blockquote>This government taskforce is little more than window dressing because it lacks the personnel, expertise and political will to credibly tackle the very serious problem of torture in Afghanistan's detention facilities. Afghanistan needs a fully independent and permanent anti-torture body staffed by experienced human rights advocates with the resources and powers to conduct long-term and consistent monitoring and reform.</blockquote>Karzai created the task force on January 22 and gave it two weeks to look into the allegations and respond.

<p>The UN's January report is not the first to be released detailing findings on human rights abuses by the Afghan government. In October the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] which showed that nearly half of the 273 detainees interviewed said that they had been subject to torture. A month earlier, HRW released a report showing that the Afghan Local Police had been committing <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">serious rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and that officers were not being held accountable for these abuses. The UN also released a report in March showing that human rights abuses in Afghanistan were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensifying the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report] in the country, which affected more than two-thirds of its population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Larijana is the leader of the conservative party in the parliament, which has been in a power struggle against Ahmadinejad. Lawmakers sought to impeach Sheikholeslami after he appointed former chief prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi to the head of the Social Security Organization. Mortazavi had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/iran-prosecutor-reportedly-suspended-over-detainee-deaths.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] from his post as chief prosecutor in 2010 after a parliamentary inquiry found that he was responsible for the deaths of three prisoners who were arrested during anti-government protests after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">disputed presidential election</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Despite this move by the parliament against Mortazavi, Iran's government has been criticized for human rights abuses recently, specifically against prisoners and detainees. Last week, the UN urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">stop the execution</a> [JURIST report] of five activists who were sentenced to enmity against God, corruption on earth and propaganda against the government.

The UN in October also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] showing that the Iranian government was torturing human rights activists and threatening their families with rape or death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=174">Zainab Hawa Bangura</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43929&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=#.UQ6YbL-H1QU">criticized the government's response</a> [press release], saying that the "approach taken by the Somali police does not serve the interest of justice; it only serves to criminalize victims and undermine freedom of expression for the press." The <a href="http://unpos.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=9705&language=en-US">UN Political Office for Somalia</a> (UNPOS) [official website] also issued a <a href="http://unpos.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=9705&ctl=Details&mid=12667&ItemID=19579&language=en-US">statement</a> [press release], saying they "will monitor the process throughout and trusts that the defendants will receive a fair trial, in line with the Government of Somalia's stated commitment to ensure due process and the fair administration of justice." Saaid has promised to reform Somali armed forces and the judiciary after the trial, has launched public awareness campaigns to reduce rape, and will soon form a new and independent task force on human rights which will investigate violence against women and journalists.

<p>A collection of human rights groups and free-press advocates <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rights-groups-unite-in-push-to-free-jailed-somali-journalist.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] in January calling for the release of the journalist and three others who were detained in Somalia following the woman's claim of rape by government security forces. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI), <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy websites] joined together to make the public request that Somali forces release journalist Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim and three others who were involved in a report related to rights abuses in the African nation. Ibrahim had interviewed a woman who claimed she had been raped by government forces a few months prior. According to the groups' statement, the Central Investigation Department (CID) of the Somali police arrested the alleged victim, confiscated her phone to call Ibrahim and insisted he turn himself in. CID has since arrested two others who helped put the victim in touch with the reporter though they did release the alleged victim, allowing her husband to take her place in prison. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The judges claimed a crowd of Islamists outside the courthouse of had intimidated the judges and blocked the entrance to the courthouse. The judges stated that they were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/world/middleeast/egypt-morsi-constitution-vote.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0">suspending the court's sessions</a> [NYT report] until they could return to work without the threat of harm and other external pressures. However, the Islamists countered, accusing the judges of fabricating an excuse for failing to show up and claimed that the courthouse's exterior was much quieter than the judges had presented. Hundreds of riot police officers, a fire truck and several armored personnel carriers were available to secure the judges' entry to the courthouse, and several people were able to enter and leave the courthouse without harm. Egypt's <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] had arranged to secure the entrance and protect the judges and stated that the protests were peace and some judges had arrived safely. The constitutional court has been unclear about when it might continue work or issue a decision on the legislative assembly.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the beginning of the revolution. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] in late January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protests throughout the country. Earlier in January, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in cities a day after nationwide unrest compounded following an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death penalties</a> [JURIST reports] for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries. Also in January, an Egyptian rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that police abuse and torture continue to be ongoing issues and that police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court was forced to indefinitely <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">halt operations</a> [JURIST report] in December amid pressure from protesters attempting to block judges from entering the court. Protests in the country have been increasing since Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed the new constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law earlier that month. Many individuals and rights groups have questioned the validity of the constitution, as only 32.9 percent of Egypt's total of 52 million voters actually participated in the referendum to approve it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to their court-appointed lawyer, the group's 65-year-old leader Phan Van Thu was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/vietnam/9846697/Vietnam-sentences-22-activists-to-jail.html">given a life sentence</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] and the other 21 defendants were sentenced to between 10 and 17 years imprisonment with up to five years of house arrest afterward. Thu ran the non-violent group from 2003 until his arrest last February, when the state media reported that Thu had set up two eco-tourism companies as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21318836">fronts for subversive activities</a> [BBC report] such as producing documents critical of the administration. During the weeklong trial each of the 22 men admitted to acting with an aim to overthrow the government. While the proceedings marked the country's largest subversion trial in years, dozens of Vietnamese have been jailed since the government began cracking down on dissidents in 2009 despite widespread international concern.

<p>In releasing its <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-releases-annual-world-report.php">annual World Report</a> [JURIST report] last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] stated that Vietnam's government has been "systematically suppressing freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and persecuting those who question government policies, expose official corruption, or call for democratic alternatives to one-party rule" during the last few years of growing domestic dissatisfaction. Also last week Vietnamese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/vietnam-releases-american-activist.php">released and deported</a> [JURIST report] Vietnamese-American pro-democracy activist Nguyen Quoc Quan after nine months of detention. Quan was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/vietnam-arrests-vietnamese-american-activist-for-terrorism.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on terrorism charges for planning protests in support of a banned group of US exiles. Last month Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/vietnam-court-convicts-14-bloggers-of-subversion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 14 bloggers associated with Viet Tan of subversion issued prison sentences ranging from 3 to 13 years. In September a court in Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/vietnam-court-jails-bloggers-for-anti-state-propaganda.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a number of bloggers for anti-state propaganda for defaming the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of the APA's rule-making requirements is to give <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-50/chapter-13/article-1/50-13-4/">30 days notice</a> [OCGA &#167; 15-13-4 text] to interested persons, the state's General Assembly and the Secretary of State before adopting or repealing any rule. The court's opinion states that the APA specifically excludes the Board of Corrections and penal institutions from qualifying "agencies" under the Act. Therefore, the provisions of the APA do not apply to the Board, unless a section of the Act specifically states otherwise. The court concluded that the Board of Corrections is not required by statute to make rules regarding the subject of lethal injection procedures. The Supreme Court of Georgia held:<blockquote>Due to litigation challenging existing methods of execution and due to other factors, both judicial and non-judicial, that have affected the availability of certain drugs, the Commissioner has recently found it necessary or wise to make repeated changes to the lethal injection procedures employed by the Department. We conclude that it was not unreasonable for the Board to entrust the specific topics involved in the management of executions to the Commissioner under the statutory and constitutional mandates that already apply to him rather than to give him detailed and rigid directives through rules.</blockquote>Thus the court concluded that the Board of Corrections does not have a legal duty under the APA to make rules regarding the lethal injection procedure.

<p>In July the Supreme Court of Georgia unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-supreme-court-halts-warren-hill-execution.php">granted a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] Hill 90 minutes before he was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection. The court granted the stay to consider an appeal by Hill, 52, regarding the recent change by the Georgia Department of Corrections to its lethal injection protocol, the traditional three-drug "cocktail" having been replaced with a single dose of the sedative pentobarbital. In a separate order the court also denied Hill's request to hear his appeal of a Butts County Superior Court ruling, which held that Hill had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-court-declines-to-halt-execution-of-mentally-disabled-death-row-inmate.php">failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</a> [JURIST report] that he is mentally disabled, and that the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard itself is constitutional. <a href="http://www.schr.org/about/who">Terrica Ganzy</a> [official profile], Staff Attorney for the <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website], argued that <a href="/hotline/2012/07/terrica-ganzy-georgia-disabilities.php">Warren Hill was improperly sentenced to death</a> [JURIST comment] and that Georgia should adopt a "preponderance of evidence" standard for mentally disabled claims in capital offense cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mugenzi and Mugiraneza were <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Mugenzi/Case%20Profile/Mugenzi%20and%20mugiraneza%20-%20case%20profile.pdf">arrested</a> [case profile, PDF] in 1999 and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Mugenzi/indictment/index.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] on eight counts of genocide-related crimes for their alleged role in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The prosecution alleged that from 1990 to 1994, Mugenzi, then-acting Minister of Trade, made public statements inciting violence against the Tutsis and approved concealment of mass graves. Mugiraneza, then-acting Minister in charge of civil servants, allegedly issued orders and directives encouraging mass-killings. The ICTR <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Bizimungu/judgement/110930.pdf">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF] both men in 2011 based on participation in a "joint criminal enterprise" that took place at a ceremony where then-President Theodore Sindikubwabo gave an "inflammatory speech inciting [the] killing of Tutsis." On appeal, the judges found that the the trial court had erred in assessing crucial evidence relating to the men's prior knowledge of the speech's content, and thus reversed the convictions and ordered their immediate release. According to media sources, the Rwandan government is likely to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14246766">speak out against the ICTR's decision</a> [BBC report], as both men were influential figures in the government during the 1994 massacre in which more than 800,000 Tutsis died at the hands of extremist Hutus.

<p>The ICTR was established by UN Security Council in 1994 to investigate and prosecute alleged prominent players of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Since then, the ICTR has <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Cases/StatusofCases/tabid/204/Default.aspx">heard more than 70 cases</a> [ICTR case index], and is set to dissolve in 2014 after hearing its final 15 appeals in light of the completion of its trial mandate. In December, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware and sentenced him to 35 years in prison to conclude the tribunal's final trial.

Brigadier General Ali Mamlouk is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/02/20132414472566777.html">accused </a> [Al Jazeera report] of being involved in plotting a series of bomb attacks with former Lebanese information minister Michel Samaha. Samaha, who was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/17/us-usa-lebanon-idUSBRE8BG0R420121217">branded a global terrorist</a> [Reuters report] by the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">US Department of the Treasury</a> [official website], was arrested in August for allegedly plotting to incite violence in Lebanon with the aid of Mamlouk and Syria.

<p>The continuing civil war in Syria has significant influence on the stability of Lebanon, due to the two countries' complex political and sectarian ties. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/08/20128247570570557.html">Violent clashes</a> [Al Jazeera report] between opposing Syrian factions have been commonplace throughout Lebanon since the beginning of the uprising in Syria last year.

The ordinance, which was <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/President-Pranab-Mukherjee-gives-nod-to-tough-anti-rape-ordinance/articleshow/18325707.cms">passed by the Union Cabinet on Friday</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report], will be tabled before the parliament within six weeks of the next session beginning on February 21. The new laws are effective immediately with the president's signature because parliament is not in session but the president deemed immediate action necessary. However, if the bill is not passed, the ordinance will lapse and the laws will no longer be valid. The new law provides for the death penalty in cases of rape that lead to death or a vegetative state, and the minimum sentence has doubled to 20 years for gang rape, rape of a minor, rape by policemen or a person in authority; it can also be extended to life without parole. Women's rights organizations, civil society groups and activists have criticized the ordinance for being inadequate to combat sexual crimes against women and for being passed without proper debate.

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765320">rape</a> and subsequent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20860569">death</a> [BBC reports] of a 23-year-old New Delhi medical student in December 2012 sparked mass protests in India and led to the creation of the committee that recommended the legal reforms in its <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/india-panel-recommends-legal-reforms-in-response-to-rape-incident.php">report</a> [JURIST report]. The report recommended numerous reforms in the way the nation's legal institutions handle rape cases, many of which were taken into consideration in the ordinance. In December Indian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">charged six suspects</a> [JURIST report] with murder after the death of the gang rape victim.

The chief US military judge at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] Colonel James Pohl held that the defense attorney <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/04/guantanamo-judge-defence-cia-eavesdropping">failed to present any evidence</a> [AP report] supporting allegations of eavesdropping. Lawyers for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] accused the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] of secretly listening into their privileged conversations with their client. Pohl stated that the hearings will continue and that he cannot stop the proceedings merely based on suspicion that something might happen. The allegations were raised last week when few minutes of a pretrial hearing in the case against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] and four other co-defendants were cut from the closed-circuit broadcast, for which neither Pohl nor the security officer was responsible. Al-Nashiri is accused of bombing the USS Cole while it was in port in Yemen in October 2000. The prosecution is seeking death penalty for Al-Nashiri.

<p>Last month, Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-judge-denies-defense-motions-in-911-uss-cole-trials.php">denied motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by al-Nashiri's lawyers to dismiss alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> [text, PDF] in August 2012 on grounds that the bombing occurred "prior to the commencement of hostilities" between the US and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Controversy continues to surround Guantanamo military trials. In December, Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-military-judge-upholds-request-to-censor-911-conspirators-testimony.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a request to censor 9/11 conspirators' testimony.

The 16-page memo explores the legal questions surrounding the use of lethal force against a US citizen who is a "senior operational leader of [al Qaeda] or an associated force" outside an area of active hostilities, concluding that the president has the authority to employ lethal measures in response to the imminent threat to the US posed by the operations planning of such an individual. The memo sets forth a three-prong test under which the DOJ would conclude that such force could be legally authorized:<blockquote>[W]here the following three conditions are met, a U.S. operation using lethal force in a foreign country against a U.S. citizen who is a senior operational leader of al-Qa'ida or an associated force would be lawful: (1) an informed, high-level official of the U.S. government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States; (2) capture is infeasible, and the United States continues to monitor whether capture becomes feasible; and (3) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles.</blockquote>The memo goes on to determine that such a lethal operation would be consistent with Fifth Amendment <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] principles, satisfied by the "imminence" and "feasibility" concepts under "applicable law of war principles" as set out in the three-prong test. The memo also specifies that the Fourth Amendment's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/unreasonable_search_and_seizure">unreasonable seizure</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] prohibition is not offended, as are neither certain statutory provisions prohibiting the killing of US nationals abroad, nor the longstanding prohibition against assassinations under Executive Order 12333.

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under scrutiny in recent months. Last month UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism Ben Emmerson announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">begin investigating the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the use of drone strikes. Emmerson said that after asking the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of its use of targeted killings last year, there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct. Also last month Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php">condemned US drone attacks</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. Last month the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. In July Pakistan's Ambassador to the US called upon the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of using drone strikes in targeted killings. That same month US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of drone strikes. <a href="http://www.nnklaw.com/attorney-profiles/samar-warsi">Samar Warsi</a> [corporate profile] of the Muslim Civil Liberties Union recently argued that Obama administration's drone policy <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">sets a dangerous precedent</a> [JURIST comment] and undermines national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-usa-abortion-arkansas-idUSBRE91404E20130205">75-20 vote</a> [Reuters report] the bill will now advance to the state Senate, which last week passed a ban on abortions when a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">fetal heartbeat is detected</a> [JURIST report]. The new House bill provides no exceptions for rape or incest but does allow exceptions if the mother's life is at risk or she faces severe and irreversible injury. Also Monday the House approved a bill that would prohibit insurance companies participating in the health insurance exchange from covering abortion except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother.

<p>Numerous states have changed their abortion laws recently to restrict the availability of abortion, leading to several legal challenges. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation. In November Montana voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. Also that month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Georgia's law, bans abortions after 20 weeks. Planned Parenthood also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The same court in Mogadishu also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/05/somali-woman-jailed-claiming-raped">sentenced</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] freelance reporter Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim, who interviewed the woman in January, to a year in prison on the same charges. Both sentences have been criticized by human rights groups, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/29/somalia-alleged-rape-victim-charged">condemned</a> [HRW report] the charges as "politically motivated" and "a mockery of the new Somali government's priorities." According to HRW, the woman was arrested and interrogated for two days without legal counsel following her complaint before she retracted her story and was released. In response to growing international concern over these charges, Prime Minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/10/2012106143336746746.html">Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid</a> [Aljazeera backgrounder] stated earlier this week that Somalia authorities will do more to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-pm-promises-to-increase-protection-to-rape-victims-journalists.php">protect rape victims</a> [JURIST report] as well as work to reform both the military and judiciary. Both the woman and the reporter are expected to appeal their sentences.

<p>The controversy surrounding this case has been a major concern for the fledgling Somalian government. Last month, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=174">Zainab Hawa Bangura</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43929&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=#.UQ6YbL-H1QU">criticized the government's response</a> [press release], saying the "approach taken by the Somali police does not serve the interest of justice; it only serves to criminalize victims and undermine freedom of expression for the press." A collection of human rights groups and free press advocates last month also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rights-groups-unite-in-push-to-free-jailed-somali-journalist.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the release of Ibrahim and three others who were detained in connection with the woman's claims. The statement, issued by HRW, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy websites], requested that the government release Ibrahim and the others, who were all involved in reporting on the woman's claims and the government's response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

M23 officially withdrew from Goma on December 1 after the Congolese government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/congo-democratic-idUSL5N0B140F20130201">agreed to negotiations</a> [Reuters report], which are currently ongoing in Uganda. In its report, HRW documented 24 cases of summary executions, 21 of which were civilians, by M23 fighters during its occupation of Goma. In addition, HRW reported that M23 fighters raped at least 36 women, including 18 wives and a 10-year-old girl, and recruited armies by force in violation of the laws of war. On the other hand, the report also states that while the Congolese army was retreating from Goma it committed at least 76 cases of rape in neighboring towns. Victims who were raped by Congolese military personnel include women as old as 60 and girls as young as 13 years old. HRW called on the UN to investigate and determine which Congolese army units and officers were responsible for these actions. It also called on the UN, which has already imposed sanctions on M23 leaders, to also impose sanctions on Rwanda officials who have supported them.

<p>The eastern region of the DRC has seen considerable violence and human rights abuses on both sides of the conflict since the M23 rebellion began. In December a UN probe <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-probe-rights-violations-during-recent-violence-in-eastern-drc.php">found</a> [JUIRIST report] that at least 126 people were raped and at least two civilians were killed during violence in the region last November. A month earlier, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned M23</a> [JURIST report] for guerrilla attacks on the DRC and called for an end to all support of the group. HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/drc-rebels-committing-war-crimes-hrw.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] in September alleging that M23 had been responsible for numerous war crimes, including summary executions, rape and forced recruitments. In June a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">leaked UN report</a> [JURIST report] revealed that Rwanda had been helping to create and support M23 and similar rebel groups that have been known to violate human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a report released Tuesday, Darusman noted the accrual of 22 separate reports filed since 2003 documenting various violations of human rights, including torture, arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearances, as well as violations of the rights to food, freedom of expression and movement. The special rapporteur stated that these violations, in conjunction with North Korea's lack of cooperation with the UN and other world organizations, necessitate the establishment of an inquiry mechanism with adequate resources to investigate and more fully document the "grave, systematic and widespread violations of human rights" in the North Korea. 

<p>In November Darusman <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the lack of development in human rights, calling on the nation's new leader Kim Jong-un to remedy the matter.

Nashiri is accused of masterminding the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_4252000/4252400.stm">suicide bombing of the USS Cole</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2000 that left 17 dead and 40 injured. The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/02/04/3216626/guantanamo-war-court-case-stalled.html">CIA used enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] on Nashiri, including water-boarding, and his defense counsel has claimed that he has post traumatic stress disorder as a result. In response, the government <a href="http://www.mc.mil/CASES/MilitaryCommissions.aspx">requested</a> [trial transcripts] the examination under Rule 706 of the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/MCM-2012.pdf">Manual for Courts-Martial</a> [text, PDF]. However, Pohl will hear expert testimony from Dr. Vincent Iacopino of the University of Minnesota Medical School, a leading expert on the proper methods for examining those who have been tortured, before assembling a three doctor panel to assess Nashiri's mental health. 

<p>Monday's ruling came after Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-refuses-to-halt-uss-cole-hearing.php">refused to halt</a> [JURIST report] further hearing in response to unsubstantiated allegations by defense counsel that the government was eavesdropping on private conversations with their client. Last month, Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-judge-denies-defense-motions-in-911-uss-cole-trials.php">denied a motion</a> by Nashiri's lawyers to to dismiss the alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] on the grounds that the bombing occurred "prior to the commencement of hostilities" between the US and al Queda. Pohl, who is also presiding over the trial of alleged 9/11 conspirators, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-military-judge-upholds-request-to-censor-911-conspirators-testimony.php">approved a request</a> [JURIST report] by the government to censor testimony by the defendants with respect to alleged use of enhanced interrogation techniques. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The group includes the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression</a>, the Chair-Rapporteur of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">Working Group on arbitrary detention</a>, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/IRIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on Iran</a> [official websites]. The group called the recent arrests of journalists a "flagrant violation of Iran's obligations under international human rights law." While Iran claims that those detained were <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44070&Cr=Iran&Cr1=#.URFKkuilJjM">collaborating with "anti-revolutionary" entities</a> [UN News Centre report], the UN group is concerned that the crackdown will reinforce self-censorship at a crucial moment for Iran as the 2013 presidential election approaches. 

<p>Iran's record on human rights over the past several years has been under international scrutiny. Last month UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iran not to execute Ahwazi activists. In October the UN Special Rapporteur for Iran accused the Iranian government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report]. That same month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">stop all executions</a> [JURIST report] because the government had failed to comply with fair trial and due process guarantees. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them with fair trials. </p>]]></content:encoded>

S&#38;P assessed the credit risk of structured financial instruments, such as residential mortgage backed securities (RMBSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), and assigned securities with ratings that described the associated risk. The complaint alleges that these ratings were inflated when they were relied upon by investors including many federally insured financial institutions.  Further, the DOJ alleged that "S&#38;P falsely represented that its ratings were objective, independent, and uninfluenced by S&#38;P's relationships with investment banks when, in actuality, S&#38;P's desire for increased revenue and market share led it to favor the interests of these banks over investors." A key claim in the complaint is that the ratings are purchased by the institutions holding the securities under review, creating an alleged conflict of interest.

<p>This is the first civil lawsuit by the DOJ against a credit rating agency following the 2008 housing crisis and resulting economic collapse. However, other federal agencies have filed lawsuits and amended regulations in the wake of the collapse. In January the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Credit Union Administration</a> (NCUA) [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-credit-union-regulator-sues-jpmorgan-over-faulty-mortgage-securities.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against JPMorgan Chase &#38;Co.for the sale of $2.2 billion of faulty RMBSs to credit unions. In June 2011 JPMorgan <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for misleading investors during the housing crises. In December 2008 the SEC approved <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-approves-rule-amendments-for-credit.php">rule amendments</a> [JURIST report] that provided greater oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0126/cbill_2012-20130126_en_1.htm">legislation</a> [HC Bill 126, text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-government-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">introduced late last month</a> [JURIST report], would extend the application of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/contents">Marriage Act of 1949</a> [materials] to same-sex couples as well as opposite-sex couples. The bill also contains exceptions for religious institutions that do not wish to perform same-sex weddings. Same-sex couples in England and Wales have been able to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21194052">enter into civil partnerships since 2005</a> [BBC report], giving them many of the same legal rights as married couples. The vote followed a heated debate, with many of <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron's</a> [official websites] Conservative Party members calling the legislation <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-britain-cameron-idUSBRE91400820130205">morally wrong and not a public priority</a> [Reuters report]. The bill has received strong support from Cameron, as well as the <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/">Labour Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/home.aspx">Liberal Democrats</a> [party websites]. The bill now proceeds to the Public Bill Committee for consideration and debate, then to the House of Lords for final approval.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue worldwide. Last month the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">received briefs</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases defending the constitutionality of laws that define marriage as strictly between one man and one woman. Also last month, the Rhode Island House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. In December JURIST guest columnist Paul Johnson opined that the effect of an ongoing human rights debate in the British Isles and the European Court of Human Rights may have a <a href="/hotline/2012/12/paul-johnson-coe-homosexuality.php">detrimental effect on the same-sex marriage debate</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the UK. The Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit corporation in Nevada which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] in December to grant <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires Nevada to change its definition of marriage from the union of a man and a woman to the union of two persons. In November the office of the Maryland Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">released an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that same-sex couples can obtain marriage licenses, allowing Maryland to become the ninth US state to allow same sex marriage after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> [JURIST reports] enacted similar measures in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Council <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/biography_en.asp">Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland</a> [official profile], speaking at a conference in Ankara, emphasized the importance of reform in the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism, and the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/secretary-general/speeches/-/asset_publisher/gFMvl0SKOUrv/content/high-level-conference-on-freedom-of-expression-and-the-media-in-turkey?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coe.int%2Fen%2Fweb%2Fsecretary-general%2Fspeeches%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_gFMvl0SKOUrv%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D2">pressing need for action</a> [transcript]:<blockquote>Freedom of expression and media freedom&#8212;as guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights&#8212;is a core element of any functioning democracy. ... Legislation has to be brought in line with Council of Europe standards. Some progress has already been achieved. ...  Freedom of expression can disturb the State or any sector of the population, especially when the country is facing threats of terrorism and instability at its borders. But even in these circumstances, freedom of expression is vital. It does not make countries weaker. On the contrary, it strengthens democracy and the rule of law. In fact, any successful struggle against terrorism must be based on democratic principles and rule of law.</blockquote>Jagland also called for complete reform of Turkey's anti-terrorism laws and challenged lawmakers to recognize the Internet's role in exercising freedom of expression. Finally, Jagland expressed continuing support of legislative reform on behalf of the Council.

<p>Turkey continues to face controversy regarding media freedom and anti-terrorism. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website] criticized Turkey in November for <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST report] under the country's vague counterterrorism law. In March 2011 a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Turkish officials to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-urges-turkish-government-to-respect-freedom-of-expression.php">respect journalists' freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2010 a Turkish Magistrate Court in Ankara <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/turkish-court-reinstates-ban-on-youtube.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] the nearly three-year ban on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [media website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] only days after the ban had been lifted. The court ordered access to YouTube blocked after video of former opposition leader Deniz Baykal in a bedroom with a female aide surfaced on the site. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/europe-rights-court-rules-turkey-failed-to-protect-murdered-journalist-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey failed to protect the life of well-known Turkish-Armenian writer and journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>] and failed to adequately investigate his murder and infringed on his right of freedom of expression. Dink, editor of the newspaper <a href="http://www.agos.com.tr/eng/">Agos</a> [media website], was shot and <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/turkish-armenian-author-accused-of.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in Istanbul in January 2007. Prior to his death, Dink was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/turkish-editor-gets-six-month-jail.php">tried</a> and then put on <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/journalist-faces-retrial-for-insulting.php">retrial</a> [JURIST report] for "insulting Turkishness" by writing about the killing of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, after the terrorist attacks on <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001</a> [JURIST backgrounder] the CIA began a secret detention program in which suspected terrorists were held in CIA "black sites" outside of the US where they were subjected to "enhanced interrogation techniques" that included torture and abuse. The CIA also gained the authority, under the Bush administration, to engage in "<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rendition">extraordinary rendition</a>" [JURIST news archive], the transfer without legal process of a detainee to the custody of a foreign government for detention and interrogation. The 54 governments identified cross Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. The report stated that responsibility for the program fell with both the US and the other countries:<blockquote>In the face of this trend, the time has come for the United States and its partner governments to own up to their responsibility for secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations. If they do not seize this opportunity, chances are that the truth will emerge by other means to embarrass them. The taint of torture associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition operations will continue to cling to the United States and its partner governments as long as they fail to air the truth and hold their officials accountable. The impunity currently enjoyed by responsible parties also paves the way for future abuses in counterterrorism operations. There can be no doubt that in today's world, intergovernmental cooperation is necessary for combating terrorism. But such cooperation must be effected in a manner that is consistent with the rule of law. ... Consistent with this principle, it is incumbent on the United States and its partner governments to repudiate secret detention and extraordinary rendition, secure accountability for human rights violations associated with these operations, and ensure that future counterterrorism operations do not violate human rights standards.</blockquote> The report made nine recommendations to the US government, including repudiating the rendition program and the creation of a non-partisan, independent board to investigate the detentions, and six to other participating governments, including refusal to participate in extraordinary rendition or secret detention. 

<p>The issue of CIA extraordinary rendition has been a sensitive one, particularly in Europe. In December the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/europe-rights-court-rules-for-victim-of-cia-extraordinary-rendition.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government of <a href="http://vlada.mk/">Macedonia</a> [official website] is responsible for the torture and degrading maltreatment of a man the ECHR found to be an innocent victim of CIA extraordinary rendition in 2003. In September the Italian <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 23 former CIA officers for the 2003 kidnapping and rendition of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. In April UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a> [official profile] expressed regret over a US court decision denying <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/foia.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [National Security Archive] requests by a member of the UK parliament and the UK <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> [official website], made as part of an <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-counterterrorism-official-criticizes-us-court-decision-on-rendition-information.php">investigation into extrajudicial capture</a> [JURIST report] by the US of foreign terrorism suspects for detention and interrogation. In March in a hearing before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> (EP) [official website], <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] asked EU member states to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/03/amnesty-urges-eu-nations-to-investigate-cia-renditions.php">reconsider their involvement in the extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST report], intending to create the foundation of an EP report that will divulge details of a five-year investigation into each nation's involvement in supporting CIA renditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UNICEF estimates that more than 120 million girls and women have experienced FGM in the 29 countries where the practice is centered. This amounts to 36 percent of females between 15-19 years old who have experienced the practice compared to 53 percent of those between 45-49 years old. While the organizations note this is significant progress, they said there is still need for improvement in efforts to stop the practice. UNICEF notes that opinions of the practice in countries where it is prevalent are slowly changing as well. A more comprehensive report of UNICEF's findings will be published later this year.

<p>As many as 140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of FGM, which is defined by the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website] as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons." Last November, a UN panel <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">urged countries to ban</a> [JURIST reports] female genital mutilation. Last February the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-reports-progress-in-ending-female-genital-mutilation.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] similar progress in ending female genital mutilation. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php">called on the government of Iraqi Kurdistan</a> [JURIST report] to outlaw female genital mutilation and to develop a comprehensive legislative plan to reduce FGM in the region. In 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">Uganda unanimously outlawed FGM</a> [JURIST report] and imposed harsh penalties anyone who conducts the procedure to face imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Calling the sentences a "serious blow to the fight against sexual violence," Pillay called on Somalia to reopen the case against a Somali woman who claimed she had been gang-raped by soldiers and Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim, a freelance reporter who interviewed her about her claim. Pillay further requested the nation launch a "full inquiry to clearly establish what happened." Pillay <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44080&Cr=&Cr1=#.URKtXqVQUX0">stressed</a> [UN News Centre report] that "sexual abuse in the camps for displaced people in Somalia is a real issue, and any effort to expose, denounce and deter these crimes should be supported." Pillay also expressed concern for the chilling effect the sentences could have on journalism in the nation, noting, "It is deeply disturbing that a woman alleging rape can be penalized for reporting such a crime, and a journalist jailed for investigating it."

<p>The controversy surrounding this case has been a major concern for the fledgling Somali government. Last month UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=174">Zainab Hawa Bangura</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43929&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=#.UQ6YbL-H1QU">criticized the government's response</a> [press release], saying the "approach taken by the Somali police does not serve the interest of justice; it only serves to criminalize victims and undermine freedom of expression for the press." A collection of human rights groups and free press advocates also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rights-groups-unite-in-push-to-free-jailed-somali-journalist.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the release of Ibrahim and three others who were detained in connection with the woman's claims. The statement, issued by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy websites], requested that the government release Ibrahim and the others, who were all involved in reporting on the woman's claims and the government's response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling overturns a <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/australia-court-rules-google-violated-consumer-protection-laws.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/142">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> (ACCC) [official website] brought the case against Google challenging an advertising practice where advertisements were generated that indicated that by clicking on the link the user would be led to information about a competitor, but actually linked to the advertiser's website. On appeal, the High Court ruled that although the advertising practice was indeed misleading and deceptive, the representations were not made by Google, but rather by the advertisers. Google did not create the advertisements and was merely acting as a passive conduit for the advertisers. The High Court additionally stated that ordinary and reasonable users would not assume that Google had endorsed the representations made in the sponsored links. The ACCC <a href="http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/1100729/fromItemId/142">stated</a> [press release] that it will "will carefully review the judgment of the High Court to understand whether it has broader ramifications and will consider any consequences for enforcement of the Australian Consumer Law."

<p>Google has already faced sharp opposition to its new policies around the world. In October European regulators urged Google to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/eu-authorities-urge-google-to-clarify-privacy-policy.php">clarify</a> [JURIST report] its privacy policy. In August Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/google-to-pay-ftc-million-fine-for-misrepresenting-privacy-protections.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay a record fine of $22.5 million to the  <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] after being charged with tracking users' search histories and targeting ads to those users in violation of a previous privacy settlement. In March EU's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/justice/index_en.htm">Justice Commissioner Vice-President Viviane Reding</a> [official website] declared that Google's new policy <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eu-official-google-privacy-changes-are-in-breach-of-eu-law.php">violated EU privacy laws</a> [JURIST report], and EU data authorities voiced concern about the sharing and combination of personal data across services and its compliance with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm">European data protection legislation</a> [text]. Google has also faced criticism for its policy in the US where the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] in late February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] filed by consumer privacy group <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] asking the FTC to block Google's then proposed changes. In addition, the <a href="http://www.naag.org/">National Association of Attorneys General</a> (NAAG) [official website] last February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/state-attorneys-general-concerned-about-google-privacy-policy.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Google signed by 36 state attorneys general expressing concerns about the company's new privacy policy. In January 2012 Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">issued a letter</a> in response to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">concerns raised by members of Congress</a> [JURIST reports] regarding consumer privacy rights as impacted by the new policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, Virginia <a href="https://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?131+ful+SB719ES1">Senate Bill No. 719</a> and <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+HB1337H2">House Bill No. 1337</a> [texts] remove "several items from the list of acceptable identification documents that a voter must present when voting at the polls on election day." Removed items include a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, or paycheck that shows the name and address of the voter, as well as a voter's social security card. The laws also require that all forms of voter ID contain a photograph of the voter in addition to the voter's name and address. The latter requirement is similar to <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?131+sum+SB1256">Senate Bill 1256</a> [text], which was also passed on Tuesday and "[eliminates] all forms of identification that do not contain a photograph of the voter from the list of forms of identification...a voter must present in order to be allowed to vote." Because the congressional vote was split considerably along party lines, <a href="www.ltgov.virginia.gov">Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling</a> (R) [official website] was called to cast the tie-breaking vote, which he did in favor of the new voting regulations. If passed and signed by <a href="www.governor.virginia.gov">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> (R) [official website], all new voting measures would take effect in 2014.

<p>Virginia's new laws mark the second time in two years that the Commonwealth has altered voting regulations. In August McDonnell <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/doj-department-approves-virginia-voter-id-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had approved Virginia's voter ID law involving voting procedures, finding that the law did not violate the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> [text]. Prior to the law, the Commonwealth required identification at the polls, but allowed voters to cast ballots without it if they signed an affidavit swearing their identity. That law eliminated the affidavit option while adding several other acceptable forms of identification, all of which have been removed by Tuesday's new legislation. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">more than 30 US States</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 17 states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. The issue remains legally controversial, most notably in <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-supreme-court-expedites-challenge-to-state-voter-id-law.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/wisconsin-ag-to-ask-state-supreme-court-to-reinstate-voter-id-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-supreme-court-allows-voter-id-question-on-november-ballot.php">Minnesota</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Belaid was killed by gunfire outside of his home on Wednesday morning. Pillay described Belaid as "a prominent defender of human rights and democratic values, and a firm opponent of political violence, which just yesterday he publicly condemned as 'a blow against the democratic process in the country.'" Pillay also called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation regarding the killing and called for additional protection to other political leaders who have received similar threats of violence. Protests have flared around Tunis, and <a href="http://moncef-marzouki.net/">President Moncef Marzouki</a> [official website, in Arabic] has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21359260">announced</a> [BBC report] an intention to create a new non-partisan government in the wake of the assassination.

US District Judge Sidney Stein said the government of Iraq could not recover damages under a US anti-racketeering law because "the scheme described by Iraq is primarily foreign, focused on a multinational organization, engineered by a foreign government, and concerned with Iraqi oil, goods, and contracts." In addition, the court held that "the Republic of Iraq bears responsibility in this action for the Hussein Regime's corruption of the [Program]," rejecting Iraq's attempt to "sidestep responsibility because the conduct was illegal or the actors held power illegitimately." Iraq brought the claim in 2008, accusing more than 90 companies, subsidiaries and affiliates of responsibility for the program's corruption.

<p>The oil-for-food program was established in 1996 by the UN, allowing Iraq to sell oil in order to finance the purchase of food, medicine and other goods for those citizens hurt by <a href="/thisday/2010/08/un-imposed-sanctions-on-iraq.php">international trade sanctions</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of the first Gulf War. Since its inception, several companies and individuals involved with the program have been accused of corruption. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.ge.com/">General Electric Co.</a> (GE) [corporate website] agreed to a $23.5 million settlement after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint accusing GE of <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ge-agrees-to-settle-sec-complaint-in-oil-for-food-scandal.php">bribing Iraqi officials</a> [JURIST report] to receive contracts under the oil-for-food program. That April a Paris judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/france-oil-company-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] French oil company <a href="http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html">Total</a> [corporate website] with bribery and complicity in connection with the program. According to the 2005 Volcker report, published by a UN-appointed <a href="http://iic-offp.org/index.html">Independent Inquiry Committee</a> [official website] investigating corruption in the oil-for-food program, oil companies like Total allegedly paid Iraqi officials <a href="http://iic-offp.org/story27oct05.htm">over $1.5 billion in illegal kickbacks</a> [materials] in exchange for being selected as oil purchasers. Additionally, oil company <a href="http://www.chevron.com/">Chevron</a> [corporate website] also <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/chevron-settles-sec-charges-in-oil-for.php">paid a large settlement</a> to the SEC concerning misuse of the program, and two Texan oil barons, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/texas-oil-company-owner-sentenced-to.php">David Chalmers </a>and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/texas-oil-tycoon-sentenced-to-year-in.php">Oscar Wyatt Jr.</a> [JURIST reports], were sentenced to prison for their roles in the scandal. In 2005, Grundfos, a Danish company that produces industrial pumps, <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/danish-supplier-admits-role-in-un-oil.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that two employees paid kickbacks to authorities in Saddam Hussein's government under the oil-for-food program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law would allow authorities to detain certain suspects indefinitely if they are found to have aided al Qaeda, the Taliban or "associated forces." Section 1021(b)(2) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF] affirms the authority of the president under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to detain indefinitely any "person who was a part of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces." Opponents of the law <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-usa-security-lawsuitbre9151an-20130206,0,6148919.story">argue</a> [Reuters report] it would potentially stifle journalists' freedom of speech, an argument supported by the lower court. Lawyers for the government claim that striking down the law would pose a threat to national security and are quick to point out that no journalists have been held under the law in the 10 years since it was passed.

<p>Controversy surrounding this provision has escalated since it was originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-enjoins-indefinite-detention-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] last September. In December Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/justice-ginsburg-denies-request-to-block-indefinite-detention-law.php">denied</a> a request to block the law after challengers of the law <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/indefinite-detention-law-appealed-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court to block its enforcement. The district court's order striking down the law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/second-circuit-grants-emergency-stay-to-continue-enforcement-of-indefinite-detention-law.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] by the Second Circuit just after the district's ruling in September. The Second Circuit then <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-extends-stay-on-order-blocking-indefinite-detention-law.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] the stay until it could officially rule on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ex-spy chief, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profile], has been indicted by the ICC for crimes against humanity stemming from the alleged murders and persecution of Libyan protesters during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and uprising in 2011. Despite the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/icc-orders-libya-hand-intelligence-chief-18428241">order</a> [AP report], however, Libyan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/libya-denies-request-to-hand-over-gaddafis-son-to-icc--dnp.php">continue to contend</a> [JURIST report] that the ICC is a court of last resort and that the transfer of al-Senussi is unnecessary given that Libya is prepared to try him in a domestic proceeding. Al-Senussi's lawyers contend, however, that the former intelligence chief will not receive fair treatment in any Libyan tribunal, thus making an international trial obligatory. If Libya refuses the order and extradition of al-Senussi, the ICC may then report the matter to the <a href="www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] for further investigation.

<p>Thursday's news is the latest in the ongoing effort by Libya to try Gaddafi's son, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile], and al-Senussi nationally rather than turn them over to the ICC. Last month, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-asks-libya-to-explain-plans-to-try-gaddafi-son.php">asked Libya to address reports</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to try Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi. In October, Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to allow the men to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. In August, Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly. In June, four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained by Libyan security forces</a> [JURIST report] and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released. The ICC <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/06/20116278148166670.html">issued arrest warrants</a> [Al Jazeera report] for both men in June 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Maria Alekhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Natalia Tolokonnikova were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.

<p>Last month court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-feminist-rock-group-appeal-of-internet-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the band's appeal of an Internet ban on their videos. The court ruled that the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government was "extremist" and President Vladimir Putin argued that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population.

In Part II of its overall report, the <a href="http://turkel-committee.com/index-eng.html">Turkel Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.turkel-committee.gov.il/files/newDoc3/Summary.pdf">made 18 recommendations</a> [press release, PDF] to various branches of the Israeli government for improving its response to future incidents like the raid. Among its most imperative recommendations, the commission stressed the need to "establish a unit specializing in the laws of armed conflict ... at the Ministry of Justice." Additionally, given that a criminal investigation was not opened immediately after the Gaza flotilla raid, the group urged "the adoption of a policy that requires investigations into significant and unusual incidents" despite there being no legal obligation to do so. Finally, the commission recommended that the scene of such incidents be investigated by a fact-finding assessment team assigned to focus on the legal aspects of the incident. The work of the commission, which is headed by former <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Israeli Supreme Court</a> [official website] Justice Jacob Turkel and began over two years ago, is now complete.

<p>The Turkel Commission <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/commission-concludes-israel-did-not-violate-international-law-in-flotilla-raid.php">released the first part of its report</a> [JURIST report] in January 2011, finding that Israel was in full compliance with international law regarding both security maritime regulations and humanitarian obligations during the Gaza flotilla raid, which resulted in the deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-human-rights-council-adopts-report-on-israel-flotilla-raid.php">adopt a report</a> that <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-report-finds-israel-flotilla-raid-violated-international-law.php">criticized Israel's raid</a> [JURIST reports] of the Gaza-bound flotilla and finding that the country committed various violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. One month prior, Israeli <a href="http://www.netanyahu.org/biography.html">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/israel-complied-with-international-law-in-flotilla-raid-pm.php">testified before the civilian commission</a> [JURIST report] and expressed confidence that the commission would find Israeli actions to be in compliance with international law, explaining the Israeli response to the flotilla in the context of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. In July 2010 an Israeli military probe into the flotilla incident found insufficient intelligence and planning, but <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">concluded that no punishments were necessary</a> [JURIST report]. The incident took place on May 31, 2010 when Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza. International law scholars have disagreed about the propriety of the IDF's raid, with some claiming that there were <a href="/forum/2010/10/israel-raid-on-gaza-flotilla-us-failure-to-condemn-despite-un-findings.php">clear violations of international law</a> while others found the raid <a href="/forum/2011/01/proportionality-and-the-flotilla-incident-in-light-of-international-law.php">necessary and proportionate</a> [JURIST op-eds]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The defense claimed that the prosecution's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenyan-war-crimes-suspect-asks-international-court-to-reconsider-trial-decision/2013/02/06/dfdc7c2a-7075-11e2-b3f3-b263d708ca37_story.html">evidence is fraudulent</a> [AP report], especially given that one of the key witnesses who testified against Kenyatta abandoned his position. Counsel for Kenyatta requested that the court reassess whether the prosecution in fact has sufficient evidence for the prosecution. The prosecution did not comment on the recently filed motion. Kenyatta has been charged for crimes against humanity arising out of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">2007 post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive] in which more than 1,000 people died. His <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sets-april-trial-date-for-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">trial has been set</a> [JURIST report] to begin on April 11 along with former civil service chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case material].

<p>The two Kenyans had <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in December that, despite their upcoming trials, they will be running together in the next presidential election, scheduled to take place next month. Concern surrounding the trial has been growing as the trial and election draw closer. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [case material], who also faces charges for crimes arising out of the 2007 post-election violence, is considered a leading candidate in the election which will take place March 4. In May the appeals chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/icc-rejects-jurisdiction-challenge-in-kenya-cases.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the jurisdiction challenges in the cases, clearing the way for trial. The defense lawyers had argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over them. The appeal stemmed from the pre-trial chamber's decision to confirm the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icc-confirms-charges-against-4-suspects-for-kenya-violence.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] against the four men in January. The ICC claimed jurisdiction over the case despite Kenya's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">calls for dismissal</a> [JURIST report]. The Kenyan government argued that it was capable of prosecuting the accused men domestically.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ICTB has been controversial since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established</a> [JURIST report] by Bangladeshi officials in 2010 to investigate and prosecute crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War.

HB 658 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/alabama-governor-signs-revised-immigration-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by Alabama <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] last May and was designed to "simplify and clarify" the state's existing <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 56, PDF]. In a press release, the ACLU criticized the immigrant "black list" which offers no mechanism for persons on the list to challenge their inclusion. Justin Cox, staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project said the provision is unconstitutional and called on Alabama to consider alternatives:<blockquote>This law violates privacy laws and basic constitutional rights, as well as conflicts with fundamental American values of fairness and equality. Instead of moving forward with a mean-spirited law that is doomed to fail, Alabama should join the rest of the country and focus on common-sense reforms that benefit citizens and immigrants alike.</blockquote>The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.almd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama</a> [official website], asks the court to issue a permanent injunction blocking the provision of the law that mandates the immigrant black list. 

<p>Alabama is currently litigating a challenge to another portion of its immigration regulations. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange last month <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/alabama-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asked the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to overturn a recent decision striking down provisions of Alabama's HB 56. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-appeals-court-denies-alabama-request-to-reconsider-immigration-ruling.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by the state of Alabama to reconsider its ruling in November. Alabama's appeal is from a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] issued last August by the Eleventh Circuit which struck down several provisions of HB 56, including a provision that requires public schools to check the immigration status of students and makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to solicit work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The instrument, called the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/docs/A.RES.63.117_en.pdf">Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [text, PDF], was developed in 2008 by the international body to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29277&Cr=Pillay&Cr1=#.URP1KR1lW8A">provide a voice</a> [UN News Centre backgrounder] to victims of rights abuses but had no effect until the Protocol was adopted by 10 participating nation-states. On Tuesday, Uruguay became the tenth member to ratify the Protocol which activated the provision that the instrument would go into full effect three months from that date, May 5. Calling the event a "major breakthrough," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12968&LangID=E">welcomed the development</a> [press release] saying the activation of the Protocol would: <blockquote>"[P]rovide an important platform to expose abuses linked to poverty, discrimination and neglect, which up until now victims have had to endure without any possible recourse at the international level. It will provide a way for individuals, who may otherwise be isolated and powerless, to make the international community aware of their situation."</blockquote>Pillay has requested that the other 160 nations in the UN also ratify the Protocol.

<p>The Protocol only has effect on the nations which have individually ratified it meaning that when the Provision takes effect only Argentina, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and Uruguay will be subject to its provisions. Some critics have suggested the opt-in nature for the Protocol means that many suspect nations will not be governed by the instrument, leaving those people most in danger of rights abuses with no change in their means to report those abuses. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Javier Zuniga of AI has argued that Duvalier's particular alleged crimes, which include torture, executions, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances are not subject to statute of limitations under international and stated that "the whole credibility of the Haitian justice system" is at stake in Duvalier's prosecution.

The judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/07/us-microsoft-google-ruling-idUSBRE91614U20130207">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that certain parts of three different Motorola patents were not valid. Motorola has sought $4 billion for alleged violations of its wireless and video patents by Microsoft. Microsoft maintains that Motorola is only entitled to approximately $1 million per year. Google acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion, but Microsoft contends that Motorola should only receive a small portion of the royalties for its product. Both Microsoft and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] have been engaged in lawsuits against Google and its partner companies, such as <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> [corporate website].

Senegal's national assembly adopted a law in December allowing for the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/senegal-adopts-law-creating-special-tribunal-for-former-chad-dictator.php">creation of the special tribunal</a> [JURIST report] with the support of the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-08/african-court-opens-in-senegal-to-try-ex-chadian-ruler-habre-1-.html">financial assistance from the European Union and the US</a> [Bloomberg report]. The Extraordinary African Chambers will operate within the existing Senegalese court structure in Dakar and will have sections to handle investigations, trials and appeals. Habre is accused of administering thousands of political killings during his eight-year rule from 1982 to 1990. Seven victims <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/french/themes/habre-plainte.html">filed a criminal complaint</a> [complaint, in French] against him in January 2000, and a Senegalese court indicted him. However, the case was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/french/themes/habre-inculpation.html">dismissed on appeal</a> [ruling, in French] for a lack of jurisdiction. Habre's trial in the new tribunal will not begin until the prosecution completes its investigation, which will begin next week and is expected to last 15 months.

<p>Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in a bloody coup in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre, who has been been under house arrest there since 2005. In March lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium. In July 2011 Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision to deport Habre</a> [JURIST report] back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned of possible torture. That month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay Habre's deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death in absentia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/tr/politika/131022--teror-yasa-tasarisi-yasalasti">passing this legislation</a> [ANA report], Turkey may have narrowly avoided expulsion from the <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/">Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF) [official webpage]. Turkish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6595511.stm">President Abduallah Gul</a> [BBC profile] now has 15 days to approve the legislation, after which it can be enacted. FATF has given Turkey <a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/FATF%20Public%20Statement%2019%20October%202012.pdf">until February 22</a> [FATF public statement] to remedy deficiencies in its terrorist financing offense and establish an adequate legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets consistent with the FATF Recommendations. Expulsion from the FATF would have put Turkey in the company of countries like Iran and North Korea, restricted foreign activity with Turkish banks and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/07/us-turkey-financing-law-idUSBRE91614K20130207">negatively affected its credit ratings</a> [Reuters report]. 

<p>Turkey's anti-terrorism legislation has been shrouded in controversy for some time. The <a href="http://www.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/council-of-europe-urges-turkey-to-speed-up-legislation-reform.php">urged Turkey</a> [JURIST report] to move more quickly in its efforts to reform legislation. Council <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/biography_en.asp">Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland</a> [official profile], speaking at a conference in Ankara, emphasized the importance of reform in the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism. In January a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/turkish-court-charges-nine-lawyers-under-anti-terrorism-law.php">Turkish Court charged nine lawyers</a> [JURIST report] for membership in an outlawed group under Turkey's anti-terrorism laws. The lawyers, including some human rights advocates, are accused of being associated with the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (RPLP), a group that advocates for a Marxist state and has claimed responsibility for violence and assassinations in the country since the 1970s. Most recently, the group <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/world/europe/marxist-group-claims-attack-on-us-embassy-in-turkey.html?_r=0">claimed responsibility</a> [NYT report] for a suicide bombing attack on the US Embassy in Ankara. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website] criticized Turkey in November for <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST report] under the country's vague counter-terrorism law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://courts.arkansas.gov/supremecourt/">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-states-execution-law.php">struck down the 2009 version of the law</a> [JURIST report] last year, finding that a provision allowing the state department of corrections to choose the drug for lethal injection violates the separation of powers in the <a href="http://constitutions.vlex.com/source/arkansas-constitution-1318">Arkansas constitution</a> [text]. Since the Supreme Court ruling, lawmakers have tried to craft more specific death penalty legislation. The proposal approved by the Senate on Friday would require death sentences be carried out with a lethal dose of a barbiturate. <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Mike Beebe</a> [official website] told reporters that <a href="http://thecabin.net/news/state/2013-02-07/senate-approves-changes-ark-death-penalty-law#.URVQJ2e4q7s">he would sign the law</a> [AP report] if it was passed despite his personal objection to the death penalty.

<p>The shortage of sodium thiopental, a drug used in the lethal injection process, in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol. In August, a state judge in Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arkansas-judge-rules-part-of-execution-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law provision allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections violates the constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. In March of last year, two Texas inmates <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [USA Today report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/us/02lethal.html">Kentucky and Tennessee surrendered supplies of sodium thiopental</a> [NYT report] to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) after the agency seized Georgia's supply in order to investigate whether the drug was properly imported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44094&Cr=displace&Cr1=#.URVcw2e4q7s">praised</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> [official website] on Friday. If the bill is signed into law, the Philippines will become the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to have legislation embracing the <a href="http://www.idpguidingprinciples.org/">UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</a> [text, PDF] according to the UN. The bill outlines specific protections for displaced persons and offers compensation for IDPs who lose homes and property. The UN High Commission for Refugees has estimated that approximately 300,000 people were displaced throughout the Mindanao region between January and October of last year alone due to natural disaster and rebellion, prompting the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-legislature-ratifies-bill-granting-compensation-for-rights-abuses.php">passage</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/billtext_15/hbt5990.pdf">Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013</a> [text, PDF]. The refugee bill must still be signed by <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/biography/">President Benigno Aquino</a> [official profile] in order to become law.  

<p>The plight of the internally displaced harkens back to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Hurricane Katrina as well as the more recent Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster. Following the Hurricane Katrina fallout in 2005 the US Human Rights Network <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/rights-groups-condemn-failure-to.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] that the rights of the hundreds of thousands of hurricane evacuees&#8212;in legal terms, not refugees forced out of their own country by persecution, but rather IDPs forced from their homes inside a country&#8212;be fully respected according to the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. In 2004 the UN special envoy for tsunami recovery following the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/un-envoy-urges-more-human-rights.php">commended</a> [JURIST report] the efforts made by the affected countries for providing the basic rights under the UN Guiding Principles, but nonetheless urged leadership to do more to protect human rights.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ's <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/">Antitrust Division</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/publishers-reach-settlement-in-e-book-antitrust-claim.php">reached</a> agreements <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/doj-reaches-settlement-with-publisher-in-price-fixing-lawsuit.php">previously</a> [JURIST reports] with <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/">Hachette Book Group Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C.</a>, <a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/">Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/">Simon &#38; Schuster Inc.</a> [corporate websites], making Macmillan is the last of five publishers to reach a settlement. As a result of the agreement, Macmillan will lower its prices on e-books. Though Macmillan CEO John Sargent maintained his assertion that the company had done nothing wrong, he explained in an <a href="http://www.tor.com/John%20Sargent#filter">online letter</a> [tor.com blog] addressed to "Authors, Illustrators and Agents" that Macmillan chose to settle "because the potential penalties became too high to risk even the possibility of an unfavorable outcome." The proposed settlement was filed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] and will await approval by a federal judge after a 60-day comment period. The DOJ stated that it will continue to litigate against <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple, Inc.</a> [corporate website] for conspiring with the five publishing companies, with the trial scheduled to begin in June.

<p>The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some commentators have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is merely <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">"superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books as loss leaders in order to drive the sale of Kindles. Other commentators, however, state that commentators against the settlement agreement and the defendants' arguments are based on a premise that <a href="/forum/2012/04/harry-gerla-ebook-pricing.php">competition is wrong</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amateur film sparked violent protests in the Middle East last year for portraying the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud and a womanizer. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/09/net-us-egypt-youtube-idUSBRE91804Q20130209">declared</a> [Reuters report] that YouTube should be blocked because by choosing to carry <em>Innocence of Muslims</em>, YouTube provided a forum for insulting the Prophet Muhammad and disrespecting the beliefs of Muslims. The NTRA plans to carry out the ruling as soon as it receives a copy of the verdict. The ban is expected to last one month.

<p><em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has generated a great deal of political, religious and legal controversy. Two weeks ago an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">upheld the death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of seven Coptic Christians and an American preacher on charges stemming from the film. In September an actress who claims she was duped into appearing in the film <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/actress-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-anti-islam-film-film-from-youtube.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] requesting that the film be removed from YouTube.

Kiai stated that protests and rallies must be peaceful to be protected by international human rights law and urged the Middle East states to prosecute those responsible for the violence. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-violence-over-anti-islam-film.php">urged religious and political leaders</a> [JURIST report] to encourage an end to the violence that followed the release of the film.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee will determine whether to grant amnesty to Myanmar's political prisoners, many of whom were allegedly falsely charged or convicted of a serious offense, arbitrarily detained, or imprisoned solely for their peaceful political activities. There has been a strong international political push to encourage Myanmar to establish such a committee. However, Isabelle Arradon, AI's Deputy-Director for the Asia-Pacific, expects more from the committee:
<blockquote>"We are heartened by this very important first step towards establishing a review mechanism. However, it is imperative to have assurances that the mandate of this new committee will extend to all prisoners who have been unfairly detained, not only political prisoners....The commission should have a strong mandate in order to bring an end to arbitrary detentions and ensure human rights for prisoners and detainees in Myanmar."</blockquote>
AI further calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience, and for a fair retrial for persons found to have suffered an unfair trial.

<p>Forming a committee to review political prisoner cases is the latest in a series of reform efforts under Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Sein</a> [BBC profile]. In January, Sein <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/myanmar-ends-ban-on-public-gatherings-after-25-years.php">abolished Order No. 2/88</a> [JURIST report], which banned gathering and delivering speeches in public by a group of five or more people. Earlier that month, Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/myanmar-repeals-junta-law-for-sentencing-dissidents.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] a 1996 law enacted under which dissidents could be sentenced for up to 20 years for delivering speeches that threatened peace and stability. In December Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20856701">announced</a> [BBC report] that it would permit privately owned newspapers for the first time in 50 years beginning in April. In conjunction with a visit by US President <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archive] in November Myanmar announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-the-government-of-myanmar.php">releasing a number of political prisoners</a> [JURIST report]. In September Myanmar announced <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/myanmar-announces-amnesty-for-514-prisoners.php">amnesty for 514 prisoners</a> [JURIST report], identified by activists to include several political detainees and foreigners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay urged South Africa to take a stronger approach to prevent the ongoing sexual violence incidents against tens of thousands of South African women every year. On February 2, Booysen was raped and mutilated in Bredasdorp, and although she survived the attack, she died the following day from her injuries. Pillay acknowledged the strong reactions from <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=7">President Jacob Zuma</a> [official profile], other political actors, NGOs and trade unions, but expressed dismay at low rates of arrest and conviction for the crime of rape in the country. Pillay noted that South Africa has the highest rates of rape reported to the police anywhere in the world, and encouraged the government to take steps to both to strengthen legal responses to crimes of rape and to address the "root causes" of sexual violence in the country.  She <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44101&Cr=rape&Cr1=#.URfFVb-H1QU">stressed that sexual violence is a concern</a> [UN News Centre report] not only for women, but also for men, and urged men to actively participate in stopping gender-based violence and discrimination in South Africa. 

<p>Pillay has recently been addressing issues of sexual violence throughout the world. Earlier this month, Pillay  <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">urged the government of Somalia</a> to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12969&LangID=E">reopen the case</a> [press release] of a reporter and an alleged rape-victim who were both <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-court-sentences-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to a year in prison, and called the sentences a "serious blow to the fight against sexual violence." Pillay stressed that "sexual abuse in the camps for displaced people in Somalia is a real issue, and any effort to expose, denounce and deter these crimes should be supported" and expressed concern for the chilling effect the sentences could have on journalism in the nation. In January, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-praises-india-report-on-violence-against-women.php">praised</a> JURIST report] a <a href="/paperchase/121798698-Justice-Verma-Committee-report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], issued in response to the rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old New Delhi medical student in December, "a groundbreaking basis for action against violence against women in India." The report advocated for reform of Indian life, including political, judicial and cultural changes and changing the manner in which police and the judiciary respond to rape accusations and punishments. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW stated that the Kurdistan Security Agency and Kurdistan police had arrested journalists and publishers of articles without warrants and had detained them for up to a year without filing charges or holding trials. HRW also criticized a proposed criminal insult law that, if passed, would limit free speech and prevent investigative journalism by banning "insult" against religious and political leaders. The rights group stated the government should respect <a href="http://krp.org/docs/PressLaw-KRI.pdf">Article 2 of the Kurdistan Press Law</a> [text, PDF], which protects journalists' right to obtain and publish information without fear of arrest, and provides that a journalist may not be charged with defamation if the journalist publishes or writes about the work of a public official so long as what was published does not go beyond the affairs of the profession. HRW called on the KRG to end impunity for government officials who abuse their power in ordering the arrests of journalists and political activists. 

<p>The KRG has previously been criticized for its violation of free speech and free press.

		<title>HRW to Afghanistan: prosecute sexual abusers, not victims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthrw.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/09/afghanistan-don-t-prosecute-sexually-assaulted-children">said</a> [press release] on Sunday that Afghanistan needs to take steps to ensure that its laws protect victims of sexual abuse and do not result in their prosecution. HRW is calling for this reform following a recent court decision which convicted a 13-year-old boy and sentenced him to one year in juvenile detention on moral crimes charges for having sex with two adult men in a park. Afghan law, which outlaws sexual relations between a man and a boy, punishes both parties to the sexual relations. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams said,  <blockquote>When a man has sex with a 13-year-old child, the child is a victim of rape. The Afghan government should never have victimized this boy a second time, but instead should have released him with urgent protection and assistance.</blockquote>The adult men were also arrested and charged with moral crimes, but their cases are still pending. An Afghan prosecutor said the boy was charged and convicted because he told authorities he had consented to sexual relations with the men. Afghanistan does not have an age of consent, so the men's actions did not constitute sexual abuse under its law. The boy's sentence is currently under appeal.

<p>Rights groups have showed increasing interest in the treatment of victims of sexual abuse in several countries. Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called on South Africa to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urged-comprehensive-approach-to-sexual-violence-in-south-africa.php">increase its efforts </a> [JURIST report] to prevent sexual violence following the rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl. Also last week, the UN called on Somalia to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">re-open a recent case</a> [JURIST report] in which an alleged rape victim and a journalist were both convicted of insulting a government body and making false claims for reporting on the woman's claims that she was raped by Somali soldiers. The UN also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-praises-india-report-on-violence-against-women.php">praised a recent report</a> [JURIST report] released by the Indian government recommending improvement in police and judicial response to rape accusations and harsher penalties for those convicted of sexual assault.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This amendment would allow either side to appeal against a conviction for reasons including inadequate sentencing and will allow prosecutors to appeal an order of acquittal. As of now, prosecutors can only appeal against an order of acquittal. The proposal is a response to six days of protests that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, the leader of the Islamist <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [official website] party, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for convictions including murder, rape and torture. Many protesters believed that this penalty was too lenient, and that Mollah's sentence was too light and that he should have been sentenced to death for his crimes.  Ahmed <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/10/us-bangladesh-protest-verdict-idUSBRE91905K20130210">proclaimed</a> [Reuters report] that the amendment "will be passed in the current parliament session." </p>

<p>Mollah's sentence was the latest to be handed down for war crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> (BLW) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Last week, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-death-sentence-imposed-in-bangladesh.php">expressed concern</a> over a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-member-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST reports] that was handed down last month against Abul Kalam Azad, another former leader of JI, for similar war crimes. Both Azad and Mollah's sentences were handed down by Bangladesh's second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTB">news archive</a>], which was established in March 2010 specifically to hear cases involving war crimes during the BLW.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UNAMA interviewed 635 conflict-related detainees in detention facilities across Afghanistan, finding that more than half of those interviewed had experienced maltreatment and torture. Afghan commission head Abdul Qadir Adalatkhwa stated that 148 of 284 prisoners interviewed by the commission in the provinces of Kabul, Kandahar and Herat <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/afghan-government-prisoner-abuse-systematic-18462197">complained of torture and mistreatment</a> [AP report]. The panel confirmed 136 of those cases. Adalatkhwa also noted that over 66 percent of interviewed prisoners had no access to defense lawyers, but the commission has made no conclusions or recommendations. Additionally, Adalatkhwa denied that torture and maltreatment of any individual prisoner is ongoing, claiming that such abuses only occur only at the time of arrest and during initial interrogation. The panel also interviewed 23 female detainees and confirmed no allegations of rape or sexual abuse.

<p>Last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Afghanistan to make meaningful reforms to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-to-afghanistan-end-torture-in-government-detention-facilities.php">end the use of torture in government detention centers</a> [JURIST report], with HRW citing last month's UNAMA report and condemning Karzai's commission of inquiry. UNAMA released the first <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">report on detainee torture in Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] in October 2011, detailing findings similar to those in the report released last month. In December UNAMA released another report detailing the implementation of the <a href="http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/EVAW%20law%20-%202009.pdf">Law of Elimination of Violence against Women</a> (EVAW law) [text, PDF] enacted in August 2009, finding that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">women in Afghanistan still face abuse</a> [JURIST report] at the hands of men despite progress in the implementation of a law to protect women's rights. In November HRW urged the Afghan government to institute a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/afghanistan-government-ends-death-penalty-moratorium-with-8-executions.php">moratorium on further executions</a> [JURIST report] after eight men were hanged, marking an end of Afghanistan's four-year virtual moratorium on the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court granted an injunction enjoining the defendants' business, <a href="http://www.compassionateapothecary.com/">Compassionate Apothecary</a> (CA) [website], from selling medical marijuana because such sales constitute a public nuisance. The CA is a privately owned medical marijuana dispensary that facilitates patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana using a locker system for patients to store and trade excess marijuana. The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/michigan-court-rules-marijuana-cannot-be-sold-at-private-dispensaries.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28oj4zel45bz2ozbfn4ponvfim%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Initiated-Law-1-of-2008">Michigan Medical Marihuana Act</a> (MMMA) [text] does not allow qualifying patients under the Act to distribute marijuana to other qualifying patients, but it diverged from the lower court in holding that the definition of "medical use" under the act does include the sale of marijuana. The court's majority reasoned:<blockquote>Under MCL 600.3801, any building used for the unlawful manufacture, transporting, sale, keeping for sale, bartering, or furnishing of any controlled substance as defined in MCL 333.7104 is declared a nuisance. Marijuana is a controlled substance under MCL 333.7104. Because the medical use of marijuana is allowed under state law to the extent that it is carried out in accordance with the MMMA, the MMMA controlled whether defendants' business constituted a public nuisance. While the Court of Appeals erred by excluding sales from the definition of "medical use," it correctly concluded that the MMMA does not contemplate patient-to-patient sales of marijuana for medical use and that by facilitating such sales, defendants' business constituted a public nuisance.</blockquote>Although sales is included under the definition of "medical use" the patient-to-patient sale of medical marijuana constitutes a public nuisance according to the Act. There was one dissenting justice. 

<p>Marijuana was a hot-button issue in several states in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">November election</a> [JURIST report], with Washington and Colorado legalizing the drug. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] introduced an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In December the US Department of Justice warned Washington state that although voters in the state <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">legalized marijuana in November</a> [Initiative 502, PDF], marijuana is still <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/doj-warns-washington-state-that-marijuana-remains-illegal-under-federal-law.php">illegal under federal law</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ILO estimates that 21 million people are subject to forced labor, which often includes human trafficking for labor exploitation. The report stressed the need for more stringent action to prevent abuses, identify victims and prosecute perpetrators. It also noted that countries in Latin America and Asia have enacted policies and action plans to address and criminalize forced labor, but the report concluded that such measures have been unsuccessful in acting as a deterrent and that many problems still exist. According to the ILO, punishment is often a small fine or very short prison sentence, many countries do not sufficiently inspect labor conditions, and identifying victims remains a challenge. In an upcoming meeting at ILO headquarters this week, the need for <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_204399/lang--en/index.htm">further measures will be discussed</a> [press release], focusing particularly on prevention, victim protection and trafficking for labor exploitation. The meeting will also reexamine the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C029">Forced Labor Convention</a> and the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C105">Abolition of Forced Labor Convention</a> [texts], which are aimed at guaranteeing freedom from forced labor for all human beings. 

<p>In recent years, forced labor has been a growing subject of international attention, with particular reference to human trafficking. Last month the ILO released a report highlighting the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-report-shows-domestic-workers-lack-adequate-legal-protections.php">vulnerability of domestic workers</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. In June the ILO released a report estimating that forced labor workers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/nearly-21-million-work-in-forced-labor-report.php">nearly doubled</a> [JURIST report] worldwide from its 2005 estimate of 12 million. In November 2011 the UN criticized North Korea for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">abusing political prisoners in forced labor camps</a> [JURIST report]. In August of the same year, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">urged Thailand to combat forced labor</a> [JURIST report], especially with regard to human trafficking. During the same month, the BBC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the government of Zimbabwe is running illegal mining camps using forced labor. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A referendum on Scottish independence is <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/433745/20130211/scottish-independence-alex-salmond-eu-membership-legality.htm">scheduled</a> [IBT report] for fall 2014. The possibility of secession has raised concern over the relationship between an independent Scotland and preexisting UK membership in a number of international organizations, particularly the EU. As noted in the report "there is no clear precedent for a metropolitan part of an EU Member State becoming independent and then either claiming automatic membership or seeking in its own right to join the EU." The report indicates that most likely Scotland would be required to join the EU as a new member state, and therefore be subject to the application procedure and requirements. The report mirrors <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20664907">remarks made</a> [BBC report] by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/index_en.htm">President Jose Manuel Barroso</a> [official profile] in a BBC interview in December, where he stated that any independent state would have to apply for EU membership according to the established rules. 

<p>The recent push for a referendum regarding Scotland's independence has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/scotland-does-not-have-legal-right-to-hold-independence-referendum-report.php">marked a turning point</a> [JURIST report] in the decades-long negotiations between Scotland and the UK. In October British <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> and Scottish <a href="http://www.snp.org/people/alex-salmond">First Minister Alex Salmond</a> [official websites] formally agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-leaders-move-forward-with-scottish-independence-referemdum.php">hold a referendum</a> [JURIST report] regarding the independence of Scotland, potentially ending the union between the two nations in place since the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aosp/1707/7/contents">Union with England Act of 1707</a> [text]. The current draft of the referendum differs considerably in terms and direction from the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/scotland-government-unveils-draft.php">original</a> [JURIST report], presented in February 2010, although both draw their authority from <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/30">Section 30 of the Scotland Act</a> [text]. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/scottish-independence-poll-shows-more-voters-undecided-over-u-k-.html">Current polls</a> [Bloomberg report] show 48 percent of Scottish voters opposed to independence with 28 percent in support of it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In an official statement released by the UN after a recent visit, Baderin <a href="http://www.polity.org.za/article/unamid-statement-by-professor-mashood-adebayo-baderin-un-independent-expert-on-the-situation-of-human-rights-in-the-sudan-at-the-end-of-his-second-mission-to-the-sudan-10022013-2013-02-11">asserted</a> [statement] that many detainees are suffering from health problems without access to medical treatment. He urged the government to release or promptly charge the detainees with "recognizable offenses and bring them before a court of law." Baderin also asserted that the NISS has "clamped down" on civil society organizations by preventing complaint submissions to the National Commission on Human Rights in Khartoum. The report elaborates:<blockquote>The [National Commission on Human Rights] has rightly protested this hindrance on its function. I have expressed my regret about the occurrence of these incidents and urged the government to desist from such actions. I again call on the government to allow civil society organisations to operate freely, to respect the right to freedom of assembly, the freedom of expression, press freedom and also create an enabling environment of free and open political discourse in the on-going constitutional making process... I urge and encourage the Government to strengthen its effort to improve the situation of human rights in the country and endeavour to address [these] challenges...</blockquote>Baderin <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-sudan-must-improve-human-rights.php">visited the country in June</a> [JURIST report] and, while acknowledging steps taken by the government, he called for improvement in the areas of human rights, freedoms of expression and freedom of press. His final report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in September.

<p>Sudan has a history of human rights issues, and the UN and other human rights groups have continuously called on the country to make improvements. In January <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end its crackdown against political and cultural groups. In October the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] called on Sudanese authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">investigate an attack on one of its convoys</a> [JURIST report]. In August the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">called on Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to investigate violent and excessive force by the government against protesters. In July <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] and HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-urge-sudan-government-to-end-abuse-of-protesters.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end violence and abuse against protesters. In June the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-calls-on-sudan-government-to-improve-humanitarian-conditions.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about deteriorating conditions in Sudan due to continued violent conflict in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the benefits now extended to same-sex partners include access to commissaries, family counseling, child care, disability and death compensation, payments to missing persons and legal assistance. Benefits such as housing and burials were not included because they "present complex legal and policy changes," but they will continue to be considered for the future. The benefits listed in the memorandum will be accessible to same-sex spouses and to partners who have signed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership, an accommodation for couples residing in states that do not allow same-sex marriage. This change is the most recent response to the 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/feature/featured/dadt/">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a> [JURIST news archive], which prohibited openly gay individuals from serving in the armed forces. Panetta plans for these benefits to become available by the end of August, though he has given military services until October 1 to put these changes into effect.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST feature] and correlated rights remain a contentious issue both within the US and around the world. Earlier this month, France's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/france-national-assembly-approves-article-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an article that would redefine marriage as between two people, rather than one man and one woman. Also this month, JURIST guest columnist California Senator <a href="http://sd28.senate.ca.gov/">Ted Lieu</a> [official website] <a href="/hotline/2013/02/ted-lieu-ca-reparative-therapy.php">discussed in detail</a> [JURIST comment] a California law passed last year that bans reparative therapy, or "sexual orientation change efforts." In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-to-russia-reject-anti-gay-rights-bill.php">reject a proposed law</a> [JURIST report] that would fine individuals or organizations, including government officials, who promote homosexuality to minors. The bill had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-lower-house-supports-ban-on-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">approved by the lower house</a> [JURIST report] days earlier. Also in January, the <a href="http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/">Virginia Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-protect-state-lgbt-employees-from-discrimination.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit the state government from discriminating against its employees based on sexual orientation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/bills/hb2800p.pdf">law</a> [HB 2800, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] last May but has has been on temporary hold since October following a lawsuit by Planned Parenthood. US District Court Judge Neil Wake, who <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST report] Arizona from implementing the public funding law in October, ruled the law would violate the <a href="http://law.justia.com/cfr/title42/42-3.0.1.1.2.2.10.3.html">freedom of choice provision of the Medicaid Act</a> [text], which provides Medicaid beneficiaries the right to obtain services from any qualified Medicaid provider, and granted Planned Parenthood's motion for summary judgment. The case is expected to be appealed by the state.

<p>Numerous states have recently increased restrictions on abortions, leading to several legal challenges. Last week the <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">Arkansas House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-house-approves-ban-on-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved a ban on abortions</a> [JURIST report] after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill will now advance to the state Senate, which recently approved a ban on abortions when a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">fetal heartbeat is detected</a> [JURIST report]. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation. In November Montana voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. Also that month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Georgia's law, bans abortions after 20 weeks. Planned Parenthood also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECHR ordered the Italian government to pay the couple &#8364;17,500 (USD $21,900) in damages and court fees. 

<p>Law 40 has not only been challenged for its ban on screening embryos, but also for its ban on using embryos for scientific research, which has been a controversial issue internationally. Last month the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-denies-challenge-to-funding-of-embryonic-stem-cell-research.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in a case challenging federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. In December a court in Florence <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-strikes-down-ban-on-embryonic-research.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Law 40's ban on research using embryos, saying that it unconstitutionally violates fundamental health and freedom of research rights. That case will next move up to be considered by the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/default.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website]. In 2008 Brazil's high court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/brazil-high-court-upholds-stem-cell.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] allowing embryos to be used in stem cell research, rejecting a claim that the law infringed on the constitutional right to life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Three independent UN human rights experts on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12981&LangID=E">called for the immediate release</a> [press release] of two key opposition leaders and their family members in Iran. Former presidential candidates Mehdi Karoubi and Mir Hossein Mossavi have been confined to their homes since February 2011 after staging a rally in solidarity with protesters in Egypt, for which they had sought permission from the authorities. Additionally, Mossavi's two daughters Zahra and Nargis were reportedly <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44117&Cr=iran&Cr1=#.URpYSOgapFU">detained earlier this week</a> [UN News Centre report] after speaking out against their parents' house arrest. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran <a href="http://www.shaheedoniran.org/english/">Ahmed Shaheed</a> [official website] urged "the Iranian government to immediately and unconditionally release the two opposition leaders and their family members, and to end all restrictions on their movement and legally protected activities." Noting that Iran is a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], Shaheed charged Iran as being "obliged to protect the civil liberties of all its citizens, including the rights to be protected against arbitrary detention (Article 9), to be informed of any charges against them, to be given access to legal counsel, and to face an independent and impartial tribunal." El Hadji Malick Sow, Chair-Rapporteur of the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website], noted that none of the individuals in question have been charged or permitted to contest their detention before a judge, calling the situation a "violation of Iran's international obligations and national laws, which provide that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention." In August the Working Group adopted an opinion on the case, finding the detention to be arbitrary. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/SRFreedomAssemblyAssociationIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association</a> [official website] Maina Kiai stated that the obligation of Iranian authorities to protect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression are particularly relevant in the context of Iran's upcoming presidential elections in June. "It is of the utmost importance that members of civil society, including the media and human rights defenders, as well as political activists, be given greater space to avail themselves of these rights," Kiai added as he and the other Special Rapporteurs also urged Iran to release hundreds of other prisoner of conscience who remain imprisoned for peaceful exercise of those rights.

<p>Special rapporteurs hold unpaid honorary positions apart from UN staff, and are appointed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to examine and report back on a country situation or a specific human rights theme. Iran in particular has come under increased scrutiny in recent years over its record on human rights. Last week Ahmed Shaheed and El Hadji Malick Sow joined the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders</a> [official websites] to collectively <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-to-release-detained-journalists.php">urge Iran to end its recent crackdown on journalists</a> [JURIST report] and release those who have been already been detained. The group called the recent arrests of journalists a "flagrant violation of Iran's obligations under international human rights law." Last month UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iran not to execute Ahwazi activists. In October the UN Special Rapporteur for Iran accused the Iranian government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report]. That same month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">stop all executions</a> [JURIST report] because the government had failed to comply with fair trial and due process guarantees. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them with fair trials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=91979">new law</a> [text] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/indian-president-signs-sexual-assault-ordinance-despite-objections-from-womens-groups.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/">President Pranab Mukherjee</a> [official website] in early February. The rights groups contend that the new law fails to meet current international human rights standards, noting it does not "criminalize the full range of sexual violence with appropriate punishments in accordance with international human rights law." According to HRW, the law fails to draw distinctions between different levels of sexual misconduct and assault. The press release also criticized the ordinance claiming certain provisions effectively grant immunity to members of police and military forces accused of sexual violence. South Asia director at HRW, Meenakshi Ganguly, condemned the new provisions, stating that "India's laws should not give the police and armed forces special privileges to commit sexual violence and other human rights abuses." The groups also criticized other facets of the law, including the increased age of consent and new definitions of "trafficking," which HRW believes would unfairly harm legal sex workers.

<p>Reform of the criminal legal code in regard to sexual violence has been a serious issue in India since the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20860569">gang-rape and death</a> [BBC report] of a women in New Delhi in December. The incident sparked mass protests in India and led to the creation of the committee that recommended legal reforms in a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/india-panel-recommends-legal-reforms-in-response-to-rape-incident.php">report released in January</a> [JURIST report]. The report recommended numerous reforms in the way the nation's legal institutions handle rape cases, many of which were taken into consideration in the ordinance. In December Indian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">charged six suspects</a> [JURIST report] with murder after the death of the gang rape victim. Also in December Indian <a href="http://pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-prime-minister-calls-for-peace-after-rape-protests.php">called for peace</a> [JURIST report] after a protest over sexual violence resulted in a clash between protesters and police.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment <a href="http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/12/three-minutes-of-silence">permits</a> [bdnews24 report] appeals against "inadequate sentence" in war crimes cases. According to Cabinet Secretary Musharraf Hossain, <a href="http://www.asianewsnet.net/Bangladesh-approves-amendments-to-intl-crimes-trib-42599.html">there is currently no provision</a> [ANN report] for plaintiffs or the government to appeal against any sentence handed down by the tribunals, other than an acquittal.  

<p>The amendment was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">in response to six days of protests</a> [JURIST report] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, the leader of the Islamist <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website] party, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for convictions including murder, rape and torture&#8212;a decision which the demonstrates assert is too lenient.

The bill was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/france-gay-marriage-vote/">approved</a> [CNN report] by a vote of 329 in favor to 229 against, with 10 abstaining, and must ultimately be approved by the senate in order to become law. The senate, which is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21433198">dominated by Socialists</a> [BBC report], is expected to approve the measure. Despite being backed by French Socialist <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15311645">profile</a>], the bill has been controversial, and last month <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/01/14/169305336/thousands-in-france-protest-gay-marriage">350,000 demonstrators</a> [NPR report, transcript] took to the streets to protest its passage. If the bill becomes law, France will become the twelfth country to approve same-sex marriage. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial globally in recent years. Earlier this month, the UK Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill. Last month, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">received briefs</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases defending the constitutionality of laws that define marriage as strictly between one man and one woman. Also last month, the Rhode Island House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill</a> that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state.

The lawsuit seeks to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-02-11/michigan-bar-to-forced-union-dues-challenged-in-lawsuit">block enforcement</a> [Bloomberg report] of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nmnl2p45ngbfwkin1hcfxa55))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectname=2011-SB-0116">private sector</a> [SB 0116 materials] portion of the anti-union legislation, claiming that it violates federal labor statutes as well as the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a> [materials]. The private sector law and its <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nmnl2p45ngbfwkin1hcfxa55))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectname=2011-HB-4003">public sector</a> [HB 4003 materials] counterpart were <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-enacts-freedom-to-work-bill.php">passed in a lame duck session</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/">Michigan Legislature</a> in December despite unanimous Democratic opposition, and the laws were quickly signed into law by Republican <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder">Governor Rick Snyder</a> [official websites], making Michigan the twenty-fourth state to enact "right-to-work" legislation.

<p>The Michigan legislation has been controversial since its passage. Last month the <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan</a> (ALCUM) [advocacy website] and various labor organizations collectively filed a similar lawsuit in state court against both the private and public sector laws, claiming that while the legislation was debated and passed, the public was prohibited from entering the Capitol Building through the public entrance by Michigan state police, affecting a "total denial of public access to the Capitol for over four hours" in contravention of the Michigan <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(js0tl5njdxycpu45n0zdxjnu))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-267-of-1976">Open Meetings Act</a> [text], the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28qt2y2345awbxplrdsiyrwc45%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> [materials] and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1toc_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. Also last month Snyder <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">requested an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://courts.michigan.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] on the constitutionality of the laws. Earlier in January <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=8">Susan Bitensky</a> [academic profile] of the Michigan State University College of Law <a href="/forum/2013/01/susan-bitensky-rtw-michigan.php">criticized Michigan's right to work law</a> [JURIST op-ed] as a bill that will "weaken the people and families who depend upon the benefits and protections negotiated by labor unions." In September the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report], a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure was ultimately <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">defeated</a> [AP report] by a 57-43 margin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/yemen0213webwcover_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], entitled "Unpunished Massacre: Yemen's Failed Response to the 'Friday of Dignity' Killings," details the shortcomings of the probe and concludes that an investigation conducted by the Yemen government under former president <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=\&quot;Ali+Abdullah+Saleh\&quot;">news archive</a>] was "fraught with political interference and ignored evidence implicating government officials." Many officials who purportedly played a role in the massacre where at least 200 additional protesters were injured have not been charged or prosecuted. HRW called on the transition government to reopen the criminal investigation of the implicated perpetrators and ensure that the probe is credible, impartial and meets international standards.

<p>Yemen has received criticism from the international community and human rights groups for its flawed investigations of deaths that occurred during the nations yearlong pro-democracy protests. In June 2011 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] to send a panel to investigate the human rights situation in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/YEIndex.aspx">Yemen</a> [OHCHR backgrounder]. Amid fervent protests in April 2011, Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down from power</a> [JURIST report], ending his 32-year reign as the nation's leader, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Earlier that month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">urging the international community</a> [JURIST report] to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate the deaths of protesters. The protests in Yemen have been analyzed in two recent JURIST op-eds: <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt</a> by <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L Ali Khan</a>, Professor of Law at Washburn University, and <a href="/hotline/2011/03/the-middle-east-protest-movements-each-with-a-story-all-with-uncertainty.php">The Middle East protest movements: each with a story, all with uncertainty</a> by <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11787855&amp;Itemid=326/">Dr. Jonathan Schanzer</a>, Vice President of Research, <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php">Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The conflict and subsequent deaths arose out of a revolt against <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder], which began with peaceful protests that quickly turned into violence between Assad's forces and demonstrators. Pillay also urged the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] in an effort to quell the escalating violence. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon</a> [official website] also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44121&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.URu0YoYe-8A">urged the Security Council</a> [press release] to take action in an <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6595">address</a> [text] to a US think tank on Monday:<blockquote>Syria is self-destructing. ... Our responsibility is to get to the roots and make the violence stop. But for the moment, division rules the day&#8212;inside Syria, in the region, in the UN Security Council. The Syrians are not ready to talk to one another. The regime remains as repressive as ever. The situation cries out for action by the Security Council in particular. ... The Security Council must no longer stand on the sidelines, dead-locked, silently witnessing the slaughter. It must be willing, at long last, to come together and establish the parameters for the democratic transition that could save Syria.</blockquote>Despite call from the international community, the Security Council is <a href="http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=303039">not likely to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC</a> [Reuters report], which is not an official UN body.

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the opposition since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Last month more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC. A study carried out by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported in January that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">average number of deaths per month has increased significantly</a> [JURIST report] since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012. A UN official said in November that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Pillay called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report]. Her statement came after <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported earlier that month that the Syrian government was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">using cluster bombs</a> [JURIST report] against opposition forces. In September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">UN investigators reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number and frequency of human rights violations committed by both sides of the conflict were increasing rapidly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW stated that the airstrikes killed at least 43 Palestinian civilians, including 12 children. The laws of war provide that only military objectives, those which make an effective contribution to military action, may be targeted. HRW field investigations found 14 strike sites lacked indication of containing a legitimate military target at the time of the attack. In four strikes, although the attacks may have targeted Palestinian fighters, they appeared to cause disproportionate civilian harm. HRW stated the attack resulting in the most civilian deaths was the November 18 bombing of a family home which killed 12 civilians, and the HRW claims that even if the home contained a valid military target that the attack caused disproportionate loss of civilian life and property. Several missiles and a bomb struck civilians and civilian homes and other property without apparent military objective. The HRW said "[w]hatever the weapon used and the conduct of the other side, the laws of war are applicable and parties to the conflict are obliged to respect them."

<p>The <a href="/forum/2012/12/laurie-blank-israel-hamas.php">recent conflict in Gaza</a> [JURIST op-ed] has raised concern of possible human rights violations committed by Israel. HRW last Friday <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.idf.il/english/">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] of war crimes after a November aerial bombing raid killed 12 civilians in Gaza. Earlier last week UN Special Rapporteur Richard Flak <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">pressured</a> [JURIST report] Israel to avoid strikes on civilian structures in Gaza. Pillay expressed acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilians killed and injured as a result of Israeli military action and suggested that allegations of war crimes would depend on the circumstances of each particular attack. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report claims that the government has not followed through on the mandates the government's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lessons+Learnt+and+Reconciliation+Commission">Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission</a> (LLRC) [JURIST news archive] established for itself to thoroughly investigate claims of civilians killed by pro-government forces during the conflict. According to the report, though the LLRC was limited:<blockquote>[It] nonetheless made significant and far-reaching recommendations for reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law. This was widely heralded by prominent community figures, religious leaders and civil society in Sri Lanka eager to join hands in a genuinely consultative and inclusive reconciliation process. ... Unfortunately, however, the Government has made commitments to only some of the Commission's recommendations, and has not adequately engaged civil society to support this process. The steps taken by the Government to investigate allegations of serious violations of human rights further have also been inconclusive, and lack the independence and impartiality required to inspire confidence.</blockquote><a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] <A href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-srilanka-unbre91c0vp-20130213,0,4532300.story">disputed the report</a> [Reuters report] saying that his government has proceeded with carrying out the LLRC's recommendations and that it has continued to quickly respond to new claims of human rights abuses.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. Last July <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to stop <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. In May Rajapaksa <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/sri-lanka-ex-army-chief-fonseka-freed-from-prison.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] former Sri Lankan army chief <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8356676.stm">Sarath Fonseka</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fonseka">news archive</a>]. In November 2011 the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In April 2011 a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last year the Republican-led <a href="http://house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] and the Democratic-controlled Senate both passed renewal bills, but they were <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/senate-renews-violence-women-act-article-1.1262231">unable to reach a compromise</a> [AP report] over a provision concerning whether tribal courts could prosecute non-Indians accused of assaulting Indian women on reservations. The bill's passage was welcomed by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/statement-president-senate-passage-violence-against-women-act">President Barack Obama</a>, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/statement-vice-president-biden-violence-against-women-act">Vice President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/February/13-ag-188.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [press releases]. The issue will now go before the House, where Republicans are creating their own version of the bill, although the Indian court provision is still expected to generate friction.

<p>In 2011 a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.26.Add.5_AEV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/rapporteur/docs/RashidaManjoo.doc">Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile, DOC] said that there is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">continued prevalence of violence</a> [JURIST report] and discriminatory treatment of women in the US, with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. The report said the US has taken some positive steps with the passage of the VAWA and the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ079.108.pdf">Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003</a> (PREA) [text, PDF], but concluded that a lack of substantive protective legislation at both the federal and state levels combined with the poor implementation of current laws was resulting in the continued prevalence of violence against women and a discrimination against victims, particularly affecting women in the military, women in detention, Native American women and other women in poor and/or immigrant communities. The report further said that rates of abuse against women are higher among the African American, Native American and immigrant communities. Last year JURIST Senior Editor Brandon Gatto argued that the VAWA should be reauthorized to better <a href="/dateline/2012/04/brandon-gatto-vawa.php">protect immigrant partners and spouses from abuse</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the first part of her legal analysis, Judge Shira Scheindlin found that the plaintiffs, all of whom are African-American and Latino residents of New York City, possess proper standing for such injunctive relief under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">US Constitution</a> [texts] because the "frequency of alleged injuries inflicted by the practice...creates a likelihood of future injury sufficient to address standing concerns." She added that the risk of future injury to the plaintiffs from the stop-and-frisk program is "real and immediate." In her lengthier second legal analysis, Judge Scheindlin determined that the plaintiffs met all prerequisites of a class action lawsuit under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a> [text]. In particular, she concluded that the claims alleged were common and typical, numerous, adequate, and ascertainable. The <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/releases/Clean_Halls_complaint_3.28.12.PDF">lawsuit itself</a> [complaint, PDF] challenges the constitutionality of "Operation Clean Halls," which is part of the NYPD's broader "stop-and-frisk" policy that allows police to patrol private apartments all over New York City.

<p>Last month Scheindlin <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-1.php">lifted an order</a> [JURIST report] that previously required the NYPD to stop using its "stop-and-frisk" practice. There, the judge reasoned that complying with the former order would place an undue burden on the NYPD to train thousands of officers and their supervisors. Two weeks prior Scheindlin declared the "stop-and-frisk" policy <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-declares-nypd-stop-and-frish-policy-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] on grounds that it violates the protection against unreasonable search and seizures of the <a href="http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment4/amendment.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">backgrounder</a>]. There, she reasoned that officers were not first meeting their requirement of developing a reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk supposed trespassers. Scheindlin's original decision was the first federal ruling to find that the "stop-and-frisk" practice is unconstitutional, though the NYPD has recently received a great deal of scrutiny for various allegations of misconduct. In July, a report issued by a coalition of legal rights organizations said that the NYPD used excessive force and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nypd-used-excessive-force-and-violated-rights-of-protesters-report.php">violated the rights of protesters</a> [JURIST report] who participated in the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City. A month prior, a Muslim rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in New Jersey seeking to end the department's controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation. In May, following an investigation into the NYPD's surveillance program, New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that it did not violate the Constitution. In March, NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">fervently denied</a> [speech; <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_18_ny_times_is_wrong.shtml">press release</a>] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/tymoshenko-fined-by-2000-for-contempt-of-court-320370.html">assessed</a> [Kiev Post report] the fine after the hearing, which was being held in connection with an investigation of the murder of Ukrainian parliamentarian Yevhen Scherban, in which Tymoshenko is a suspect. Prosecutors allege that Tymoshenko contracted someone to kill Scherban. However, Tymoshenko claims the charges are <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_11_05_2012_03">fabricated</a> and the state is merely <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_30_05_2012_04">looking for a "scapegoat"</a> [press releases]. Tymoshenko was not present at this hearing and instead sent a letter on her behalf which the judge found to contain elements of contempt. 

<p>Tymoshenko's trial has been the subject of much controversy. Last month, the state <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/lawyer-for-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-under-criminal-investigation.php">began investigating</a> [JURIST report] her lawyer for several criminal charges. Tymoshenko has already been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison on corruption charges and is currently awaiting trial for charges of <a href="chase/2012/04/ukraine-ex-pm-on-trial-for-tax-evasion.php">tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. That trial has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] multiple times since it began in April. All of the controversy has encouraged criticism from the international community. In September the <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. It condemned the current Ukrainian president <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] for his role in the politically motivated imprisonment. In August the Ukrainian <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] upheld Tymoshenko's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">abuse of office conviction</a> [JURIST report], reasoning that there would be no basis to rule in favor of the former PM and that the prison sentence is appropriate considering the charges against her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tarek Qa'adan and Jafar Azzidine have been on hunger strike for 78 days and Samer Al-Issawi has been on partial hunger strike for 200 days to protest Israel's use of administrative detention. Pillay also expressed her own concerns as to Israel's use of administrative detention: "Persons detained must be charged and face trial with judicial guarantees in accordance with international standards, or be promptly released."  UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk went further and called for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12988&LangID=E">immediate release</a> [press release; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44134&Cr=&Cr1=#.URvvq6XWj3w">report</a>] of the three men. Falk called the conditions that the three men were being held under as "inhumane" and demanded that Israel either produce evidence against the men to bring charges or release them. Qa'adan and Azzidine are reportedly near death.

<p>Israel has been criticized for its treatment of Palestinian prisoners and going on hunger strike to protest administrative detention by Israeli authorities has recently become a common tactic by Palestinian prisoners. In June Falk called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-chief-calls-on-israel-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release two Palestinian detainees</a> [JURIST report] who have been on hunger strike for 82 and 58 days to protest their administrative detention. Earlier in June <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/israel-urged-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] of conscience and administrative detainees or immediately try them under international fair trial standards. In May UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-should-try-or-release-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-un.php">try or release more than 1,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who had been on hunger strike. Earlier that same month, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-supreme-court-declines-to-free-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] two detainees who had been on hunger strike in their appeal seeking release from detention. During the same month, Falk <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-israel-prison-conditions.php">expressed his concern</a> [JURIST report] for the continued human rights violations in Israel's prisons. He called on the country to comply with the international standards of how to treat detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The officials indicated that devices used to record audio and video were routinely placed throughout the detention center, but they were only used for security purposes. The surveillance devices were often concealed in common objects such as smoke detectors. The lawyers admitted that a person would not know they were under surveillance, but that the prosecuting lawyers did not review any of the recordings. Officials also indicated that some legal mailings had been opened and searched for contraband and then delivered to the detainee. They said that they did not read any of the documents.

<p>The procedures and policies regarding the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] military commission hearings have faced significant scrutiny. Earlier this month, a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-stop-to-911-hearing-censoring.php">ordered the removal</a> [JURIST report] of any monitoring system that censors the public broadcast of the hearings.

Azmi was brought to court on charges of illegally acquiring and concealing real estate gains and was sentenced in May 2011 to seven years in prison, along with a fine of 36.4 million Egyptian pounds. An appeals court ordered a retrial in Azmi's case earlier this month. A separate criminal court ruled that Azmi, who has been in detention for approximately 22 months, must now be released, as it is illegal to hold a suspect in prison for more than 18 months. He is still to abide by travel and financial restrictions, but will not be confined to his home. Four other high-ranking officials from Mubarak's fallen regime, including former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ahmed+Nazif">Ahmed Nazif</a> and former interior minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habib+el+adly">Habib el-Adly</a> [JURIST news archives], were also granted retrials on Wednesday. 

<p>Many former officials have stood trial since the end of Mubarak's 30-year regime. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and life sentence and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protestors in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, although their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud, using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sadi Bugingo <a href="http://www.newsinenglish.no/2013/02/14/court-convicts-rwandan-defendant/">moved</a> [Views from Norway report] to Norway in 1994 after the genocide and has been working as a janitor in Bergen. He was uncovered and arrested as a result of a May 2011 investigation. Bugingo argued he was not responsible for the killings and instead tried to save the individuals that were being targeted. However, the court relied on several witnesses in attributing killings in Berenga, Economat and Kibungo to Bugingo. Continuing to claim his innocence, Bugingo appealed immediately following the ruling. 

<p>Last month, a Rwandan genocide suspect was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France.

Kenyatta, a former finance minister, argues that his defense team <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/14/us-kenya-icc-idUSBRE91D0NG20130214">needs more time</a> [Reuters report] to respond to evidence revealed to them at the last minute leading up to the trial. The charges arise from Kenyatta's involvement in the violence following the disputed elections in December 2007 in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands more displaced. The trial is currently set to begin on April 11, just weeks after the upcoming presidential election. 

<p>Earlier this month Kenyatta and his co-defendant, former civil service chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case material], <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. The two Kenyans had <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in December that, despite their upcoming trials, they will be running together in the next presidential election, scheduled to take place next month. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a bipartisan effort, Michigan Republican <a href="mikerogers.house.gov/">Mike Rogers</a> and Maryland Democrat <a href="dutch.house.gov/">C.A. "Dutch" Ruppersberger</a> [official websites] brought forth the <a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/hr-3523-bill-and-amendments">Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act</a> (CISPA) [HR 3523 materials], a law designed to stop cyber attacks on US infrastructure as well as private companies. The bill's reintroduction comes only a day after <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity">executive order</a> [text] for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. While Rogers, Ruppersberger, and other lawmakers have promoted the bill as a mechanism to fight terrorism and protect the country from cyber attacks around the world, the bill's detractors, including several rights groups, have voiced concerns over personal privacy freedoms. Most notably, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/cispa">long denounced CISPA</a> [ACLU blog archive] as a law that "would create a loophole in all existing privacy laws ... without any legal oversight." In a statement on Wednesday, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-responds-executive-order-cybersecurity-opposes-cispa?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">declared</a> [press release] that Obama's executive order "rightly focuses on cybersecurity solutions that don't negatively impact civil liberties," and added that its opposition to CISPA stems from the act allowing "companies to share sensitive and personal American internet data with the government." The bill will now be assigned to a congressional committee before being sent to the entire House or <a href="www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website].

<p>Last April, the US House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/us-house-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">approved CISPA</a> [JURIST report] in a vote of 248-168. This occurred despite the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17864539">high probability of a veto</a> [BBC report] from Obama, who has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr3523r_20120425.pdf">asserted</a> [press release, PDF] that the law "fails to provide authorities" to protect American's infrastructure "without instituting corresponding privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties safeguards." Similarly, in March, Obama administration official <a href="www.justice.gov/oip/director-bio.htm">Melanie Ann Pustay</a> [official profile] testified before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/obama-administration-seeks-new-protections-for-cybersecurity-infrastructure-information.php">urge congressional officials</a> [JURIST report] to amend the <a href="www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] to strengthen government's ability to prevent disclosure of information related to critical infrastructure and cybersecurity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Jane Triche Milazzo of the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/14/us-usa-transocean-settlement-idUSBRE91D10720130214">accepted</a> [Reuters report] the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/transocean-plea-agreement.pdf">plea agreement</a> [text, PDF] saying the substantial penalty demonstrated the "deterrent effect of the plea process." The civil penalty is a record amount, and, in accordance with the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act), 80 percent of the penalty will be used to fund projects in the Gulf states for the environmental and economic benefit of the region. Additionally, Transocean must take measures to reduce the likelihood of another oil discharge. Transocean still has a pending settlement with a committee representing more than 100,000 individuals and business owners claiming damages from the spill, and the <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/uk-usa-transocean-settlement-idUKBRE9020H920130103">ultimate cost</a> [Reuters report] of the spill to Transocean could be $4 billion. 

<p>Thursday's settlement is the latest development in a series of legal battles over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill since January 2012 when a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] to share partial liability with Transocean in oil spill claims. Last December a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. Last November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge assumed his position in 2005 as the chief judge of the Supreme Judicial Council and the Supreme Federal Court. He now has 60 days to appeal the committee's decision or step down.

<p>After the US invasion of Iraq and the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/saddam-executed-iraqi-tv.php">execution of Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, the Iraqi government has been prosecuting and sentencing former officials who were closely associated with the former dictator's party. In July former Interior Minister Mahmoud Thiab al-Ahmed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/former-saddam-hussein-official-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] after serving an eight-year sentence for his part in draining the marshes in Southern Iraq. A month earlier, Abid Hamid Mahmud, a former bodyguard and secretary of Hussein, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/iraq-executes-former-saddam-hussein-bodyguard.php">executed</a> after he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-court-sentences-saddam-era-deputy-pm-aziz-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST reports] by hanging in 2010 alongside former Iraqi foreign minister and deputy prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2266978.stm">Tariq Aziz</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraqi+high+criminal+court">news archive</a>] and one other official. They were convicted of genocide in connection with his service under Hussein. The death sentences have led to controversy. Aziz, who was sentenced to death in 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/lawyers-for-saddam-era-deputy-PM-aziz-seek-death-sentence-pardon.php">sought a pardon of his sentence</a> [JURIST report] after Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Talabani">news archive</a>] said in an interview that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/iraq-president-refuses-to-approve-execution-of-ex-foreign-minister.php">would not sign the execution order</a> [JURIST report] for Aziz.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group of UN experts, including the Special Rapporteurs on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/SRTortureIndex.aspx">torture</a>, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">independence of judges and lawyers</a>, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">situation for human rights defenders</a>, and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">violence against women</a>, and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official websites], <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44141&Cr=venezuela&Cr1=#.UR0rVeilJjM">condemned the Venezuelan government</a> [UN News Centre] for continuing to hold Afiuni in pre-trial detention and called for an investigation into the incident. 

<p>Chavez continue to draw international criticism. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called on Venezuela to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-venezuela-should-end-censorship-media-intimidation.php">end censorship and intimidation</a> [JURIST report] of media that challenge official reports regarding Chavez. In July Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/venezuela-withdraws-from-human-rights-court.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Venezuela would withdraw from the <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=487586&CFTOKEN=78136649">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish]. In a statement during a military ceremony, Chavez announced the withdrawal and criticized the regional court, saying it is not fit to be called a human rights court. The decision came just after the IACHR concluded that the prison conditions of a man convicted in multiple bombings were a violation of his human rights. In 2011 Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/venezuela-president-criticizes-human-rights-court-ruling.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the IACHR for ruling in favor of presidential hopeful Leopoldo Lopez, allowing him to run for office despite a separate court ruling barring him from the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44138&Cr=&Cr1=#.UR1JlnfVp8G">proposed legislation</a> [UN News Centre report] would require organizations to register with the Ministry of Home Affairs and affirm that they believe in only one God and that they are not affiliated with a specific political party. The bill would also impose restrictions on the nature of discourse in which the groups can engage. The UN experts fear that if the bill is left unchanged it will inhibit freedom of assembly, speech and religion and ultimately undermine the nation's push toward democratization. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders</a> [official website] Margaret Sekaggya expressed her concern that "certain provisions in the bill will hamper the legitimate human rights work of civil society in the country, in particular of foreign societal organizations." The bill is scheduled for a vote next week.

<p>Indonesia has previously faced international criticism for undermining human rights. In November the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-indonesia-to-end-discrimination.php">urged Indonesia</a> [JURIST report] to end discrimination. In July an Indonesian cleric was imprisoned for <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/indonesia-cleric-imprisoned-for-violating-blasphemy-law.php">violating</a> [JURIST report] the nation's blasphemy law. The international community <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/indonesia-conviction-of-peaceful-activists-draws-international-criticism.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Indonesia last March for the arrest of peaceful demonstrators. In January 2011 three soldiers were <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/indonesia-soldiers-sentenced-over-torture-video.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] for their role in making a video showing the torture of detainees. In December 2010 rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/rights-group-urges-indonesia-to-repeal-laws-violating-human-rights.php">advocated</a> [JURIST report] for the repeal of two Sharia laws which imposed strict Islamic dress in public and prohibited unmarried men and women from being alone together.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The film, which sparked violent protests throughout the Middle East last year, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9604580/US-Filmmakers-banned-from-Britain-over-anti-Mohammed-video.html">depicts</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] the Prophet Mohammad as a sexual deviant. The NTRA argues that the court ruling is <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/14/us-egypt-youtube-idUKBRE91804Q20130214">unenforceable</a> [Reuters report] because it is impossible to shut down YouTube without affecting Google's Internet search, which would negatively impact Egypt's economy. The NTRA noted that while authorities have already taken steps to block the film within Egypt, only the US has the ability to shut down YouTube. 

<p>Innocence of Muslims has generated a great deal of political, religious and legal controversy. Last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentences of seven Coptic Christians and an American preacher on charges stemming from the film. In September an actress who claims she was duped into appearing in the film <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] requesting the film be removed from YouTube.

The senate voted 34-21 to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/illinois-senate-votes-legalize-gay-marriage-18504427">lift the ban</a> [AP report] on same-sex marriage in the state of Illinois. The bill, referred to as the Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act, was passed largely on party lines with only one Republican voting in favor of the legislation. Before voting on this legislation, the state senate adopted an amendment to the bill stating that religious organizations will not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages. The amendment also explicitly states that churches cannot be sued for prohibiting their parishes from performing same-sex marriages. The bill states: "All laws of this State applicable to marriage, whether they derive from statute, administrative or court rule, policy, common law, or any other source of civil or criminal law, shall apply equally to marriages of same-sex and different-sex couples and their children." If the Senate's bill is passed by the House and signed into law by Governor Pat Quinn, Illinois would be the tenth state to legalize same-sex marriage.

<p>Same-sex marriage is currently legal in nine states, as well as the District of Columbia. Last month, the Rhode Island House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText13/HouseText13/H5015A.pdf">bill</a> [H 5015, PDF] that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The bill passed by a vote of 51-19 after a lengthy debate on the House floor. Rhode Island is currently the only state in New England that has not legalized same-sex marriage, and previous attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in the predominantly Catholic state have been unsuccessful. Earlier in January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">received briefs</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases defending the constitutionality of laws that define marriage as strictly between one man and one woman. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] held that <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website], a US biotech firm, could patent the gene BRCA1 because the gene is not natural, but rather the product of human intervention. The plaintiffs in the case, <a href="http://www.cancervoicesaustralia.org/">Cancer Voices Australia</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/15/world/asia/australia-breast-cancer-gene-patent/">criticized the court ruling</a> [CNN report] as detrimental to cancer patients and argued that genes are products of nature that cannot be patented. Judge John Nicholas rejected the plaintiffs' argument, holding that although naturally occurring genes could not be patented, BRCA1 could be patented because it was artificially created:<blockquote>There is no doubt that naturally occurring DNA and RNA as they exist inside the cells of the human body cannot be the subject of a valid patent. However, the disputed claims do not cover naturally occurring DNA and RNA as they exist inside such cells. The disputed claims extend only to naturally occurring DNA and RNA which have been extracted from cells obtained from the human body and purged of other biological materials with which they were associated.</blockquote>The plaintiffs plan to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website]. 

<p>A similar gene patent case <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-gene-patent-case.php">is pending</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/12-398_ts.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Myriad Genetics in 2009, arguing that genes could not be patented because they are products of nature, and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/brca-genes-and-patents">patenting genes would violate the First Amendment</a> [ACLU backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, but the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-again-validates-cancer-gene-patents.php">reversed the ruling</a> [JURIST report] in August, saying that Myriad had a right to patent the isolated cells because they were "transformed" and Myriad's method of isolation included steps that were not naturally occurring. When asked to reconsider the case in light of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1150.pdf">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</a> [opinion, PDF], a case in which the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year to deny medical tests relying on correlations between drug dosages and treatment cannot be patented, the judges were split on how it applied and each stuck to his or her original decision on the outcome. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit has been brought against the government by the families of seven victims and eight wounded survivors, along with four human rights groups. <a href="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000077244&story_title=Post-election-violence-victims-sue-officers">According to the suit</a> [<em>Standard</em> report], unlawful orders were given to police, who had not been trained in lawful methods for dealing with the civil unrest that resulted from a dispute in the 2007 general elections. Kenya's police force has long been criticized by advocacy groups for ineffectiveness, corruption, and human rights violations. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/kenya0213webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] earlier this month entitled "High Stakes: Political Violence and the 2013 Elections in Kenya," in which it details the police shortcomings and rural violence that in 2012 and early 2013 alone have claimed more than 477 lives and displaced approximately 118,000 people. "Many of these incidents have been linked to pre-election maneuvering as local politicians mobilize support," the report stated. "The police and other authorities have repeatedly failed to prevent the violence or hold those responsible to account." The lawsuit comes as Kenya prepares for the March 4 election, which will be the country's first election since the eruption of the 2007 violence. Kenya's High Court announced Friday that it lacks the jurisdiction to determine whether presidential hopeful Uhuru Kenyatta and running mate William Ruto, who both face <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] trials for crimes against humanity, are eligible to run for office next month.

<p><a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">Allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] following the 2007 elections led to violence that caused the deaths of more than 1,000 people and displacement of 500,000 others, and remains a concern in the international community. The ICC initiated a formal investigation into the violence after Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/kenya-parliament-rejects-bills.php">failed to conduct</a> [JURIST report] its own investigation in 2009. In July 2012 the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sets-april-trial-date-for-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">set the trial dates</a> [JURIST report] for the post-election violence cases against Kenyatta, Ruto, journalist Joshua Arap Sang and former civil service chief Francis Muthaura. The trial of Ruto and Arap Sang is expected to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1439279.pdf">start </a>[decision, PDF] on April 10, while the trial of Kenyatta and Muthaura is to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1439275.pdf">begin</a> [decision, PDF] on April 11. In June, the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election. The four men have been accused and charged with involvement in the 2007 post-election violence. Ruto and Sang are facing three counts of murder, forcible transfer and persecution while Kenyatta and Muthaura are facing five counts of orchestrating murder, rape, forcible transfer and persecution in the polls' aftermath.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendments were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-cabinet-approves-changes-to-war-crime-laws.php">approved</a> in response to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">days of protests</a> [JURIST reports] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, the leader of the Islamist <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website] party, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for convictions including murder, rape and torture&#8212;a decision which the demonstrators assert is too lenient. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams denounced the retroactive amendments as a cynical ploy by the government to disregard unfavorable court decisions:<blockquote>Justice for victims of war crimes and other serious abuses during the 1971 war of liberation is essential. But a government supposedly guided by the rule of law cannot simply pass retroactive laws to overrule court decisions when it doesn't like them. The Bangladesh government should pause, take a deep breath, and repeal the proposed amendments, which make a mockery of the trial process.</blockquote>HRW also called on security forces in Bangladesh to restrict their use of deadly force to situations in which it is absolutely necessary.

<p>Mollah's sentence was the latest to be handed down for war crimes committed during the 1971 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/liberation-war.htm">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> (BLW) [advocacy website]. Last week, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-death-sentence-imposed-in-bangladesh.php">expressed concern</a> over a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-member-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST reports] that was handed down last month against Abul Kalam Azad, another former leader of JI, for similar war crimes. Both Azad and Mollah's sentences were handed down by Bangladesh's ICT, which was established in March 2010 specifically to hear cases involving war crimes during the BLW. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the UN's first <a href="http://www.un.md/key_doc_pub/Senior_Expert_Hammarberg_Report_TN_Human_Rights.pdf">human rights report</a> [text, PDF] on the contested region of Transnistria, which was released on Thursday, the de facto authorities should undertake thorough reform of the penitentiary system, including a reduction of the number of prisoners, the abolition of inhuman disciplinary measures in prisons and training of prison staff. The report's author, Thomas Hammarberg, also noted that steps should be made to harmonize Transnistria's legislation with international human rights law and people in the region, who have limited knowledge of Transnistria's <a href="http://president-pmr.org/category/14.html">Constitution</a> [text, in Russian] and other laws, should be granted greater access to legal documents. "Mr. Hammarberg's research in the Transnistrian region clearly demonstrates how the deployment of technical human rights experts can truly benefit people on the ground, without having a bearing on issues of political recognition or the legal status of a territory," UN High Commissioner on Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said of the report.

<p>Transnistria is a territory located between Ukraine and Moldova. It is de jure a part of Moldova, but has had de facto independence since the early 1990s. In 1990, the region announced its intention to succeed from Moldova to become the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR). Between 1990 and 1992 at least 700 people were killed in fighting between Transnistrian separatists and Moldova. In a 2006 referendum that was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353302.stm">not recognized by the international community</a> [BBC report], 97 percent of the people in the region voted for independence and expressed support for a plan to eventually joining Russia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to media sources, voters will be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-14/pennsylvania-aclu-reach-voter-id-accord-for-may-election-1-.html">asked to present ID</a> [Bloomberg report], but may decline to do so. The temporary agreement <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">extends an October ruling</a> [JURIST report] by a <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court/">Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court</a> [official website] judge enjoining enforcement of the state's <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2011&sind=0&body=H&type=B&bn=934">voter ID law</a> [HB 943 materials] for November's presidential election. Supporters of the proposed legislation say that it will combat voter fraud, but opponents fear that it will disenfranchise poor, elderly and minority voters who may find it difficult to obtain a photo ID. According to sources, the law has the potential to exclude nearly 800,000 eligible voters. The lawsuit is set to go to trial on July 15.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a contentious issue in the US. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/PetitionApplewhite.pdf">challenged the law</a> [petition for review, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-challenged.php">report</a>] in May, asking a court to block enforcement of the law for the November elections. The group claimed that the law violates the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/wu01/vc/visitor_info/creating/constitution.cfm">Pennsylvania Constitution</a> [text] and will prevent eligible voters from casting their votes. Pennsylvania Governor Corbett <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/pennsylvania-governor-signs-voter-id-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] in March. It was passed earlier that week in the House of Representatives by a vote of 104-88. In November, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-judge-refuses-to-block-voter-id-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court upholding the state's new voter identification law and remanded for further consideration. Unlike the current trend of voter ID laws, Pennsylvania's allows voters to vote without an ID as long as they verify their identity within six days of voting. Absentee ballots will also only require identification by Social Security number. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">32 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, but the issue remains controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/ldsh/contact.htm">Independent Center for Privacy Protection</a> [advocacy website], known in Germany as the ULD, brought the suit against the Palo Alto, California-based company <a href="https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/presse/20121217-facebook-real-names.htm">alleging violation</a> [press release] of German data protection laws in place to protect the fundamental right to freedom of expression on the Internet. The <a href="http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/OVG/EN/OVG_node.html">Administrative Court of the State of Schleswig-Holstein</a> [official website] held that the ULD <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2028296/facebook-can-keep-real-name-policy-german-court-rules.html">wrongly based</a> [PCWorld report] its challenge on German law, stating that Facebook's handling of marketing and acquisition in Germany prevented the court from ruling on its data and personal information processing, an activity that is handled at the company's offices in Dublin, Ireland. According to the state regulator, the ULD is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-15/facebook-scores-win-in-legal-regime-dispute-with-germany.html">expected to appeal</a> [Bloomberg report] the decision. 

<p>Facebook has faced numerous legal challenges in its near decade-long history. Aside from the company's major settlements with Eduardo Saverin and the Winklevoss twins, privacy advocacy groups <a href="http://epic.org">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> and the <a href="http://www.democraticmedia.org">Center for Digital Democracy</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/privacy-groups-challenge-facebook-data-policy-changes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] CEO Mark Zuckerberg in November to withdraw privacy changes, claiming that the alterations may violate a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ftc-and-facebook-settle-privacy-dispute.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website]. In August German data privacy authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-reopens-privacy-investigation-into-facebook-facial-recognition-software.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into Facebook's facial recognition software, taking issue with the website's ability to automatically recognize individuals' facial features in pictures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Cecile Pouilly, spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], the fact-finding mission will <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/radio/english/2013/02/on-the-ground-mission-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses-in-mali/">investigate</a> [press release] allegations of retaliatory violence. In January British and US militaries <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/02/15/UN-probing-rights-situation-in-Mali/UPI-54031360945846/">provided logistical support</a> [UPI report] for a French intervention in Mali, targeting militant Islamist groups. 

<p>Mali has drawn increased international scrutiny recently, particularly from the UN as more reports of political violence and human rights abuses come to light. Earlier this month UN Special Advisor on the Prevention of Genocide <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/adviser.shtml">Adama Dieng</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-genocide-adviser-warns-of-increased-risk-of-ethnic-violence-in-mali.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of an increased risk of reprisal attacks against ethnic Tuareg and Arab civilian populations in the northern regions of Mali. In January the International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-prosecutor-warns-mali-on-human-rights-abuses.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the Malian government over reports of human rights abuses by Malian forces. In the statement, Bensouda urged Malian authorities to put an immediate stop to the alleged abuses and to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Bensouda announced that her office has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

SB 1256 requires that voters present a photo ID that lists their address, such as a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/voter-id-bill-heads-to-mcdonnell/2013/02/15/de58ba54-779a-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">driver's license, passport or workplace photo ID</a> [WP report]. HB 1337 removes utility bills and paychecks from the list of acceptable forms of voter ID. <a href="http://www.ltgov.virginia.gov/">Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling</a> [official website] provided the tie-breaking votes in the Senate to pass both bills. Bolling voted for the bills, but also passed amendments offered by Democrats to delay their implementation. The bills will now head to the Republican-controlled Virginia House, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/virginia-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-limit-acceptable-voter-id-documents.php">approved similar legislation</a> [JURIST report] last week.

<p>Virginia's new laws mark the second time in two years that the Commonwealth has altered voting regulations. In August <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/doj-department-approves-virginia-voter-id-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had approved Virginia's voter ID law involving voting procedures, finding that the law did not violate the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> [text]. Prior to the law, the Commonwealth required ID at the polls, but allowed voters to cast ballots without it if they signed an affidavit swearing their identity. That law eliminated the affidavit option while adding several other acceptable forms of ID, all of which would be removed by the new new legislation. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">more than 30 US States</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 17 states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. The issue remains legally controversial, most notably in <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-supreme-court-expedites-challenge-to-state-voter-id-law.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/wisconsin-ag-to-ask-state-supreme-court-to-reinstate-voter-id-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-supreme-court-allows-voter-id-question-on-november-ballot.php">Minnesota</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The terms are set to run concurrently, and Prince Taylor will serve a total of 30 months from October 2012, when he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/charles-taylor-defense-investigator-arrested-on-contempt-charges.php">arrested on charges of contempt</a> [JURIST report]. Prince Taylor was <a href="/paperchase/Prince%20Taylor%20--%20Judgment.pdf">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF; APO <a href="http://appablog.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/special-court-for-sierra-leone-former-special-court-investigator-convicted-of-interference-with-witnesses/">press release</a>] on January 25 on five of nine counts of contempt of court for witness tampering.

<p>The SCSL was created in a joint endeavor by the government of Sierra Leone and the UN to provide a forum to try those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law, committed in Sierra Leone. With the recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Charles Taylor, the SCSL has largely fulfilled its mission and will take steps to shut down. Steps have already been taken to facilitate this process. In November 2009, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">handed over its detention facility</a> [JURIST report] to the Sierra Leone Prison Service in a monumental step towards the court's resolution. The month before, eight men judged guilty of war crimes by the court were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-transfers.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Rwanda to serve out their terms. Although the court is winding down, it is still active. In early October, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences-four-for-contempt.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four men to prison terms ranging from 18 months to 2 years on contempt charges stemming from allegations of witness tampering. The month before, the court found three members of Sierra Leone's former Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/09/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-convicts-three-of-contempt.php">guilty of contempt</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

These amendments are a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">response to protests</a> [JURIST report] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, leader of the Islamist <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamatt-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website], was given a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War (BLW). The protesters believed a life sentence was too lenient and that Mollah, who was convicted of charges including murder, rape and torture, should have been given the death penalty. Previously, only defendants had the right to appeal sentences they believed were too harsh. The law passed by parliament on Sunday will be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladeshs-parliament-amends-war-crimes-law-18523564">effective retroactively</a> [AP report] to July 2009, allowing prosecutors to appeal Mollah's sentence.

<p>These amendments have been criticized by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], which said last week that they <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-post-trial-amendments-threaten-legitimacy-of-bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal.php">threaten the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of the country's war crimes tribunal.

The second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal</a> [Facebook page], which convicted and sentenced Mollah and Azad, in Bangladesh was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to investigate and prosecute crimes committed during the BLW.</p>]]></content:encoded>

News of the sentences was <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/system/wire/CNG---b974624f7b768f7edf345b0b0d37ae73---7d1">released in a statement</a> [AFP report] by the Center of Judicial Information, an office affiliated with the <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Argentina Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish], on Saturday. The seven officers were found guilty on charges of kidnapping, torture and homicide for their treatment of 69 prisoners who were held at a navy base in Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Four members of the navy were also sentenced to 25, 14, 12 and three years in prison, and two top police prefects were sentenced to 14 and 10 years for related human rights abuses. The case was originally brought against 16 people by the relatives of victims and human rights groups, but two of the defendants died and another was absolved for health reasons while awaiting trial.

<p>The "Dirty War" was a seven-year military dictatorship, under which many government opponents as well as ordinary citizens were "disappeared" and taken to government facilities to be tortured and eventually killed. In December an Argentine court sentenced former Interior Minister Jaime Smart to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for murder and detention of citizens. Smart was the first civilian minister to be convicted of crimes during the "Dirty War," but other civilians and police officers had been previously convicted. Two of Argentina's former dictators were also convicted in July of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/argentina-sentences-former-dictators-for-kidnapping-children-during-war.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] during the war and sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison.

The plan reportedly would also increase security funding, require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years, and create a new "Lawful Prospective Immigrant" visa program. If approved for the new visa, immigrants could also apply for the same status for spouses and children who live outside the US. Approved immigrants would be allowed to reside legally in the US for four years, to obtain work and to leave the country for brief time periods. They would also be given a new identification demonstrating their legal status and could apply for legal permanent residence within eight years, which would further allow them to apply for citizenship. Immigrants with certain criminal offenses could be disqualified from the program. Senator <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/">Marco Rubio</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=d4fde88b-eaa1-4bd8-8ff1-8b79b689c86d">criticized</a> [text] the draft and stated that it would be "dead on arrival" if it were actually proposed before Congress. President Barack Obama's Chief of Staff, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/staff/denis-mcdonough">Denis McDonough</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/us/politics/white-house-continues-work-on-its-own-immigration-bill.html">confirmed</a> [NYT report] that the administration privately drafted an immigration bill in the event that Congress ultimately fails to agree on their own version, but said the White House is continuing to work with a bipartisan group of senators to draft reform legislation. The White House has declined to confirm <em>USA Today</em>'s report of the details of the plan.

<p>Immigration reform has been a recent focus for the US government. In January a bipartisan group of eight senators, including Rubio, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-senators-unveil-immigration-reform-plan.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/_files/_pdfs/Framework%20For%20Immigration%20Reform.pdf">framework</a> [text, PDF]  of comprehensive immigration reform legislation that they plan to introduce by March. The framework focuses on four "pillars" that the legislation will include: creating a path to citizenship for current unauthorized immigrants, contingent upon securing the borders; reforming the immigration system to ease the way for immigrants who will bolster the US economy or are a part of an existing US family and have been waiting for citizenship; creating a new employment verification system to check immigration status; and allowing immigrants to legally immigrate to the US for low-skilled labor, only if it is available and American workers have refused the work. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/28/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-1282013">stated</a> [press release] that "[T]he President welcomes the efforts by the bipartisan group in the Senate to put forward principles on the need for comprehensive immigration reform&#8212;principles that mirror the President's blueprint."</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the court must ratify the legislation before it can be enacted by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>], the court has remanded the law to Egypt's acting legislature to <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/65056/Egypt/Politics-/Constitutional-court-rejects-articles-in-draft-par.aspx">amend five specific articles</a> [<em>Ahram Online</em> report] to which the court objected. The law will now return to the Shura Council, the upper house of parliament that assumed full legislative powers on a temporary basis when the lower house People's Assembly was dissolved by court order in June. It has yet to be determined if the April parliamentary elections will be delayed while the law is redrafted.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the beginning of the revolution. Earlier this month the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the legislative constitutional assembly that recently drafted a new charter was legitimate. The judges claimed a crowd of Islamists outside the courthouse of had intimidated the judges and blocked the entrance to the courthouse. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] in late January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protests throughout the country. Earlier in January Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in cities a day after nationwide unrest compounded following an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges against Nasheed stem from his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges in January, when Nasheed was still president. Nasheed remains in the Indian embassy, where he fled last Wednesday to escape an <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/maldives-court-issues-2nd-warrant-ex-president">arrest warrant</a> [AP report] for failing to appear to face the charges against him. Nasheed claims that the charges against him are <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/02/2013213132554617868.html">politically motivated</a> [Al Jazeera report], arguing that his successor, current President Mohamed Waheed, will not hold a fair election. The Indian foreign ministry said that it was currently in touch with Maldivian authorities in efforts to resolve the situation. In the mean time, the ministry calls on Waheed to hold a fair election.

<p>In October Nasheed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/maldives-ex-president-arrested-after-violating-court-imposed-travel-ban.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] for leaving the capital city of Male in contravention of a court summons and a court-imposed travel ban. Nasheed twice failed to appear in court to face abuse of power charges. Earlier in October a three-judge panel was forced to postpone the first day of Nashed's trial after he <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/maldives-ex-president-violates-travel-ban-fails-to-appear-in-court.php">violated his travel ban</a> [JURIST report], leaving Male in a boat that day in order to campaign in the Maldives' southern islands. A week earlier the Hulhumale Magistrate Court had issued an order <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/maldives-court-restricts-ex-president-to-capital.php">prohibiting Nasheed from leaving the city</a> [JURIST report] without official permission. Nasheed's supporters claimed that the move was politically motivated to limit the ex-president's ability to campaign for the election scheduled for November 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the Commission, government forces have utilized a "contraction strategy" to target suspected rebel areas with indiscriminate aerial attacks that have struck hospitals, bakeries and bread lines. In addition, government forces have allegedly exploited house searches and road checkpoints to murder, torture, rape, and "disappear" rebels and civilians. Conversely, anti-government forces allegedly continued to conduct operations in civilian areas, where the Commission reports that car and suicide bombings have been directed at non-military targets, and children as young as 15 have been conscripted into service. The Commission said that these act have created widespread and systematic terror among the civilian population. The Syrian government has not allowed the Commission to perform investigations inside Syria, and the report is based on 445 interviews conducted over the past two years:<blockquote>The depth of the Syrian tragedy is poignantly reflected in the accounts of its victims. Their harrowing experiences of survival detail grave human rights violations, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The destructive dynamics of the civil war not only have an impact on the civilian population but are also tearing apart the country's complex social fabric, jeopardizing future generations and undermining peace and security in the entire region.</blockquote>The HRC <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13003&LangID=E">emphasized</a> [press release] the "urgent need" for both sides to come to a political settlement so that violence will cease. According to the report and media sources, the Commission is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/02/2013218104042830191.html">compiling a list of individual suspects</a> [Al Jazeera report] in hopes of referring charges to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The report will be presented to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] in March.

<p><br />
The Syrian government has been in conflict with the anti-government forces since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. The conflict arose out of revolt against <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder], which began with peaceful protests that quickly turned into violence between Assad's forces and demonstrators. This month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the death toll resulting from two years of armed conflict in Syria is approaching 70,000. Last month more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC. A study carried out by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in January that the average number of deaths per month has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">increased significantly</a> [JURIST report] since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012. A UN official said in November that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Pillay called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report]. In September UN investigators <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number and frequency of human rights violations committed by both sides of the conflict were increasing rapidly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In October, after several months of investigating, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/eu-authorities-urge-google-to-clarify-privacy-policy.php">27 EU states warned</a> [JURIST report] Google that its confidentiality rules do not comply with EU law and gave the company four months to implement recommendations from the EU data protection agencies. The recommendations included improving data subjects' information, clarifying the combination of data across Google's services, and providing precise retention periods for the personal data it processes. CNIL also noted that Google has failed to provide any precise and effective answers within the four-month deadline. Committed to act and continue their investigations, EU data protection authorities designed an action plan, led by CNIL, to coordinate their repressive action during a meeting in Paris last month. It will be submitted to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/index_en.htm">Article 29 Working Party</a> [materials] for approval during the next plenary meeting on February 26.

<p>Google has faced many legal challenges regarding the privacy of internet users. In December an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned a conviction of Google executives</a> [JURIST report] for privacy violations from allowing a bullying video to be posted on its site. In November the company was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php">fined $22.5 million</a> [JURIST report] for alleged privacy misrepresentations concerning Apple's Safari Internet browser. In February 2012 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a suit filed by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, that asked the <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to block <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's proposed privacy changes</a> [text] that would allow a user's information to be shared among several Google products, including YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009, was a lawyer for the <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Fund</a> [corporate website] and was arrested in 2008 by <a href="http://eng.mvdrf.ru/">Russian Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in English] officials on suspicion of tax evasion after he accused the ministry of embezzling USD $230 million from the state. State prosecutors <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/dead-russian-whistleblower-set-day-court-18527604">accuse</a> [AP report] Magnitsky and a former client of evading $16.8 million in taxes. Magnitsky's family and lawyers have refused to attend the trial claiming the charges are politically motivated.

<p>Magnitsky's death while in custody has caused a rift in Russia's relationship with the US. In December US lawmakers passed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text] in the lawyer's name, which will allow the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">US Secretary of the Treasury</a> [official website] to freeze assets, prohibit all transactions and deny visas to Russians implicated in human rights abuses. Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] in December <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that prohibits US citizens from adopting Russian children, possibly in retaliation. Also In December a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/moscow-court-acquits-prison-doctor-in-death-of-russian-whistleblower.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] prison doctor Dmitry Kratov of all charges stemming from Magnitsky's death, with the judge finding no evidence showing a causal link between Kratov's negligence and Magnitsky's death. Kratov was the head of medical services at Butyrka Prison, where Magnitsky died from untreated pancreatitis. An investigation conducted by Russia's Presidential Council on Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption,%20torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that in addition to being denied medical treatment Magnitsky had been severely beaten during his year long pretrial incarceration. Kratov was accused of negligence for allegedly refusing to respond to repeated requests by Magnitsky to treat his life-threatening condition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmexico.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Supreme Court of Mexico</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Monday published the written <a href="http://www2.scjn.gob.mx/ConsultaTematica/PaginasPub/DetallePub.aspx?AsuntoID=143969">judgment</a> [materials, in Spanish] for its December decision striking down Oaxaca's same-sex marriage ban. In its reasoning the Mexican high court compared the Oaxaca law to US legislation held to be unconstitutional in two US Supreme Court cases. First, in the 1967 case <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0388_0001_ZO.html">Loving v. Virigina</a> [opinion text], the US Supreme Court held that a state law banning interracial marriages, based solely on racial classifications, violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. Second, in the 1954 case <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZO.html">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</a> [opinion text], the Court held that laws requiring or permitting racial segregation in public schools also violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause. The Supreme Court of Mexico compared the racial discrimination in these US cases to the discriminatory nature of same-sex marriage bans, holding that such laws discriminate by depriving same-sex couples both of the right to marry and of the right to marital benefits. Moreover, the court stated that under such laws the children of same-sex couples face discrimination by receiving treatment different from that received by children of heterosexual couples. The court's ruling mandates that in accordance with principles of equity, the Oaxaca civil code must be written to describe marriage as between two people.

<p>The Mexican Supreme Court made its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/mexico-high-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-ban-in-oaxaca.php">unanimous decision</a> [JURIST report] on the Oaxaca case in December, but refrained from publishing its written judgment until this week. In the US same-sex marriage is currently legal in nine states, as well as the District of Columbia. Last week the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/senate/">Illinois State Senate</a> [official website] voted 34-21 to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">lift the ban on same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in the state of Illinois. Last month the <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/representatives/default.aspx">Rhode Island House of Representatives</a> [official website] by a 51-19 margin <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in the Rhode Island. Later this year the US Supreme Court will likely decide the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">constitutionality of state and federal laws</a> [JURIST report] defining marriage strictly as the union of one man and one woman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germanys-highest-court-strengthens-adoption-rights-for-gay-couples-in-civil-partnerships/2013/02/19/8dd30d3e-7a7c-11e2-9c27-fdd594ea6286_story.html">challenge to the existing adoption rules</a> [AP report] was brought by a woman who was denied permission to adopt a Bulgarian girl previously adopted by the woman's same-sex partner. The court held the existing rules to be a violation of equality principles and ordered the legislature to amend the law by June 2014. Previously a same-sex partner in a civil union could only adopt the biological children of his or her partner. <a href="http://www.bmj.de/EN/Minister/_doc/Min_doc.html">Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger</a> [official profile] was present for the ruling, branding the judgment as a <a href="http://www.bmj.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/DE/2013/20130219_Urteilsverkuendung_Sukzessivadoption.html?nn=3433226">historic step</a> [press release, in German] that provides legal certainty for the children of same-sex couples.

<p>Germany has recognized same-sex civil unions since 2001, but there are still certain rights that they do not share with heterosexual married couples. In August the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-constitutional-court-rules-equal-tax-benefits-for-same-sex-couples.php">same-sex couples in a civil union</a> [JURIST report] should receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual married couples with regard to land transfer tax, further noting that the decision should apply retroactively. That ruling came during the same month that 13 members of the country's ruling <a href="http://www.cdu.de/">Christian Democratic Union</a> (CDU) [party website, in German] called for same-sex couples to be granted joint-filing tax benefits.

Gbagbo's lawyers urged the court to rule that the ICC does not have jurisdiction, and that Gbagbo should be tried by the Ivory Coast authorities currently conducting their own investigation. Gbagbo has been accused of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/prosecutors-lay-out-crimes-against-humanity-evidence-against-former-ivory-coast-president/2013/02/19/13648f1a-7a76-11e2-9c27-fdd594ea6286_story.html">crimes against humanity</a> [AP report] including murder, rape and persecution. Currently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/19/us-icc-gbagbo-idUSBRE91I0O420130219">scheduled to testify</a> [Reuters report] late next week, Gbagbo will be asked to speak to his involvement in the post-2010 election civil war that resulted in the death of approximately 3,000 people. Gbagbo is the first former head of state to be tried by the ICC.

<p>In December the Appeals Chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icc-confirms-jurisdiction-over-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">dismissed a challenge by Gbagbo</a> [JURIST report] that alleged the court lacks jurisdiction over him. In November the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">unsealed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo's wife, Simone, marking the first time that the court has charged a female. In October the ICC denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance to leave</a> the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> in November [JURIST reports]. The court denied Gbagbo's leave request upon a determination that he posed a flight risk. The violence that followed the 2010 election displaced millions of people from their homes in addition to the thousands of lives lost. Gbagbo's rival <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">Alassane Ouattara</a> [JURIST news archive] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Committee <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/iraq-chief-judge-removed-from-office-over-ties-to-saddam-hussein.php">decided remove al-Mahmoud</a> [JURIST report] last over alleged ties to Saddam Hussein's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath party</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baath+party">news archive</a>]. The judicial panel, which reviews decisions made by the Justice and Accountability Committee, did not find strong evidence of the alleged ties and <a href="http://www.modbee.com/2013/02/19/2584437/iraq-panel-clears-senior-judge.html">rejected al-Mauhoud's dismissal</a> [AP report]. Al-Mahmoud was chosen by the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority as a supervisor for the Justice Ministry, and in 2005 he became head of both the Supreme Federal Court and the Supreme Judicial Council that oversees courts nationwide. In a separate decision earlier last week al-Mahmoud was removed from the Supreme Judicial Council so that he could remain head of Supreme Federal Court, as required by a new law.

<p>After the US invasion of Iraq and the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/saddam-executed-iraqi-tv.php">execution of Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, the Iraqi government has been prosecuting and sentencing former officials who were closely associated with the former dictator's party. In July former Interior Minister Mahmoud Thiab al-Ahmed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/former-saddam-hussein-official-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] after serving an eight-year sentence for his part in draining the marshes in Southern Iraq. A month earlier, Abid Hamid Mahmud, a former bodyguard and secretary of Hussein, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/iraq-executes-former-saddam-hussein-bodyguard.php">executed</a> after he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-court-sentences-saddam-era-deputy-pm-aziz-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST reports] by hanging in 2010 alongside former Iraqi foreign minister and deputy prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2266978.stm">Tariq Aziz</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraqi+high+criminal+court">news archive</a>] and one other official. They were convicted of genocide in connection with his service under Hussein. The death sentences have led to controversy. Aziz, who was sentenced to death in 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/lawyers-for-saddam-era-deputy-PM-aziz-seek-death-sentence-pardon.php">sought a pardon of his sentence</a> [JURIST report] after Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Talabani">news archive</a>] said in an interview that he <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/iraq-president-refuses-to-approve-execution-of-ex-foreign-minister.php">would not sign the execution order</a> [JURIST report] for Aziz.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Tuesday, the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee will begin to consider the revised version of this bill as well as another bill that would <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/249439/2/Ark-panel-tries-again-with-12-week-abortion-ban-">restrict abortions after 12 weeks</a> [AP report]. Current state law prohibits abortions after 25 weeks of gestation.

<p>Though Beebe has yet to comment on his plans regarding this bill, he has said that he would veto an earlier <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">bill</a> [SB 134, PDF] banning all abortions after the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">detection of a fetal heartbeat</a> [JURIST report]. This bill has failed to garner enough votes to pass the House. The current proposed legislation would make Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Knox delivered his remarks in Nairobi at the <a href="http://www.unep.org/gc/gc27/">First Universal Session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum</a> [official website], a gathering hosted by the <a href="http://www.unep.org/">UN Environmental Programme</a> (UNEP) [official website] this week. Knox urged global governments to utilize recommendations formulated by international organization and UN conferences, specifically <a href="http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/index.html">Rio +20</a> [official website], when creating environmental regulations in order to best protect the rights of vulnerable populations. He also warned world governments of the dangers of inaction:<blockquote>When governments around the world fail to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases, jeopardizing the continued existence of, among others, vulnerable communities in the Arctic and in low-lying coastal areas, they fail to protect many human rights, including rights to life, health, property, and development.</blockquote>Knox will present a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in March detailing the issues he will confront in performing his obligations to study and make recommendations about interrelated human rights and environmental issues.

<p>The UN is regularly confronted with issues at the intersection of human and environmental rights. In January more than 140 nations gathered at a UN forum <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/nations-reach-agreement-on-treaty-addressing-mercury-use.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a legally binding treaty addressing the use of mercury, a metal that is infamous for its detrimental effects on health and the environment. Last June, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] and UNEP issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/human-rights-environmental-laws-necessary-for-sustainable-development-un-report.php">joint report</a> [JURIST report] highlighting the need for the implementation of integrative human rights and environmental protection laws and policies to achieve sustainable development. The report stated that the "protection of the environment and the promotion of human rights are increasingly seen as intertwined" and that individuals from poor countries are more vulnerable to diseases and other basic need insecurities as a direct result of the ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that an alert from a well-trained narcotics detection dog certified to detect illegal contraband is sufficient to establish probable cause for the search of a vehicle. The ruling reversed the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2011/sc08-1871.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that training alone is insufficient to establish the reliability of the dog and that further information, such as field performance records indicating how often the dog falsely alerted, is required. In order for police officers to establish probable cause under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text], there must be a "fair probability" that the contraband or evidence of a crime is present, which is determined by the "totality of the circumstances." Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Elena Kagan noted that while the Supreme Court has rejected a rigid rule in favor of a flexible test, the "Florida Supreme Court flouted this established approach to determining probable cause ... [and] created a strict evidentiary checklist, whose every item the State must check off." Rejecting the "comprehensive documentation" requirement imposed by the Florida Supreme Court, the US Supreme Court established that a dog's satisfactory performance in a certification or training program can sufficiently establish the trustworthiness of its alert and held that in this instance, the defendant failed to introduce evidence that the certification or training was inadequate. 

<p>In January 2012 the court granted <em>certiorari</em> in the related case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/florida-v-jardines/">Florida v. Jardines</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to determine whether the use of a drug-sniffing dog at the front door of a house is a search under the Fourth Amendment requiring probable cause. The Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://grommit.com/blogs/ranga/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/jardines-fl_sct_op.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that such a search did require probable cause. The Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-564.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-drug-sniffing-dogs.php">report</a>] in the case in October, and a decision is pending. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Phoebe Putney Health Systems, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that federal antitrust laws regulating competition among health service providers apply to an anticompetitive transaction in Georgia because the state law regulating the activity did not clearly articulate authority for the entities to act anti-competitively. In this case, a government entity created by the state, using the general corporate powers given to it by the state, acquired the only competitor hospital of a private actor and then transferred control of that hospital to the private actor, effectively eliminating competition and creating a private monopoly. The court recognized that the principle of state-action immunity prevents federal antitrust laws from applying to states when they impose "market restraints as an act of government," and that this immunity may extend to non-state actors that are carrying out state regulations. It ruled, however, that the law in question failed the "clear-articulation test" because it was not made clear by the state that this type of action was contemplated and authorized by the state. In her opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that "given the fundamental national values of free enterprise and economic competition that are embodied in the federal antitrust laws, state-action immunity is disfavored," and should only be applied when actions are taken "pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively express state policy to displace competition."

<p>The court remanded the case to determine whether the FTC and Georgia could continue their lawsuit against the entity responsible for the transaction pursuant to the Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/41">Federal Trade Commission Act</a> [text], which prohibits transactions that substantially reduce competition among acute-care medical service providers. This ruling reversed the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/desktop/public/document/FTC_v_Phoebe_Putney_Health_Sys_Inc_663_F3d_1369_11th_Cir_2011_Cou">opinion</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], which ruled that state-action immunity applied and the actions of the entity were protected from federal law. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the petitioners also posed the question of whether, despite state-action immunity, the state policy at issue would be sufficient to validate the government entity's sale of the hospital, at the behest of a private actor, when the entity neither negotiated the terms of the sale nor had any oversight of the hospital's operations. Because the Court determined that state-action immunity did not apply, it did not address this question in its opinion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chafin</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-international-child-abduction-case.php">report</a>] that a parent can appeal a custody ruling when a district court has determined the child's habitual residence is another country and the child has already been removed from the US. The issue in this case stems from a custody dispute between US Army Sergeant Jeffrey Lee Chafin and his Scottish wife, Lynn Chafin. A district court ruled that, under the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text], their child's habitual place of residence was Scotland, so Mrs. Chafin moved there and took the child with her. The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Chafin_v_Chafin_No_1115355CC_2012_BL_231213_11th_Cir_Feb_06_2012_">ruled</a> [opinion] earlier this year to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was moot. Chief Justice John Roberts held that an order from an appeals court to a district court would not be moot despite the unlikeliness of compliance of a foreign jurisdiction with a district court's return order. Roberts wrote:<blockquote>Enforcement of the order may be uncertain if Ms. Chafin chooses to defy it, but such uncertainty does not typically render cases moot. Courts often adjudicate disputes where the practical impact of any decision is not assured. ... Courts also decide cases against foreign nations, whose choices to respect final rulings are not guaranteed. ... The Hague Convention mandates the prompt return of
children to their countries of habitual residence.  But such return does not render this case moot; there is a live dispute between the parties over where their child will be raised, and there is a possibility of effectual relief for the prevailing parent. The courts below therefore continue to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the parties&#8217; respective claims.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer in a concurring opinion. Ginsburg wrote, "the advent of rival custody proceedings in Scotland and Alabama is just what the Convention aimed to stave off. This case highlights the need for both speed and certainty in Convention decisionmaking. Most Contracting States permit challenges to first instance return orders." The opinion advocated quick judicial action in these cases.

In <a href = "http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_mccutcheon_notice_app.pdf">McCutcheon v. FEC</a> [notice of appeal, PDF; <a href = "http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/McCutcheon.shtml">case materials</a>] the court will consider whether the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/chapter-14">Federal Election Campaign Act</a> (FECA) [text] limit on individual contributions should be found unconstitutional as unsupported by a sufficient government interest. The court previously held in <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Buckley+v.+Valeo&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=11397892430187334248&scilh=0">Buckley v. Valeo</a> [opinion] that limits on contributions implicate First Amendment interests, but that limits may be imposed as long as they are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important governmental interest. Shaun McCutcheon and the <a href = "http://www.gop.com/?source=continue-text">Republican National Committee</a> (RNC) [advocacy website] argue that the limit&#8212;up to $2,500 per election to federal candidates, up to $30,800 per calendar year to a national party committee, up to $5,000 per calendar year to any non-party political committee, with an aggregate limit of $117,000&#8212;is too low and not supported by a sufficient governmental interest because the <a href = "http://www.fec.gov">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website] failed to show a specific, rather than generalized, risk of constitutional interference. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href = "http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/mccutcheon_dc_memo_opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] for the FEC suggesting the limits on spending were a purely legislative issue. In this case, the Supreme Court did not grant <em>certiorari</em> but accepted appeal under probable jurisdiction.

<p>The court granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/12-417-Sandifer-Petition-for-Certiorari.pdf">Sandifer v. United States Steel Corporation</a> [cert. petition, PDF] on the limited question: What constitutes "changing clothes" within the meaning of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/203">Section 203(o)</a> [text] of the <a href = "http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-flsa.htm">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [materials]? The law, under the definition for "hours worked," states that employers should "exclude any time spent in changing clothes." A class action of 800 employees from US Steel argue that they should be compensated for the time they spend changing in and out of safety equipment, because that is not what was intended by "clothes" under the act. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=678+F.3d+590&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=4314474933022862938&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] that changing into work clothes is not excluded by the act: "From a worker's standpoint any time spent on the factory grounds is time 'at work' in the sense of time away from home or some other place where he might prefer to be if he weren't at work. But it is not time during which he is making steel, and so it is not time for which the company will willingly pay."</p>

<p>Also Tuesday, the Supreme Court denied stays in two cases. The full court denied a temporary stay in <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Hedges">Hedges v. Obama</a> [JURIST news archive], which sought to temporarily block enforcement of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act of 2012</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF]. Justice Clarence Thomas <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/021913zr_2c8f.pdf">denied a stay of execution</a> [order, PDF] for <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=warren+hill">Warren Lee Hill</a> [JURIST news archive] and rejected his petition for <em>certiorari</em>. Hill has an IQ of 70 and his execution has been stayed several times due to courts disagreeing on the nature of his mental disability. Despite Thomas' denial, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stayed the execution to consider the issue <A href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/warren-hill-execution-stayed_n_2720700.html">minutes</a> [Huffington Post report] before Hill was to be executed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Monsanto</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-7-cases-including-seed-patent-dispute.php">report</a>] on the scope of a <a href = "http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Monsanto">news archive</a>] <a href = "http://www.google.com/patents/US5352605?hl=en">patent</a> [text] on genetically-modified seeds that utilizes <a href = "http://www.monsanto.com/weedmanagement/pages/roundup-ready-system.aspx">Roundup Ready</a> [product website] technology. The seeds are altered to "self replicate," which means that the more one plants the seeds, additional seeds will be produced. Monsanto sued a number of farmers who were using the self-replicating technology in harvests after the season they purchased the seeds, arguing the farmers should have to purchase new seeds every year. Attorneys for the farmers argued that the farmers were using the patent as intended.<blockquote>Patent exhaustion provides that once a patented article is sold, it passes outside the protection of the Patent Act. It is available to be used by the purchaser to practice the invention. Now, what's the invention here? The invention is a bit of DNA that, when asserted into a soy bean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow from that seed resistant to the active ingredient in Roundup. Now, the only way to practice that invention is to plant the seed and to grow more seeds.</blockquote>Monsanto argued that its patent specifically alters the soybeans in ways that using other soybeans, which the farmer can buy at a cheaper price, is protected by the patent. For example: "[T]he glyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a particular plant, it changes the way you have to control weeds. And he would not be able to use Monsanto's technology that would allow aerial application of an herbicide. He would have to&#8212;if he wanted to buy plain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to control for weeds in the conventional way."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-10362.pdf">Millbrook v. US</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-reverses-west-virginia-redistricting-ruling.php">report</a>] on if <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">28 USC &#167; 1346</a> [text] waives the immunity of prison guards who commit intentional torts, within the scope of their authority but not while committing a search, seizure or arrest. Millbrook's attorney argued that the alleged sexual assault on Millbrook occurred within the scope of the prison guards' employment, and suggested that the legislature did not mean to exclude extreme acts of misconduct.<blockquote>And even in Pennsylvania, you see cases where people do outrageous things, like a private detective shooting a picketing protester, where the Pennsylvania courts have held that that's within the scope of employment. It's a complicated issue. It's an issue of State law and it will be different in every State, which is why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to be handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this Court on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law. But I think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania courts would find this within the scope of employment.</blockquote>The attorney for the United States argued that a plain reading of the law suggests the waiver is for anything within the scope of the employment, which is defined by State law, regardless of the improper acts committed through that scope: "[T]hose torts [listed] serve as a rough approximation of what Congress anticipated would be the areas where it thought the United States should be liable, when we are talking about Federal law enforcement officers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-sixth-fourth-amendment-cases.php">report</a>] that police cannot a detain a suspect a mile away from the premises in the search warrant. The court found that <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=837525223284584585&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Michigan v. Summers</a> [opinion] does not apply to this situation, where Chunon Bailey was detained a mile away from his residence. Justice Anthony Kennedy delivered the opinion, stating that three law enforcement interests considered in <span class = "casename">Summers</span>&#8212;officer safety, facilitating the completion of the search, and preventing flight&#8212;are not as important in situations such as Bailey's.<blockquote>[N]one applies with the same or similar force to the detention of recent occupants beyond the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched. Any of the individual interests is also insufficient, on its own, to justify an expansion of the rule in <span class = "casename">Summers</span> to permit the detention of a former occupant, wherever he may be found away from the scene of the search. This would give officers too much discretion. The categorical authority to detain incident to the execution of a search warrant must be limited to the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched.</blockquote>The court did not address if the arrest would have been constitutional under a <span class = "casename">Terry</span> stop, and left the issue for remand.

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, concurred in the decision but disagreed with the majority's use of interest balancing. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Breyer's dissent argued that the incident was almost indistinguishable from <span class = "casename">Summers</span> and the court had invited confusion by not explaining what "in the vicinity of the premises" means. "A bright line will sometimes help police more easily administer Fourth Amendment rules, while also helping to ensure that the police do not go beyond the bounds of the reasonable. The majority, however, offers no easily administered bright line. It describes its line as one drawn at 'the immediate vicinity of the premises to be searched,' to be determined by 'a number of factors ... including [but not limited to] the lawful limits of the premises, whether the occupant was within the line of sight of his dwelling, the ease of reentry from the occupant's location, and other relevant factors.' The majority's line invites case-by-case litigation although, divorced as it is from interests that directly motivate the Fourth Amendment, it offers no clear case-by-case guidance."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill is intended to increase protections for Native American and Alaskan Native women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender victims, and immigrant victims and their children. The legislation also give tribal courts on reservations more power to pursue cases against non-indigenous individuals who attack indigenous women on tribal land. Last year the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate both passed renewal bills, but they were <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/senate-renews-violence-women-act-article-1.1262231">unable to reach a compromise</a> [AP report] over the prosecutorial power of tribal courts. UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/rapporteur/docs/RashidaManjoo.doc">Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile, DOC] emphasized the importance of the legislation:<blockquote>Since its enactment in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has played a crucial role in providing guidance to state and local level governments, and in facilitating their adequate responses to violence against women. It has steadily expanded funding to address domestic violence and, with each reauthorization, it has included historically underserved groups.</blockquote>The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.php">voted 78-22</a> [JURIST report] last week to renew the Act.

<p>In 2011 a UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.26.Add.5_AEV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by Manjoo said that there is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">continued prevalence of violence</a> [JURIST report] and discriminatory treatment of women in the US, with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. The report said the US has taken some positive steps with the passage of the VAWA and the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ079.108.pdf">Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003</a> (PREA) [text, PDF], but concluded that a lack of substantive protective legislation at both the federal and state levels combined with the poor implementation of current laws was resulting in the continued prevalence of violence against women and a discrimination against victims, particularly affecting women in the military, women in detention, Native American women and other women in poor and/or immigrant communities. The report further said that rates of abuse against women are higher among the African American, Native American and immigrant communities. Last year JURIST Senior Editor Brandon Gatto argued that the VAWA should be reauthorized to better <a href="/dateline/2012/04/brandon-gatto-vawa.php">protect immigrant partners and spouses from abuse</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that Austria's existing ban on the practice, also called successive adoption, violated Articles 8 and 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The treatment of same-sex couples was discriminatory, the court said, when compared with unmarried, heterosexual couples in which one partner wished to adopt the child of the other partner. The court also concluded that the Austrian government failed to show that excluding successive adoptions by same-sex couples, while allowing unmarried, heterosexual couples to engage in the practice, was necessary for the protection of the "traditional family" or for the protection of the interests of the child. Following the ruling, <a  href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged the Austrian government to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/austria-reform-needed-after-european-court-adoption-victory-lesbian-couple-2013-02-19">reform its laws</a> [press release] to reflect the court's decision.

<p>Controversy surrounds efforts to expand the adoption rights of same-sex couples. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.bverfg.de/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court of Germany</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/ls20130219_1bvl000111.html">ruled</a> [judgment, in German] that same-sex couples in a civil union can <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">legally adopt</a> [JURIST report] the non-biological children of their partners. In October the <a href="http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/northern-ireland-high-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that a law permitting adoption only by heterosexual married couples or single individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, is unlawful. That same month the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/civil.cfm">Alabama Court of Civil Appeals</a> [official website] ruled that an Alabama law defining marriage as between one man and one woman <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alabama-court-rules-woman-cannot-adopt-same-sex-partners-child.php">bars a woman from adopting her female partner's child</a> [JURIST report]. Just last March the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the right of a person in a same-sex partnership to adopt his or her partner's child is not protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, the draft prohibits using platforms for speakers or the use of tents during sit-ins and bars carrying banners or chanting slogans found to be defamatory or insulting to religious or state institutions. The draft law imposes criminal sanctions on organizers who fail to comply with these legal requirements. The Egyptian government argues that the intent of the legislation is to prevent peaceful and violent protests from mixing. In recommending that the draft law be revised to conform with international treaties, Colville commented that: "No one should be criminalized or subjected to any threats or acts of violence, harassment or persecution for addressing human rights issues through peaceful protests."

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the beginning of the revolution. The Egyptian <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] announced Monday that it had <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">rejected parts of the draft election law</a> [JURIST report] that will govern the country's upcoming parliamentary elections. Earlier this month the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the legislative constitutional assembly that recently drafted a new charter was legitimate. The judges claimed a crowd of Islamists outside the courthouse of had intimidated the judges and blocked the entrance to the courthouse. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] in late January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protests throughout the country. Earlier in January Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in cities a day after nationwide unrest compounded following an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/19/sri-lanka-un-rights-council-should-launch-inquiry">press release</a> [official statement] announcing the letter, HRW claims that despite assurances by Sri Lanka that they are diligently investigating claims of rights abuses during the 26-year civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder], there has been little evidence to confirm that claim. HRW would like the UNHRC to consider launching its own investigation into rights abuses and efforts made by the nation to address them when the rights organization meets next month. According to the the author of the letter, Asia Director at HRW, Brad Adams:<blockquote>Over the past year the Sri Lankan government has alternated between threatening activists who seek justice and making small, cynical gestures to keep the international community at bay. The Human Rights Council should dismiss these tactics, end the delays and authorize an independent, international investigation into the estimated 40,000 civilian deaths at the conflict's end.</blockquote>HRW claims that the state of human rights in Sri Lanka have deteriorated since the last time the UNHRC met in March 2012 and that democracy itself is in danger without international intervention.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. Earlier this month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka's failure to investigate abuses adequately. Last July HRW urged Sri Lanka to stop <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2011 the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In April 2011 a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010 Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The current law <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-usa-abortion-alabama-idUSBRE91J05E20130220">permits abortion clinics to partner with doctors</a> [Reuters report] who have hospital admitting privileges for provision of follow-up care. Supporters of the Women's Health and Safety Act say the act is intended to require that abortion clinics meet the same health standards as hospitals, thus better securing safety for women who choose to undergo an abortion. Critics of the act claim the measure will effectively close many abortion clinics in Alabama. The bill will now move to the Alabama <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Senate</a> [official website] for additional consideration and approval.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are a controversial topic, with numerous states changing their abortion laws recently, resulting in several legal challenges. In Arkansas earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-house-approves-ban-on-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved a ban</a> on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and a week prior the Arkansas Senate passed a ban on abortions when a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">fetal heartbeat is detected</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-massachusetts-abortion-clinic-buffer-zone.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Massachusetts law that established "<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ma/buffer-zone-law-info-for-patients-18525.htm">buffer zones</a>" [Planned Parenthood backgrounder], creating a protected area outside of the abortion clinic where people are not allowed to protest. Also in January, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-orders-trial-for-kansas-abortion-law-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a challenge to a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/hb2075/">2011 Kansas law</a> [HB 2075 materials] prohibiting insurance companies from covering abortions will go to trial.

US District Judge Carl Barbier <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-bp-spill-barrels-idUSBRE91J06120130220">determined</a> [Reuters report] those 810,000 barrels qualified as "collected," as they were funneled through the "blow-out preventer" and collected immediately by BP without coming "into contact with any ambient sea water." The decision could reduce the potential penalty that BP will pay by as much as $3.5 billion based on CWA guidelines which impose a maximum fine of $4,300 per barrel if it is determined that BP's behavior was "gross negligence." BP <a href="http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&contentId=7085040">welcomed</a> [statement] the ruling and suggested they would remain vigilant in its efforts to fight any penalties they feel are excessive.

<p>Tuesday's ruling was the most recent development in a long series of legal battles that have arisen from the Deepwater Horizon spill. Earlier this month the owner of the drilling rig which caused the spill, <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Deepwater Inc.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the CWA and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] BP to share partial liability with Transocean in oil spill claims in January 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Roberts reasoned that although the state court would be forced to answer a question of patent law to resolve Minton's legal malpractice claim, the "answer will have no broader effects" because "[i]t will not stand as binding precedent for any future patent claim" nor "even affect the validity of Minton's patent." Finding that there was "no serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum," the court concluded that federal law does not deprive the state courts of subject matter jurisdiction in hearing the claim.

<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1118.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript; <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_1118">audio</a>] in the case last month. The suit arose out of computer programmer Vernon Minton's claim of patent infringement against the <a href="http://www.finra.org/">National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.</a> and <a href="www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.</a> [corporate websites] in 2000, where he was represented by attorney Jerry Gunn. There, Minton's case was dismissed on summary judgment by the <a href="www.txed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> [official website] on grounds that Minton's patent was invalid under the "on sale bar" of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102">35 USC &#167; 102</a> [text]. On appeal for reconsideration, Minton unsuccessfully argued for the first time that his patent fell within the "experimental use" exception of the federal law. On further appeal, the <a href="www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/336/336.F3d.1373.02-1560.html">affirmed</a> [opinion], ruling that the "experimental use" argument was waived because it was not raised initially in the district court. Minton subsequently sued Gunn for legal malpractice in Texas state court, but was similarly defeated on summary judgment. On appeal, Minton argued for the first time that the state court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear his claim against Gunn, and he should therefore be allowed to begin anew in federal court. Although the <a href="http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/">Supreme Court of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/desktop/public/document/Minton_v_Gunn_355_SW3d_634_Tex_2011_Court_Opinion">agreed with Gunn</a> [opinion], the US Supreme Court's ruling on Wednesday effectively reverses that judgment and remands for further proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Michigan</a> [SCOTUblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-double-jeopardy-clause.php">report</a>] that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/double_jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] applies even if the trial judge acquitted the defendant based upon an erroneous ruling on the required elements of the offense. The defendant was charged with arson for burning down a vacant house in violation of a Michigan <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(agjxbkqq3ohhnqynh2gxhyau))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-750-73">statute</a> [MCL 750.73 text]. The trial court added an additional element to the state law requiring the prosecution to prove that the burned house was a dwelling. Failing to prove the nonexistent element, the trial court granted defendant's motion for a directed verdict and entered an order of acquittal, dismissing the case. The <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] reversed the lower court's decision, reasoning that this case does not involve giving the prosecution a second opportunity to present evidence that it could have in the first proceeding. The US Supreme Court reversed the Supreme Court of Michigan. The US Supreme Court had <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=154946">previously ruled</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that double jeopardy applies when the trial judge makes an erroneous evidentiary finding regarding a required element of a crime. The state of Michigan tried to distinguish the precedent, where the trial court erroneously required the prosecution to prove more with regard to an element, with the current situation, where the trial court added an additional erroneous element. However, the US Supreme Court stated that both cases involved "an antecedent legal error that led to an acquittal because the State failed to prove a fact it was not actually required to prove" and that there was no distinguishable difference between the precedent and the current case.

<p>Justice Samuel Alito, the lone dissenting opinion, argued that the court's decision does not serve the original purpose of the double jeopardy clause. Alito stated that the original purpose of the double jeopardy clause was to prevent the state, with its superior resources and power, from getting multiple attempts to convict an individual for the same crime. Alito argued that in this situation the state never received a fair opportunity to prosecute the defendant in the first place. Alito further argued that there was no actual acquittal because acquittals are decisions based on resolution of elements of the charged offense, whereas in this case the decision was based on element that was not part of the charged offense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that its holding in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-rules-lawyer-must-inform.php">Padilla v. Kentucky</a> [JURIST report] does not apply retroactively. In <span class="casename">Padilla</span>, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-651.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that immigration attorneys are required to inform their clients about some of the deportation consequences of guilty pleas under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentvi">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] of the Constitution. In Justice Elena Kagan's opinion in <span class="casename">Chaidez</span>, the court found that this did not apply to cases that were already final on appeal. This means immigrants who wish to appeal their cases to retract guilty pleas may not argue ineffective counsel if their case became final before <span class="casename">Padilla</span> was decided in 2010. This is because the question was previously unaddressed or even entirely different in many jurisdictions. Kagan wrote, "When we decided Padilla, we answered a question about the Sixth Amendment's reach that we had left open, in a way that altered the law of most jurisdictions." Supporters of the decision argue this avoids an overflow of appeals of immigration rulings. 

<p>The petitioner in <span class="casename">Chaidez</span> was indicted in 2003 on three counts of mail fraud and pleaded guilty on the advice of counsel. The government initiated removal proceedings in 2009, and Chaidez appealed, claiming she would not have pleaded guilty if she had been aware that such a plea could result in deportation. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case last April.

Quintana stated that he was particularly troubled by the escalation of military offensives in Kachin State where thousands have become displaced since fighting began in June 2011 between rebels and government troops: "The ongoing large military presence, which remains beyond the reach of accountability mechanisms, means that serious human rights violations are continuing there." Quintana also noted that in Rakhine State "both Muslim and Buddhist Rakhine communities continue to suffer the consequences of violence that the Government has finally been able to control, though question marks remain over the extent to which excessive force has been used." The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern for the approximately 120,000 people in internally displaced camps, paying particular regard to the lack of adequate health care in the larger Muslim camps and calling for the safe passage of humanitarian assistance to such camps. Currently some local and international medical staff are unable to provide care to some of the Muslim camps due to the threats and harassment they face from local Rakhine Buddhist communities. Quintana urged local authorities to send a clear message through their networks that such harassment of medical staff is not acceptable.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] reported last month that more than 2,000 people have <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-voices-concern-over-myanmar-refugee-crisis.php">fled the growing violence</a> [JURIST report] in the northern Myanmar state of Rakhine and Bangladesh, leaving aboard boats operated by smugglers in the Bay of Bengal. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end to the sectarian violence in Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, calling on the government to do more to end the violence and protect the rights of the Rohingya, whose civil rights were effectively taken away with their citizenship in 1982. In August <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] reported that Myanmar's army <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">is still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontnigeria.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Nigerian federal government this week was ordered to pay nearly US$240 million to the community of Odi, which was raided by the military in 1999. Justice Lambo Akanbi of the <a href="http://www.fhc-ng.com/root.htm">Federal High Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/02/20/Nigeria-to-pay-240-million-for-massacre/UPI-57391361371941/">ruled against the government</a> [UPI report], describing the army's invasion as genocidal and as a violation of the residents' human rights. In November 1999 former Nigerian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2645805.stm">Olusegun Obasanjo</a> [BBC profile] ordered the invasion that left hundreds dead in the 15,000-resident town after a group in the community had kidnapped six police officers. The judge dismissed claims about the troops' mission made earlier by counsel to current Nigerian President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12192152">Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile], stating that the president recently acknowledged publicly that the victims were not militants, but innocent members of the community. The government was represented in the trial by Nigeria's attorney general Nkolika Awa, who stated afterward that he was not overly concerned with the verdict, probably because it implicates not the government but that of ex-president Obasanjo, who has been an outspoken critic of President Jonathan. The government has 21 days to comply with the court's order.

<p>Nigerian citizens are still confronted with threats of violence over a decade after the military raid of Odi.

Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin," has publicly claimed responsibility for several attacks, including <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4Vpsk9pJxwfvsGVSauUtxhi9puw?docId=CNG.08bf367b8562759d55ef1851220362a0.01">church bombings</a> [AFP report] on December 25 that killed approximately 40 people in 2011.

Williams</a> [JURIST report] that in Tara Williams' case, the California Court of Appeal properly adjudicated her federal <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] claim on its merits and should have been deferred to under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of (AEDPA) [<a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254">28 USC &#167; 2254(d)</a> text]. The Court held that this deference is proper, and although the California Court of Appeal did not explicitly deal with Williams' federal claim that her right to an impartial jury trial was violated, it did in a matter that satisfied the AEDPA. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the Court, which found the case was controlled by last term's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-rules-on-effective-assistance-of-counsel-standard.php">Harrington v. Richter</a> [JURIST report].<blockquote>Although <span class = "casename">Richter</span> itself concerned a state-court order that did not address  any of the defendant's claims, we see no reason why the <span class = "casename">Richter</span> presumption should not also apply when a state-court opinion addresses some but not all of a plaintiff's claims.  There would be a reason for drawing a distinction between these two situations if opinions issued by state appellate courts always separately addressed every single claim that is mentioned in a defendant's papers. If there were such a uniform practice, then federal <em>habeas</em> courts could assume that any unaddressed federal claim was simply overlooked.</blockquote>The Court found that for an adequate <em>habeas</em> claim the defendant must prove the state court "inadvertently overlooked" a federal claim. Alito suggested that it was "exceedingly unlikely" that the California Court of Appeal had overlooked Williams' claim, and relied partially on Williams treating her federal and state claims as interchangeable. "Williams presumably knows her case better than anyone else, and the fact that she does not appear to have thought that there was an oversight makes such a mistake most improbable."

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the judgment but not the reasoning, suggesting the Court does not need to engage in analysis over whether a lower court "overlooked" a claim a plaintiff raised. "Only after conducting its own detective work does the Court conclude that the federal claim was not overlooked in this case. This complex exercise is unnecessary. A judgment that denies relief necessarily denies&#8212;and thus adjudicates&#8212;all the claims a petitioner has raised."</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [JURIST report] that an error is "plain" within the meaning of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_52">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b)</a> [text] so long as the error was plain at the time of appellate review, even if that error is based on legal opinions announced since the original incident of error. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the majority opinion.<blockquote>Imagine three virtually identical defendants, each from a different circuit, each sentenced in January to identical long prison terms, and each given those long sentences for the same reason, namely to obtain rehabilitative treatment. Imagine that none of them raises an objection. In June, the Supreme Court holds this form of sentencing unlawful. And, in December, each of the three different circuits considers the claim that the trial judge's January imposed prison term constituted a legal error. Imagine further that in the first circuit the law in January made the trial court's decision clearly lawful as of the time when the judge made it; in the second circuit, the law in January made the trial court's decision clearly unlawful as of the time when the judge made it; and in the third circuit, the law in January was unsettled.

<p>To apply Rule 52(b)'s words "plain error" as of the time of appellate review would treat all three defendants alike. It would permit all three to go on to argue to the appellate court that the trial court error affected their "substantial rights" and "seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings." To interpret "plain error" differently, however, would treat these three virtually identical defendants differently, allowing only the first two defendants, but not the third defendant, potentially to qualify for Rule 52(b) relief.</blockquote>Before this holding, the First, Second, Sixth, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits applied Rule 52(b) as being at the time of appeal, while the Ninth Circuit applied the law at the time of trial.</p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented from the holding. "Since a plain-error doctrine of this sort cannot possibly induce counsel to make contemporaneous objection, it seemingly has no purpose whatever  except  to create the above described anomaly. No, that is not quite true. It does serve the purpose of enabling today's opinion to say that the plain-error rule has been 'preserved,' and has not been entirely converted to a simple-error rule.  Of course a simple-error rule&#8212;all trial-court mistakes affecting substantial rights can be corrected on appeal&#8212;would better serve the Court's mistaken understanding that the only purpose of Rule 52(b) is <em>fairness</em> combined with its erroneous perception that all defendants who fail to make a timely objection to misapplication of the law stand in the same boat. But a simple-error rule would be contrary to the clear text of Rule 52(b), which tempers Rule 51(b) with 'fairness' only when the error is plain. The Court must find some application for the plainness requirement, even if it be one that is utterly pointless. It has done so."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-17.pdf">McBurney v. Young</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-7-cases-including-seed-patent-dispute.php">report</a>] the Court considered, under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privileges_and_immunities_clause">Privileges and Immunities Clause</a> [text] of Article IV of the US Constitution, if a state can bar an out-of-state resident from accessing public records normally obtainable by a state resident. The court will also analyze this question under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">dormant commerce clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In this case, Mark McBurney attempted to utilize Virginia's <a href = "http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.2-3700">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text], although he is not a Virginia state resident. The act prevents non-state residents from accessing certain state records. McBurney argued that this provision is discriminatory, largely against out-of-state businesses who seek records within Virginia. "[T]he modern transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of well-established common law rights to access that are based not on modern notions of transparency but on the right to secure property and other basic interests." The Solicitor General for Virginia argued that it was a cost-saving measure for the state to limit the number of requests, and that as the state is not discriminating against anyone, it is free to administrate the database as it pleases. Chief Justice Roberts at several junctures pointed out that he did not understand where the conflict was for either party, and that Virginia restricting the records seemed pointless. Later Justice Scalia commented, "[I]s it the law that&#8212;that the State of Virginia cannot do anything that's pointless? Only the Federal Government can do stuff that's pointless?"

<p>The Court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-43.pdf">PPL Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-4-new-cases.php">report</a>] on how to analyze foreign taxes. PPL Corporation is attempting to qualify for a foreign tax credit for paying a "windfall tax" in the United Kingdom, where they own a 25 percent stake in a utilities company. It's attorney, Paul Clement, argued for a traditional, formalistic approach to evaluate the windfall tax, which the he argued imposed double taxation on PPL as the windfall tax was evaluated as a tax on "value" rather than a tax on profits, although it determined value solely by surveying profits.<blockquote>But again, that is classic excess profits tax. So let me try to come at it this way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had a tax that said, we are going to tax your value and we are going to measure your value based on the income you made in the last year or the last 2 years.<br />
Now, I would say that that is clearly a creditable income tax. If they said the same thing&#8212;we are going to tax your value and we are going to calculate your value based on your income over the last 2 years, but we are going to subtract 10 percent of your market cap&#8212;that would be an excess profits tax.<br />
The market cap would be different for every company, so there would be another thing that was different for each company, and the effective rate might be different but that's okay because that's how an excessive profits tax works.</blockquote>The Solicitor General argued against this understanding. "The windfall tax is not an income tax. It is a tax on an increment of company value. A company's profits multiplied by a price to earnings ratio is a typical way of imputing a value on a company. Using profits as one variable in that valuation formula does not transform a tax on company value into an income tax."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new election law embodies the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">key changes to five articles</a> [JURIST report] as demanded by Egypt's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] earlier this week. The Shura Council adopted the court's ruling and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/21/us-egypt-vote-idUSBRE91K0PT20130221">approved the changes without a vote</a> [Reuters report]. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] is expected to schedule the parliamentary elections to be held within the next two months. Notable changes to the law include officers not being allowed to change their political party once they are elected, one third of the lower house being reserved for independents and members of the former National Democratic Party (NDP) being barred from participating in politics for ten years. Morsi is expected to ratify the election law and announce the date for elections this month.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the beginning of its revolution. Earlier this month the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the legislative constitutional assembly that recently drafted a new charter was legitimate. The judges claimed a crowd of protestors outside the courthouse had intimidated the judges and blocked the entrance.

The court <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/605211-11th-circuit.html">granted the stay</a> [opinion, PDF] to allow time to consider the implications of the court now finding that Hill, 53, is in fact intellectually challenged with an IQ of 70. Specifically, the court asked for the parties to address if Hill could have presented this fact before and if this finding would have caused no reasonable jury could have found him guilty and whether Hill's claim for protection has already been addressed in another proceeding. In addition to the Eleventh Circuit's ruling, a <a href="http://www.gaappeals.us/">Court of Appeals of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/20/georgia-supreme-court-warren-hill-stay-execution">granted</a> [Guardian report] a concurrent stay of Hill's execution. The state court granted the stay to consider an appeal by Hill regarding the recent change by the Georgia Department of Corrections to its lethal injection protocol, the traditional three-drug "cocktail" having been replaced with a single dose of the sedative pentobarbital.

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit granted the say hours after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-campaign-finance-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] his petition for <em>certiorari</em>. Hill's appeal to the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/georgia-supreme-court-rejects-death-row-inmates-appeal.php">denied</a> early this month. In July the Supreme Court of Georgia unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-supreme-court-halts-warren-hill-execution.php">granted a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] 90 minutes before Hill was scheduled to be executed, in order to consider the state's new single-dose lethal injection protocol. In a separate order the court also denied Hill's request to hear his appeal of a Butts County Superior Court ruling, which held that Hill had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-court-declines-to-halt-execution-of-mentally-disabled-death-row-inmate.php">failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</a> [JURIST report] that he is mentally disabled, and that the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard itself is constitutional. The US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"><em>Atkins v.

Brought by the <a href="http://www.pontiac.mi.us/boards/board_retirement.html">City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System</a> in the <a href="www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official websites], the lawsuit <a href="http://www.rgrdlaw.com/media/cases/66_complaint.pdf">contended</a> [complaint, PDF] that Lockheed and several named executives overstated financial prospects and projections for its information technology division in 2009. In particular, the public employees' pension fund alleged that Lockheed and its individual employees used devices and schemes to defraud investors, made untrue and misleading statements, and engaged in what should otherwise be considered fraud and deceit under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-lockheed-settlement-idUSBRE91J0YA20130220">settlement</a> [Reuters report] now awaits approval in the district court.

<p>Lockheed has faced limited legal scrutiny within the last ten years.

At least 1,000 protesters <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2013/02/21/3120191/palestinian-demonstrations-continue-in-support-of-hunger-strikers">were marching</a> [<em>JTA</em> report] to Ofer Prison in support of four Palestinian inmates on a hunger strike. As Israeli forces obstructed the march protesters threw stones and burning tires, at which point the Israeli forces utilized rubber-coated bullets and tear gas to break up the crowd. At least 29 Palestinian protesters were injured in the incident. The recent clash is only one of many incidents in the last few days. There was a <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/palestinian-prisoners-announce-solidarity-strike">similar incident</a> [AP report] on Tuesday in which Israeli soldiers used the same measures against protesters. The four inmates have been under administrative detention, which is renewable and permits detention for up to four months without charges. They have been protesting against such detention through hunger strikes. Among them are Tarek Qa'adan and Jafar Azzidine who have been on hunger strike for 78 days and Samer Al-Issawi who has been on partial hunger strike for 200 days. A Jerusalem court on Tuesday rejected Al-Issawi's request to be released on bail.

<p>Israel's administrative detention and the resulting hunger strikes have been criticized by the international community. Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody are in poor health. She also noted that "[p]ersons detained must be charged and face trial with judicial guarantees in accordance with international standards, or be promptly released." In June UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-chief-calls-on-israel-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release two Palestinian detainees</a> [JURIST report] who have been on hunger strike for 82 and 58 days to protest their administrative detention. Earlier in that month <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/israel-urged-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] of conscience and administrative detainees or immediately try them under international fair trial standards. In May UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-should-try-or-release-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-un.php">try or release more than 1,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who had been on hunger strike. Earlier that same month the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-supreme-court-declines-to-free-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] against two detainees who had been on hunger strike in their appeal seeking release from detention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Writing for Cairo's High Administrative Court, Judge Maher Abu el-Enin <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-egypt-police-beards-idUSBRE91J0U620130220">rejected a request</a> [Reuters report] from the <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] to permit it to suspend police officers who violated the unwritten rule established by the country's former ruler. During his reign and up through the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder], Mubarak used police and other government officials to punish Islamist groups he considered to be enemies of the state, and also prevented bearded Egyptians from holding senior positions in government. Because the Prophet Mohammad was known to have a beard, facial hair is considered to be both a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20877090">cultural and political symbol</a> [BBC op-ed] throughout much of the Arab world.

<p>The United States has recently dealt with its own legal issues regarding facial hair. In April 2011, a judge in Virginia ruled that the <a href="http://www.vadoc.state.va.us/">Virginia Department of Corrections</a> (VDOC) [official website] did not violate the rights of a Muslim inmate when corrections officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-denies-challenge-to-virginia-prison-grooming-policy.php">barred him from growing a beard</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Unpublished/067548.U.pdf">previously upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] VDOC's grooming policy prohibiting the growing of beards and stressed that "due deference" should be given to the judgments of prison officials. In March 2011, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/doj-sues-california-prison-system-for-punishing-sikh-inmate-because-of-refusal-to-trim-beard.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> [official website] for ordering a Sikh inmate to trim his beard in violation of his religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EC found that Greece failed to comply with a 2005 <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d5aaa3fb923e5a42bbb2cfe4510614d8d3.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Oah0Se0?text=&docid=60243&pageIndex=0&doclang=FR&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=155070">ruling</a> [opinion, in French] that required the country to take steps to either close down or rehabilitate hundreds of illegal landfills within its borders. According to reports submitted to the EC, around 78 illegal landfills are still in operation in violation of the EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:182:0001:0019:EN:PDF">waste legislation</a> [99/31/EC, PDF]. With that reference the EC suggested that, after the second ruling, a daily penalty payment of &#8364;71,193 should be implemented, such a penalty possibly being reduced every time an illegal landfill is closed and rehabilitated until Greece is in full compliance with the judgment. Regarding Sweden, the EC found that the country has failed to comply with a 2012 order to license two major industrial installations, one for a steel factory and the other for an ore mine. Under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pollutants/stationary/ippc/index.htm">IPPC directive</a> [materials], industrial and agricultural activities that have high pollution risks are required to be licensed. The EC suggested that Sweden should be imposed a daily penalty payment of &#8364;14,912 after the second ruling until the country complies with the existing order.

<p>Environment issues have been viewed to be closely interconnected with human rights issues. Earlier this week UN Independent Expert on human rights and the environment <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/IEEnvironment/Pages/JohnKnox.aspx">John Knox</a> [official profile] stated that international governments must acknowledge and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-urges-recognition-of-interdependency-of-environmental-and-human-rights.php">account for human rights when formulating environmental regulations</a> [JURIST report]. In January more than 140 nations gathered at a UN forum <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/nations-reach-agreement-on-treaty-addressing-mercury-use.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a legally binding treaty addressing the use of mercury, a metal that is infamous for its detrimental effects on health and the environment. In June the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] and UNEP issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/human-rights-environmental-laws-necessary-for-sustainable-development-un-report.php">joint report</a> [JURIST report] highlighting the need for the implementation of integrative human rights and environmental protection laws and policies to achieve sustainable development. The report stated that the "protection of the environment and the promotion of human rights are increasingly seen as intertwined" and that individuals from poor countries are more vulnerable to diseases and other basic need insecurities as a direct result of the ecosystem.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The businesses, both owned by the Christian Green family, are claiming that enforcement of the PPACA requires the corporation to sacrifice its religious freedoms by being forced to give money to employees health plans which provide for emergency contraception which the companies view as an abortive procedure. The brief filed by the legislators claim that enforcement of the PPACA is contrary to the <a href="http://ows.doleta.gov/dmstree/uipl/uipl94/uipl_2894a.pdf">Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993</a> [text, PDF] and that people and corporations religious freedoms should trump provisions of the healthcare law which question those beliefs. 

<p>Tuesday's amicus brief is the most recent development in the challenge of the Green family in its fight against the PPACA. Last December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] said it <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">would not intervene</a> [JURIST report] in issuing an injunction while an appeal was still pending with the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], the Greens have said they <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/two-businesses-will-not-comply-with-supreme-courts-order-on-contraception-mandate.php">will not comply</a> [JURIST report] with the mandate even without a protective injunction. Justice Sonya Sotomayor ruled that the Oklahoma City family's religiously oriented business did not meet the requirements to allow an injunction against the PPACA's mandate. The opinion stated that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending. The organizations are appealing an order by the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma that <a href = "http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Order-for-HL-PI.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that despite the family's religious values, the businesses do not qualify for an injunction. "However, Hobby Lobby and Mardel are not religious organizations. Plaintiffs have not cited, and the court has not found, any case concluding that secular, for-profit corporations such as Hobby Lobby and Mardel have a constitutional right to the free exercise of religion."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Franzo Grande Stevens, a former attorney for Fiat, and Gianluigi Gabetti, the former Agnelli family holding company executive, were each given <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/21/exor-trial-idUSI6N0B101N20130221">suspended sentences</a> [Reuters report], meaning that neither of them will actually spend time in jail.

The NCAA lawsuit seeks to stop the Commonwealth from keeping for its own uses the $60 million in fines levied against <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Pennsylvania State University</a> (PSU) [official website] as a result of the recent child sexual abuse scandal at the university. Pennsylvania enacted the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&sessYr=2013&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0187&pn=0133">Institution of Higher Education Consent Decree Endowment Act</a> [text] in order to keep the funds.

The NCAA seeks to enjoin enforcement of the act on the grounds that it attempts to "legislate where private parties spend their money, and to confiscate funds intended for victims of child sexual abuse nationwide to be used solely for the benefit of Pennsylvania residents, at the direction of Pennsylvania officials." The NCAA imposed <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/July/21207232">sanctions</a> [text] on PSU in July following the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/jerry_sandusky/index.html">Jerry Sandusky</a> [NY Times profile] child abuse scandal.

<p>The filing of the NCAA lawsuit is merely the latest in the ongoing dispute between Corbett and the NCAA over the sanctions imposed on PSU. Last month Corbett filed a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/ncaafootball/governor-announces-lawsuit-against-ncaa-over-penn-state-penalties.html">lawsuit</a> [NY Times report] against the NCAA in federal court on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania for the "overreaching and unlawful" sanctions imposed on PSU.

Yemeni security forces <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21532019">fired on protesters</a> [BBC report] on Thursday despite AI's plea. The protest marches were organized by the Southern Movement to mark the one-year anniversary of the uncontested election of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and to push for a nonviolent succession from the nation. According to AI Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Ann Harrison: <blockquote>The Southern Movement and its followers have a right to protest peacefully, and the Yemeni authorities must allow them this right ... That means that security forces deployed to police these demonstrations must refrain from using excessive, lethal force against peaceful protesters, something they have failed to do in the recent past.</blockquote> AI has not yet responded to the violence which took place during the protest.

<p>Yemen has received criticism from the international community and human rights groups for its flawed investigations of deaths that occurred during the nations yearlong pro-democracy protests. In June 2011 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] to send a panel to investigate the human rights situation in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/YEIndex.aspx">Yemen</a> [OHCHR backgrounder]. Amid fervent protests in April 2011, former president Ali Abdullah Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down from power</a> [JURIST report], ending his 32-year reign as the nation's leader, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Earlier that month AI released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">urging the international community</a> [JURIST report] to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate the deaths of protesters. Earlier in 2011 <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L. Ali Khan</a>, Professor of Law at Washburn University wrote that the people's revolutions of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt are in <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">response to sham democracies</a> [JURIST op-ed] and their peoples' desire to enforce their rights and liberties. Also that year <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11787855&amp;Itemid=326/">Dr. Jonathan Schanzer</a>, Vice President of Research at the <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php">Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a> [advocacy website] noted that for all his problems, Saleh had <a href="/hotline/2011/03/the-middle-east-protest-movements-each-with-a-story-all-with-uncertainty.php">kept Yemen stable</a> [JURIST op-ed] by placating its influential tribal patriarchs and paying them patronage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The rights group has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/mexico0213webwcover.pdf">documented at least 250 "disappearances"</a> [report, PDF] since 2007. In most of these cases, security forces failed to search for the victim or investigate, and perpetrators have not been prosecuted. HRW predicts that many more individuals disappeared during the administration of former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12242685">Felipe Calderon</a> [BBC profile]. Jos&#233; Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at HRW, urged the current administration to take action:<blockquote>President Pe&#241;a Nieto has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of Latin America. While his administration has announced some important measures to assist victims, it has yet to take the steps necessary to ensure that those responsible for these horrific crimes are brought to justice.</blockquote>HRW recommends, among other measures, that the federal government investigate and prosecute members of the Army, Navy and Federal Police alleged to have participated in the forced disappearances. HRW also urged the government to establish databases of disappeared individuals and unidentified remains found in mass graves in order to identify missing individuals.

<p>This is not the first time the security forces have been accused of committing rights abuses, most of which have been committed in response to the crackdown on illegal drugs. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandiego.edu/peacestudies/tbi/">Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego</a> (TBI) [official website] in July reported that that Mexican military forces have been <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/report-urges-mexico-authorities-to-investigate-human-rights-violations.php">committing human rights violations with impunity</a> [JURIST report]. HRW reported in November 2011 that Mexican security forces had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mexico-security-forces-committing-rights-abuses-hrw.php">committed widespread rights abuses</a> [JURIST report], such as torture and forced disappearances, in combating organized crime. In August 2011, Mexico's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, in Spanish] issued a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/fuentes/documentos/Recomendaciones/Generales/019.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] contending that military and law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mexico-human-rights-body-alleges-regular-police-misconduct.php">routinely conducted illegal searches</a> [JURIST report]. Mexico has struggled to combat the drug cartels' influence on the government and the country as a whole.

The House of Representatives previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-house-approves-ban-on-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a version that only allowed exemptions where the mother's life was threatened. <a href="http://andymayberry.com/">Representative Andy Mayberry</a> (R) [personal website], who first proposed the bill, conceded to the amendments under pressure from the Democratic minority in the Senate. <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Mike Beebe</a> (D) [official website] has said <a href="http://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/90970/arkansas-legislature-passes-20-week-abortion-ban">he has constitutional concerns</a> [AP report] about the bill, but has not confirmed whether he will veto the legislation.

<p>Though Beebe has yet to comment on his plans regarding this bill, he has said that he would veto an earlier <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">bill</a> [SB 134, PDF] banning all abortions after the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">detection of a fetal heartbeat</a> [JURIST report].

The ruling upholds the decision of the <a href="http://humanrights.gov.au/">Australian Human Rights Commission</a> (AHRC) [official website] to terminate the complaint of sex discrimination under the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda1984209/">Sex Discrimination Act of 1984</a> [text] on the grounds that it was "misconceived and/or lacking in substance." Justice Jayne Jagot of the <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] held that there was no gender discrimination in this policy, because men and women were both equally denied the right to marry a person of the same sex:<blockquote>The inescapable fact is that s 5 [of the Sex Discrimination Act] defines sex discrimination in a manner which depends on a comparison between the treatment of the person of one sex with the treatment of a person of the opposite sex. In the present case, the alleged discriminatory treatment results from the fact that the relevant agencies of the State can register a "marriage" which is defined by s 5(1) of the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma196185/">Marriage Act 1961</a> [text], ... as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. It follows that the union of a man and a man or a woman and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life, is not a "marriage" as defined in the Marriage Act and cannot be registered by the State agencies as a marriage. In the terms of s 5 there cannot be discrimination by reason of the sex of a person because in all cases the treatment of the person of the opposite sex is the same. Hence, a man cannot enter into the state of marriage as defined with another man just as a woman cannot enter into the state of marriage with another woman as defined. ... The redress for these circumstances lies in the political and not the legal arena because what would be required is a change to the definition of "marriage" in s 5(1) of the Marriage Act.</blockquote>Legislation aimed at allowing same-sex marriage was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/australian-senate-rejects-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by the Australian Parliament in September, despite <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/new-poll-backs-samesex-marriage-20120213-1t1h4.html">polls</a> [SMH report] showing that most Australians support same-sex marriage.  

<p>Same-sex marriage remains a controversial issue around the world. Earlier this month lawmakers in both <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/france-lawmakers-approve-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">UK</a> [JURIST reports] approved bills that would legalize same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is currently recognized in nine US states and the District of Columbia, and lawmakers in <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Illinois</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST report] have recently given approval to same-sex marriage legislation. In December Uruguay's lower house of parliament approved a same-sex marriage bill that would make <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/uruguay-lower-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Uruguay</a> only the second Latin American country to allow same-sex marriage, following <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Argentina</a> [JURIST reports]. Same-sex marriage has been legal in <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mexico-city-legislature-approves-same.php">Mexico City</a> since 2009, and last year the Supreme Court of Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/mexico-high-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-ban-in-oaxaca.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Oaxaca's same-sex marriage ban, which could pave the way for legalization across the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Government soldiers have allegedly participated in torture, summary executions and enforced disappearances that began after the French-led offensive in January helped Malian forces retake most of the north. HRW alleges that witnesses recently informed them that the government has tortured two men, summarily executed two more, and forcibly disappeared at least six others since earlier this month when the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-urges-mali-to-investigate-summary-executions.php">group reported</a> [JURIST report] the summary executions of at least 13 men and enforced disappearance of five. Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at HRW, said:<blockquote>All officials need to act in accordance with human rights law if security and law and order are to be restored to areas recently recovered by the government. This means providing basic due process rights for anyone taken into custody, and making sure they are treated humanely. Commanders who fail to stop abuses by their troops can themselves be prosecuted.</blockquote>In an effort to prevent further abuses, HRW urged Mali's international partners to increase accountability efforts and made recommendations to the Malian government on ways to address military abuses and provide civilian protection. 

<p>The Malian government allegedly denies knowledge of these acts of violence targeting particular ethnic groups amidst scrutiny from international sources.

In an order Tuesday that remains classified, Army <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/04/28/2773674/911-judge-has-handled-tough-cases.html">Col. James Pohl</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=james+pohl">news archive</a>] allowed lawyers for the five detainees to spend 12 hours during one visit to Camp 7. The lawyers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/judge-says-lawyers-for-accused-911-plotters-can-see-inside-top-secret-guantanamo-camp/2013/02/21/58e28e12-7c46-11e2-9073-e9dda4ac6a66_story.html">requested</a> [AP report] 48 hours with the detainees inside the camp and to be allowed multiple visits. Although Pohl only allowed the lawyers limited access to Camp 7, James Connell, a lawyer for detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ali+abdul+aziz+ali">Ali Abdul Aziz Ali</a> [JURIST news archive] said that Pohl's decision is a positive step, as it <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/guantanamo-lawyers-visit-top-secret-cells-judge-says-201349514.html">helps lawyers gather more information</a> [Reuters report] about their clients.

<p>The procedures and policies regarding the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] military commission hearings have faced significant scrutiny. Last week lawyers for the US Navy <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-lawyers-say-surveillance-devices-did-not-breach-detainee-attorney-client-privileges.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that surveillance equipment deployed throughout the Guantanamo Bay detention center was not used to breach attorney-client privilege. Earlier this month a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-stop-to-911-hearing-censoring.php">ordered the removal</a> [JURIST report] of any monitoring system that censors the public broadcast of the hearings. In September, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on the ability of lawyers representing detainees who have had their <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges denied or dismissed to access their clients. In February 2012 the chief US military tribunal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/chief-guantanamo-judge-protects-confidentiality-of-attorney-client-mail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the content of attorney-client mail inspected at the Guantanamo Bay prison is confidential and may not be released.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Counsel for the accused <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&task=download&id=2160_aa9ee2884264d88e1462f929f8ba3a26">requested the delay</a> [motion, PDF] in January citing pre-trial issues including alleged incomplete disclosure by prosecutors, insufficiency of evidence and pre-trial briefs, technical and translation issues regarding disclosed material, and the continued absence of the accused. Judge Daniel Fransen agreed that the prosecution had failed to adequately disclose essential materials to the defense and reasoned that enforcing the original trial date would not allow adequate preparation time required by fundamental notions of due process. According to the STL, Fransen has <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/media/press-releases/pre-trial-judge-postpones-trial-date">requested</a> [press release] that the prosecution, defense and victims' representatives submit documents detailing trial-preparedness by March 8, whereupon a new "tentative" date will replace the original March 2013 trial date. 

<p><a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/the-cases/stl-11-01/main/accused">Salim Ayyash, Mustafa Badreddine, Hussein Oneissi and Assad Sabra</a> [STL profiles] are charged <em>in absentia</em> with involvement in a 2005 truck bombing that killed Hariri and 20 others. In July the STL <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lebanon-tribunal-confirms-jurisdiction-over-accused-hariri-assassins.php">confirmed its jurisdiction</a> [JURIST] over the trials of the alleged assassins. Earlier that month the STL <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/case-against-hariri-assassins-to-proceed-in-absentia-lebanon-tribunal.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the decision to try the four accused <em>in absentia</em>. The tribunal rejected a defense motion challenging the legality and jurisdiction over the case. The STL could not find any error of legal reasoning in the February 2012 decision that could lead to unjust treatment of the four accused. In February 2012 the STL <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lebanon-tribunal-to-try-accused-hariri-assassins-in-absentia.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution's office permission to proceed with the case against the four accused assassins. The court reasoned that the prosecution and the national authorities have undertaken all reasonable steps to apprehend and inform the accused. In August 2011 the STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-to-investigate-bomb-attacks-related-to-hariri-case.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would investigate three additional bombings that is believed to be connected to the February 2005 bomb attack. Two days earlier, the UN-backed tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-unseals-indictment-in-hariri-case.php">unsealed</a> [JURIST report] the indictment against the accused assassins after a pre-trial judge confirmed the indictment and ordered the lift of confidentiality. In June 2011 the STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-files-4-indictments-in-hariri-assasination-investigation.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the indictment along with an arrest warrant against the accused to local authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The sisters were convicted for work done on Melvin's 2003 and 2009 Supreme Court campaigns. Melvin was found guilty on six of seven counts of theft of services, criminal conspiracy and misappropriation of state property. A third sister, former state senator Jane Orie, was also convicted last year and is currently serving two-and-a-half to 10 years in prison. Melvin has been suspended without pay, leaving the high court with three Republican and three Democratic justices until her absence is filled. <a href="http://www.pabar.org/">Pennsylvania Bar Association</a> (PBA) [website] president Thomas Wilkinson <a href="http://www.pabar.org/public/news%20releases/pr022113.asp">commented on the verdict</a> [press release]:<blockquote>As lawyers, we have a responsibility to do all we possibly can to help preserve the integrity of the justice system and restore public confidence in our judiciary. The many distinguished and honorable judges in Pennsylvania deserve nothing less. An independent and impartial judiciary is a cornerstone of our system of justice, and public confidence in the judiciary is undermined when judges engage in high profile misconduct, such as by directing their law clerks and staff to perform political campaign work when they should be doing the important business of the court.</blockquote>Melvin <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/state/orie-melvin-faces-removal-from-state-supreme-court-676423/">faces disciplinary proceedings</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] from the Judicial Conduct Board, possible disbarment by the state Disciplinary Board and potential impeachment proceedings by the state legislature.

<p>Judicial corruption is a threat worldwide. Last month retired Michigan Supreme Court justice Diane Hathaway <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-michigan-supreme-court-justice-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.php">pleaded guilty to felony bank fraud</a> [JURIST report]. The charges arose from Hathaway deeding her home in Florida to a relative while negotiating a short sale on the home, resulting in a $600,000 debt they owed to their bank being erased. In October the UN called on nations around the world to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">combat judicial corruption</a> [JURIST report], stating that it is a human rights issue because it can deprive people of their due process rights. It also said keeping the judiciary free from corruption is critical to "strengthen judicial credibility and independence."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The summons follows a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/haiti-court-orders-former-president-duvalier-to-appear-at-human-rights-hearing.php">previous order</a> [JURIST report] from nearly two weeks ago by a Haitian appeals court for Duvalier to appear for the hearings, a directive which the ex-president <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hQPdv7MbwQeMTvJSvSiHzGnFCHlw?docId=dcc235527b064426ac4d1d1166ea3913">failed to follow</a> [AP report]. Duvalier returned to Haiti in 2011 after 25 years in exile, prompting an investigation for crimes committed from 1971-1986. Last January a magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">dismissed human rights charges against Duvalier</a> [JURIST report], including allegations of rape, torture and murder, on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. Twenty victims of Duvalier's reign initiated the charges and appealed the case after it was dismissed. Judge Joseph Lebrun dismissed an appeal by defense counsel to have the case heard by the Supreme Court, stating that it is imperative that Duvalier appear before the court next week. 

<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/about/programs/open-society-justice-initiative">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy websites] urged Haiti to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/rights-groups-urge-haiti-to-pursue-case-against-jean-claude-duvalier.php">ensure that Duvalier is brought to justice</a> [JURIST report]. Last February the <a href="http://www.state.gov">US State Department</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-state-department-sends-experts-to-haiti-to-strengthen-haitian-courts.php">dispatched</a> [JURIST report] a team of international law experts to Haiti to assess how the country could reinforce the power and independence of its judiciary. That same month, UN Independent Experty Micael Forst said that Haiti is <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/haiti-rule-of-law-has-made-significant-progress-un-expert.php">making significant progress</a> [JURIST report] with the respect to the rule of law, citing improvements such as the establishment of judicial offices and the adoption of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36c0.html">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] for the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Perry-Respondents-Merits-Brief.pdf">respondent couples</a>, as well as for the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Perry-San-Franciscos-Brief.pdf">City and County of San Fransisco</a> [briefs, PDF]. The advocates urged the court to find California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, claiming that the law served only to "stigmatize gay men and lesbians." The ban, known as  <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+8">news archive</a>], was a voter-approved state measure to limit the meaning of marriage to include only a man and a woman. In 2012, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], as it "stripped same-sex couples of...an important right." The Supreme Court is to review this ruling on March 26 to determine the constitutionality of Proposition 8, and to examine whether the law may legally be defended in future federal courts. In addition to this case, the court is also scheduled to hear a challenge to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] next month. 

<p>The issue of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is an ongoing controversy in the US. Last month the Supreme Court received briefs in two separate cases <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">defending the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of both Proposition 8 and Section 3 of DOMA. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in both cases in December. In early December, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In the same time frame, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit corporation in Nevada which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court </a>[JURIST report] to grant <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires Nevada to change its definition of marriage from the union of a man and a woman to the union of two persons. In November, the office of the Maryland Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">released an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that same-sex couples can obtain marriage licenses, allowing Maryland to become the ninth US state to allow same sex marriage after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> [JURIST reports] enacted similar measures in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report said the recent crimes occurred in prisons, police stations, detention centers and at public demonstrations, resulting in a death toll of 53 Palestinian civilians. The report expressed disappointment that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] has not announced plans to investigate the officers and ministry staff. The rights groups also said that they believe the president should be held responsible for the abuses:<blockquote>We believe that the President is subject to personal criminal responsibility for these crimes in accordance with the principle of chain of command in light of his position as head of the Supreme Council for the police. Proceeding from this responsibility it is imperative to take immediate action to stop these crimes and to hold those responsible for their commission.</blockquote>The rights groups created a 10-point initiative to combat the crimes. The plan includes requests the dismissal of the Interior Minister, withdrawal of the demonstration draft law and amendments to the Penal Code and Police Act.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last week the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. The draft law requires that organizers inform authorities about protest plans in advance and allows the interior ministry the right to reject demonstrations. In late January the UN High Commission for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming form ongoing protest throughout the country.

Germany uses a mixed-member proportional representation voting system which has voters cast two ballots, one for a constituent and one for a party. When a party wins more constituent votes than party votes, they receive "overhang" seats. The new law will grant "compensation seats" to smaller parties to retain proportionality. The new law will result in a larger and more balanced parliament. The next federal elections are scheduled for September. 

<p>The new legislation was drafted after Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-constitutional-court-rules-national-election-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down the previous election law</a> [JURIST report] in July for violating the constitutional guarantee of direct, free and equal elections.

The case was brought by a woman who wanted to adopt the child of her partner of 20 years. In a 5-4 judgment, the court upheld the constitutionality of a law making it legally impossible for a person to adopt a child if the potential adopter is of the same sex as the child's legal parent. In its ruling, the majority stated that households with a mother and a father were most beneficial to the child. In his dissent Chief Justice <a href="http://http://www.ramajudicial.pr/sistema/supremo/biodenton.htm">Federico Hernandez Denton</a> [official profile, in Spanish] said that the court's ruling <a href="http://http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/puerto-rico-supreme-court-upholds-law-that-bars-gays-from-adopting-children/2013/02/20/32bdbf3e-7b8f-11e2-9c27-fdd594ea6286_story.html">discriminated</a> [AP Report] against same-sex couples and was not in the best interest of the child in this case. 

<p>Recently, adoption rights of same-sex couples have created controversy in several courts worldwide. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled that a woman in a same-sex relationship could <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/europe-rights-court-rules-austrian-woman-can-adopt-child-of-same-sex-partner.php">adopt her partner's biological child</a> [JURIST report]. The court ruled the ban violated Articles 8 and 14 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].  Also this week the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that same-sex couples in a civil union <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">can legally adopt</a> [JURIST report] the non-biological children of their partners. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/northern-ireland-high-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in October that a law permitting adoption only by heterosexual married couples or single individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, is unlawful. Also in October, the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/civil.cfm">Alabama Court of Civil Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alabama-court-rules-woman-cannot-adopt-same-sex-partners-child.php">upheld a law limiting marriage</a> as a union between and one man and one woman. That ruling effectively barred a woman from adopting her female partner's child.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Obama Administration filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/US-merits-brief-Windsor-2-22-12.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] arguing that DOMA violates the constitutional guarantees to equal protection of the laws, which applies to the federal government pursuant to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. Respondent <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-thea-edie-doma">Edith Windsor</a> [ACLU backgrounder], who is challenging the law's constitutionality, also filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Windsor-brief-on-juris.-2-22-131.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] arguing that the Executive Branch's agreement that DOMA should be found unconstitutional does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction to decide the issue. Republican leaders from the <a href-"http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website], who are defending the law's constitutionality, filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BLAG-brief-on-juris.-2-22-13.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] supporting Windor's assertion of jurisdiction, and adding that the House has standing to defend a statute against constitutional challenge when the Executive Branch refuses to do so. The Court is set to hear oral arguments in this case in March.

<p>Windsor is a widow who had a legal same-sex marriage under Canada and New York law, but was denied spousal deduction for federal estate taxes when her wife died. Prior to her challenge, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend DOMA in courts</a> and, in response, members of the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">formed</a> [JURIST reports] the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) to defend the law. In July,132 members of the House who support the law's constitutionality filed an <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/07/us-house-members-file-court-brief-arguing-doma-unconstitutional.php"><em>amicus</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] in another case arguing that statutory classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened judicial scrutiny and that DOMA should be overturned as unconstitutional under any level of judicial scrutiny. The brief was filed in the appeal of <em>Karen Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management</em>, the landmark case in which the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-finds-defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional.php">DOMA is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In June, 10 US senators filed their own <em>amicus</em> brief in the case, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-senators-file-brief-supporting-defense-of-marriage-act.php">arguing in the opposite</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government had a legitimate interest in creating a uniform federal definition of marriage to "[avoid] massive legal uncertainty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Meece, the head of <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/monusco/">United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (MONUSCO) [official website], said that new threats have materialized in new areas, including the Maniema and Katanga provinces, and there is "a very limited opportunity to respond to them." He also emphasized the importance of the pending initiative to add an unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance capability to MONUSCO and thanked the council for its support of that proposal. Meece reported that the imminent formal adoption of the multi-year joint justice program between the DRC <a href="http://www.justice.gov.cd/">Ministry of Justice and Human Rights</a> [official website, in French] and the UN would effectively complement MONUSCO's ongoing efforts with the military justice system in the fight against impunity. 

<p>The UN has been increasingly concerned about the abuses by both <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">M23 rebels</a> [JURIST news archives] and Congolese troops against civilians over the past several months. In December, a UN probe <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-probe-rights-violations-during-recent-violence-in-eastern-drc.php">found</a> [JUIRIST report] that at least 126 people were raped and two civilians were killed during violence in the region last November. A month earlier, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned M23</a> [JURIST report] for guerrilla attacks on the DRC and called for an end to all support of the group. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/drc-rebels-committing-war-crimes-hrw.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] in September alleging that M23 had been responsible for numerous war crimes, including summary executions, rape and forced recruitments. In June, a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">leaked UN report</a> [JURIST report] revealed that Rwanda had been helping to create and support M23 and similar rebel groups that have been known to violate human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Uruguay's legislature passed the law in 2011, allowing the government to investigate human rights violations that occurred during the <a href="http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/22.htm">12-year dictatorship</a> [Library of Congress backgrounder] and not subjecting these violations to a statute of limitations. The court <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130222/uruguays-supreme-court-rules-against-dictatorship-trials">struck down</a> [Reuters report] the law because it found that two of the articles were unconstitutional, effectively restoring the nation's 1986 <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15848&Anchor=">Expiry Law</a> [text, in Spanish], which granted amnesty to military officials accused of human rights violations during the dictatorship era. The Expiry Law places in doubt 20 murder cases that have been brought against Uruguay's former dictator, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Juan+Maria+Bordaberry">Juan Maria Bordaberry</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Laws concerning Uruguay's dictatorship era have been the subject of judicial controversy in recent years. In 2011, the <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=666614&CFTOKEN=69520161">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish] condemned the Uruguayan government for its role in the abduction and death of an Argentinean woman in the 1970s, effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/human-rights-court-invalidates-uruguay-military-amnesty-law.php">overturning the country's amnesty law</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010, the Uruguayan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uruguay-high-court-annuls-dictatorship-amnesty.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that amnesty granted for crimes committed by the country's 12-year dictatorship was unconstitutional. Months earlier, Bordaberry was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uruguay-ex-president-sentenced-to-30.php">sentenced to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the country's 1973 military coup. Bordaberry was arrested in 2006 on charges of murder and was later charged with violating Uruguay's <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Uruguay/uruguay.html">constitution</a> [materials, in Spanish]. The Uruguay Supreme Court also addressed the Expiry Law in a 2009 ruling, finding it <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-high-court-overturns-amnesty.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] as it applied to the case of Nibia Sabalsagaray, who was allegedly murdered by the military in 1974. The court concluded that the law <a href="http://www.elpais.com.uy/091020/pnacio-449148/nacional/caducidad-afecto-muy-seriamente-las-garantias-">violated separation of powers and constitutional sovereignty</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, Illinois <a href="http://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Lisa Madigan</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2013_01/20130108.html">petition for re-hearing en banc</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/illinois-ag-asks-seventh-circuit-to-reconsider-concealed-carry-ban.php">report</a>], which requests for all 10 judges on the court to hear the case. On Friday, the court <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2013/02/22/4484010/court-wont-reconsider-ill-concealed.html">rejected Madigan's rehearing petition</a> [AP report] by a 5-4 vote, with one judge not participating. Judge David Hamilton dissented, saying that the December decision went too far in striking down restrictions on guns. In his dissent, he stated <blockquote>The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether the...individual right to bear arms at home under the Second Amendment extends beyond the home. The panel's split decision in these cases goes farther than the Supreme Court has gone and is the first decision by a federal court of appeals striking down legislation restricting the carrying of arms in public.</blockquote> Madigan has 90 days to decide whether or not to appeal to the  <a href="http://supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>Illinois lawmakers, particularly those in Chicago, have struggled to limit firearm possession and advance <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] initiatives in the city without violating the Constitution. In June the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-chicago-gun-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of the <a href="http://www.isp.state.il.us/docs/ordinances/chicago.pdf">Chicago Firearms Ordinance</a> [text, PDF] that prevents firearm purchase by individuals who have "been convicted by a court in any jurisdiction of ... unlawful use of a weapon that is a firearm" because such a standard is unconstitutionally vague. The ordinance was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Chicago City Council in July 2010, and imposes strict regulations on firearm possession. In particular, residents who possess firearms are required to keep them inside their homes, and are not permitted to take their guns into the yard, garage or porch of the home. The legislation was enacted four days after the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is applicable to the states as well as the federal government. The decision effectively struck down Chicago's former handgun ban, as it prohibited citizens from keeping handguns in their homes under any circumstances. </p>]]></content:encoded>

It ruled that the state's <a href="http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=iowacode&ga=83&input=144C">Final Disposition Act</a> [text] gives the spouse of a decedent "the right to control the final disposition...with no accompanying requirement that he follow her instructions." The court said the only exception to the spouse's right to control a decedent's disposition is if there is a "declaration designating somebody else." In this case, the decedent specified in her will that she wished to be buried in Montana, but her husband wanted her to be buried in Iowa. The decedent's sister, the executor of the estate, originally obtained an order from the probate court to bury her in Montana pursuant to her will, but the supreme court's decision will reverse that order.

<p>In the past, much of the legal controversy surrounding wills and estates has dealt with inheritance laws, most recently in the context of same-sex couples' inheritance rights. Last week, three <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/three-briefs-filed-with-supreme-court-in-case-challenging-doma.php">briefs were filed</a> [JURIST report] in a case pending review by the US Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text]. The case stems from Edith Windsor, who was legally married to her wife under Canada and New York law, being denied a spousal deduction for federal estate taxes when her wife died. In August, a Minnesota court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-court-rules-that-same-sex-couples-have-inheritance-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's <a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/bin/getpub.php?pubtype=STAT_CHAP&year=2007&section=517#stat.517.03.0">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text] did not prevent same-sex couples from inheriting from each other. </p>]]></content:encoded>

It urged UAE to not only grant immediate access to lawyers, but also to either charge or release 13 Egyptian detainees who are accused of having ties to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egyptian+muslim+brotherhood">Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archives]. Some of the detainees, which include doctors, engineers and professors, have been held since November, and no charges have been filed against them yet. HRW also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/22/iran-guarantee-rights-terror-suspects-0">urged Iran</a> [press release] to allow 20 detainees who are being held on charges related to the killing of Iranian nuclear scientists access to lawyers and family members. HRW also stated that Iran has not provided "basic information" about the charges to the detainees or their families, despite the possibility of severe penalties which could include death. In both cases, HRW expressed doubt as to whether the governments have credible evidence to sustain charges against the detainees, stating that if they did they would not be denying them basic rights and information about why they are being held.

<p>Denying detainees accused of terrorism and other serious crimes basic human rights while they are detained is a controversial issue internationally. Earlier this month, HRW urged Afghanistan to make meaningful <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-to-afghanistan-end-torture-in-government-detention-facilities.php">reforms to end torture</a> [JURIST report] in government detention centers. This came weeks after the UN released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-report-details-abuse-torture-of-afghanistan-detainees.php">report detailing abuses</a> [JURIST report] occurring in Afghanistan prisons. In November, the US Department of Justice announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/doj-may-appeal-ruling-on-guantanamo-prisoner-access-to-counsel.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] a court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that rejected its argument that the government could set special rules regarding <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainees' access to counsel.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkansas.jpg" alt="Kansas Seal" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/kansas-courts/supreme-court/default.asp">Kansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and-Opinions/opinions/SupCt/2013/20130222/103487.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a non-biological mother of children conceived using assisted reproductive technologies has parentage rights under Kansas law. Kelly Goudschaal and Marci Frazier were in a committed, long-term, same-sex relationship and had two children via artificial insemination. The couple executed a co-parenting agreement and after they separated, Frazier filed suit to enforce the agreement. The district court found jurisdiction under the <a href="http://www.kansasjudicialcouncil.org/Documents/Legislation/2010%20Legislation/Domestic%20Code_Final_.pdf">Kansas Parentage Act</a> (KPA) [PDF] to consider Frazier's claim and awarded the couple joint legal custody. Goudschaal appealled, asserting that she was the only person with a constitutionally protected status of parent and that Frazier was an unrelated third party. The Supreme Court held that a woman can make a claim to being a presumptive mother of a child without claiming to be the biological or adoptive mother, and, therefore, jurisdiction was properly granted. Additionally, the court found the co-parenting agreement was appropriate: <blockquote>Looking at the coparenting agreement ... the children were third party beneficiaries of that contract. They would have a reliance interest in maintaining the inherent benefits of having two parents, and severing an attachment relationship formed under that contract would not only risk emotional and psychological harm ... but also void the benefits to the children that prompted the agreement in the first instance. So what Goudschaal really wants is to renege on the coparenting agreement without regard to the rights of or harm to the children, all in the name of constitutionally protected parental rights. Surely, her constitutional rights do not stretch that far.</blockquote> However, the court stated that it discerned an absence of sufficient evidence to determine what the best rights of the children were and remanded the case to determine that.

<p>Same-sex child custody and support issues have been the subject of many state court decisions recently. On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.ramajudicial.pr/sistema/supremo/index.htm">Puerto Rico's Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/puerto-rico-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law banning same-sex couples from adopting children. In June, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-in-north-carolina-to-allow-same-sex-adoption.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging North Carolina's law against second-parent adoptions, which effectively bans individuals in same-sex couples from adopting their partner's child. Earlier that month the New Mexico Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/new-mexico-high-court-rules-same-sex-partner-can-seek-custody-of-adopted-child.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the same-sex partner of a parent who has adopted a child has a right to seek custody of that child after the partnership has dissolved. In February the Massachusetts Appeals Court ruled that same-sex couples who marry and <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/massachusetts-court-rules-child-custody-laws-apply-to-same-sex-parents.php">have a child through artificial insemination</a> [JURIST report] are subject to the same child custody laws as heterosexual couples. In May 2009 a New York state appeals court ruled that child support claims <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-york-court-rules-family-court-lacks.php">cannot be brought against same-sex partners</a> [JURIST report] who have no biological or legal ties to a child. In 2005, the California Supreme Court ruled that estranged same-sex couples who created a child using reproductive science were to be <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/states-brief-ca-supreme-court-rules.php">treated the same as heterosexual parents</a> [JURIST report] under child custody and support laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU is seeking access to testimony from <a href = "/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] defendants relating to torture and other abuses, held in the custody of the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. While the protective order does not prevent the defendants from testifying about their personal experiences of illegal government conduct, the ACLU argues it unconstitutionally prevents the public from hearing that testimony. The ACLU argues the censorship order violates the public's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] right of access to criminal proceedings. The government's request for censorship stated that the defendant's statements concerning the CIA's detention and interrogation program qualified as classified sources, methods and activities of the US that can be kept from public knowledge. The government's response to the ACLU's appeal is <a href="http://www.mc.mil/CASES/USCourtofMilitaryCommissionReview.aspx">due</a> [case materials] March 6, and the ACLU's request for oral argument is deferred until after the government responds.  

<p>The procedures and policies regarding the 9/11 military commission hearings have faced significant scrutiny. On Tuesday, the judge presiding over the 9/11 military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">granted defense lawyers access</a> [JURIST report] for the first time to Camp 7, the secret facility where detainees are housed. Earlier this month, lawyers for the US Navy <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-lawyers-say-surveillance-devices-did-not-breach-detainee-attorney-client-privileges.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that surveillance equipment deployed throughout the Guantanamo Bay detention center was not used to breach attorney-client privilege. Earlier this month a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-stop-to-911-hearing-censoring.php">ordered the removal</a> [JURIST report] of any monitoring system that censors the public broadcast of the hearings. In September, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on the ability of lawyers representing detainees who have had their habeas corpus challenges denied or dismissed to access their clients. In February 2012 the chief US military tribunal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/chief-guantanamo-judge-protects-confidentiality-of-attorney-client-mail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the content of attorney-client mail inspected at the Guantanamo Bay prison is confidential and may not be released.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/billtext_15/hbt5990.pdf">Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013</a> [text, PDF] will allocate 10 billion pesos (USD $246 million) in <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/42247-reparation-law-to-right-past-wrongs">reparations for approximately 10,000 victims</a> [<em>Manila Times</em> report] eligible to claim compensation based on abuses that took place from the time Marcos instated martial law in 1972 until he was overthrown in 1986. Over the next six months eligible individuals may submit applications for reparations to the nine-member Human Rights Victims Compensation Board, appointed by the president, which will evaluate and award claims based on a point system. Aquino signed the law on the twenty-seventh anniversary of the <a href="http://www.philippine-history.org/edsa-people-power-revolution.htm">EDSA People Power Revolution</a> [<em>Philippine History</em> backgrounder], which was led by his mother, former president Corazon Aquino, and overthrew US-backed Marcos. During that period Aquino's father, the late Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. was detained for months and later assassinated in Manila, making Aquino's family eligible to receive some of the funds, but Corazon Aquino has already stated that the family will not seek monetary reparations, merely official recognition of the tragedy. The reparations will be funded by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21571051">money recovered from Swiss bank accounts</a> [BBC report] secretly maintained by Marcos during his 20 years in power and transferred to the Philippine government by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court in 1997. Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989.

<p>The <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/">Philippines House of Representatives</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov.ph/">Senate</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-legislature-ratifies-bill-granting-compensation-for-rights-abuses.php">ratified the bicameral conference committee report</a> on the reconciled version of the law in late January, a few days after the congress <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-congress-approves-bill-granting-compensation-to-human-rights-victims.php">approved the final version of the bill</a> [JURIST report] during its second reading. The Philippines has struggled in terms of addressing human rights issues from the Marcos regime to as recently as the 2009 <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">Maguindanao Massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] and the resulting political controversies. Earlier in January a 150-day <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-begins-150-day-gun-ban-to-prevent-election-violence.php">ban on guns</a> [JURIST report] was instituted to prevent election violence.

In April 2011, the men reportedly <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130225/uae-court-upholds-life-terms-10-pirates-state-media">commandeered the MV Arrilah-1</a> [AFP report] as it hauled aluminum in the Arabian Sea en route to Dubai from Australia. The pirates allegedly used small-arms and explosives to lay siege to the vessel for 30 hours until UAE special forces raided the ship and apprehended the pirates with support from the air force and the US Navy's Bahrain-based <a href="http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/">Fifth Fleet</a> [official website]. The Abu Dhabi Federal Criminal Court of First Instance charged the men with highjacking and <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-life-in-uae.php">sentenced them to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] in May. The court also ordered that all arms and ammunition used in the highjacking be confiscated and held that the pirates would be deported after serving their sentences, which equate to 25 years for each defendant. The appellate court accepted the appeal in form and <a href="http://www.wam.ae/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&cid=1290003364849&pagename=WAM%2FWAM_E_Layout">rejected it on the merits</a> [WAM report] on Monday.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">Maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] remains an issue of global concern. In December the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-rules-us-has-jurisdiction-over-somali-pirates-in-murder-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Somalia's territorial waters extend no more than 12 miles from shore, concluding that the US has jurisdiction to prosecute a band of pirates accused of murdering four Americans in 2011. In November the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-piracy-off-somalia-coast.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] piracy and acts of armed robbery against vessels off the coast of Somalia. The UN Security Council urged the international community to develop a comprehensive response to discourage these acts. In October the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">sentenced 10 Somalis</a> [JURIST report] involved in hijacking a German freighter off the coast of Somalia in 2010. Also in October, an appeals court in Kenya concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kenya-appeals-court-allows-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenyan courts have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to try international piracy suspects. Also that month <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/accused-somali-pirates-face-trial-in-paris-court-for-hostage-incident.php">six accused Somali pirates went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Paris court in connection with the 2008 hijacking of the cruise ship Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden. In July the International Chamber of Commerce International Maritime Bureau <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/international-maritime-bureau-reports-global-piracy-down-by-half-in-2012.php">reported that the number of global pirate attacks fell sharply</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The special rapporteur pointed to the power struggle between parliament, the government and the judiciary, as having a negative impact on the rule of law. Knaul further explained that the separation of powers is a central requirement for judicial independence and impartiality. The special rapporteur also pointed to the lack of female judges, the lack of education and training for members of the judiciary, and skepticism from the public as further evidence that the Maldives has not adequately secured an independent judiciary. Knaul reasoned that the challenges she pointed out are central to both the Constitution and international human rights standards. 

<p>The UN's criticism of the Maldives' judiciary is the latest of criticism aimed at the country. Last week a Maldives court issued a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/maldives-court-issues-second-arrest-warrant-for-ex-president.php">second arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a> [JURIST news archive] on charges of the illegal detention of a judge. The charges against Nasheed stemmed from his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges in January, when Nasheed was still president. In September Amnesty International (AI) revealed violent human rights violations committed in the Maldives against opposition groups and called for an immediate independent investigation into the actions of security forces. The Maldives have experienced unrest since Nasheed ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrest of the country's chief justice</a> and then <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">resigned</a> [JURIST reports] as a result of the controversy. A court in the Maldives in July <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maldives-court-refuses-to-hear-case-against-former-president.php">refused to hear a case</a> [JURIST report] about the legality of the arrest of the chief justice, saying it did not have jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The other <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/25/us-bp-trial-idUSBRE91O0KD20130225">corporations involved</a> [Reuters report] are the rig owner <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Ltd.</a> and well cement services provider <a href="http://www.halliburton.com/">Halliburton Co.</a> [corporate websites]. The parties bringing suit against BP include the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], states bordering the Gulf Coast and individuals who did not agree to an earlier settlement agreement. The trial is to be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billions-of-dollars-are-at-stake-for-bp-as-trial-opens-for-gulf-oil-spill-litigation/2013/02/25/cfadad44-7f2d-11e2-a671-0307392de8de_story_1.html">conducted in phases</a> [WP report] with the first part focusing on determining what caused the blowout of the well and assign percentage blame on the companies involved.

<p>Monday's commencement of the trial against BP and other corporations is the most recent development in a long series of legal battles that have arisen from the Deepwater Horizon Crisis. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">accepted a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between BP and the DOJ for the company's criminal liability in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Earlier in January, Transocean Ltd. <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the CWA and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. In December a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill.

<p>The ICC only has jurisdiction over member states of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] or if a situation is referred to it by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website]. Syria <a href="http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&chapter=18&lang=en">signed</a> [text] the Rome Statute in November 2000 but has yet to ratify it. More than 70,000 people have been killed in Syria, according to Pillay, and she has repeatedly urged the Security Council to refer the situation to the ICC. Pillay called for the international community to strengthen its processes for addressing human rights violations and provide the necessary support to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the opposition since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Security Council to refer the Syrian situation earlier this month. Last month more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC. A study carried out by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] reported in January that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">average number of deaths per month has increased significantly</a> [JURIST report] since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012. A UN official said in November that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Pillay called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report]. Her statement came after <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported earlier that month that the Syrian government was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">using cluster bombs</a> [JURIST report] against opposition forces. In September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">UN investigators reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number and frequency of human rights violations committed by both sides of the conflict were increasing rapidly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The message was delivered by UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/DeputyHighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] in an event organized by the <a href="http://www.icomdp.org/">International Commission against Death Penalty</a> [advocacy website]. Ban stressed that death penalty should be abolished because it is inconsistent with the most fundamental human right principle: right to life. He also expressed concern that some states which have abolished the controversial practice has resumed imposing death penalty and proceeded with executions. He reiterated that "[t]he taking of life is too absolute, too irreversible, for one human being to inflict on another, even when backed by legal process." Ban urged that the trend of abolishing capital punishment should be continued:<blockquote>Capital punishment is inconsistent with the mission of the United Nations to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person. A global moratorium is a crucial stepping stone towards full worldwide abolition.  I urge you to use this meeting to consider how to further this end.</blockquote>A moratorium on the death penalty was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">first approved </a> [JURIST report] by the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] in 2007 and, as of December 2012, has gained the support of 111 countries, with 41 against and 34 neither supporting nor opposing.

<p>The use of the death penalty has remained a controversial issue around the globe. Earlier this month, a Kashmiri militant who received the death penalty for participating in the 2001 attack on India's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/india-parliament-attack-plotter-executed-after-president-refuses-to-grant-clemency.php">was executed</a> [JURIST report] after India's president turned down his plea for clemency. Also this month, two UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-death-sentence-imposed-in-bangladesh.php">expressed concern</a> over the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-member-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST reports] imposed by the International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh (ICBT) on Abdul Kalam Azad for crimes during the 1971 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The experts argued that the trial failed to provide for guarantees of a fair trial and due process. Last month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-confirms-death-sentences-for-amateur-anti-muslim-film.php">upheld the <em>in absentia</em> death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of seven Coptic Christians and an American preacher on charges stemming from the amateur anti-Muslim film Innocence of Muslims, which sparked violent protests in the Middle East last year. Also last month, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley announced that he will file <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/maryland-governor-to-introduce-death-penalty-repeal-legislation.php">legislation to repeal</a> [JURIST report] capital punishment in the state of Maryland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case involved a Washington state resident who filed a lawsuit against Denver and Colorado's <a href="http://cdpsweb.state.co.us/">Department of Public Safety</a> [official website]. He was denied a concealed weapons permit since he was not a Colorado resident, and he claimed it violated his Second Amendment rights. A federal judge dismissed his case in 2011, and the appeals court decided that carrying concealed firearms is not protected by the Second Amendment or the Privileges and Immunities Clause, nor is the right of people to keep and bear arms infringed upon by laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. The judge reasoned:<blockquote>Given that the concealed carrying of firearms has not been recognized as a right, and the fact that concealed carry was prohibited for resident and non-resident alike for much of our history, we cannot declare this activity sufficiently basic to the livelihood of the Nation.</blockquote>A spokesperson for the Colorado Attorney General's Office <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/us/court-finds-no-right-to-conceal-a-firearm.html?_r=0">welcomed the ruling</a> [NYT report].

<p>The Second Amendment and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] remain controversial issues in the US. Also Friday the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-appeals-court-rejects-illinois-request-to-reconsider-concealed-guns-ruling.php">refused to reconsider</a> a case decided in December that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-us-court-of-1.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Illinois' ban on carrying concealed weapons. Last month New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to impose tighter restrictions on gun and ammunition sales by enacting the <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/assets/documents/GPB_1_GUNS_BILL_LBD_12007_03_3.pdf">New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013 </a>(NY SAFE) [text PDF]. Also in January <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive actions</a> [JURIST report] and called on Congress to pass stricter gun-control laws. In November, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] held that New York can <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-york-concealed-carry-law.php">continue to require</a> [JURIST report] residents who seek to carry a concealed weapon to obtain a special license. </p>]]></content:encoded>

First, the court heard <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-126.pdf">McQuiggin v. Perkins</a> [transcript, PDF] and considered if "actual innocence" is an exception to not pursuing a timely <em>habeas</em> claim under the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/antiterrorism_and_effective_death_penalty_act_of_1996_aedpa">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [text]. The attorney for Greg McQuiggin, a warden in Michigan, argued that prisoners have explicitly one year under the AEDPA to file their <em>habeas</em> claim once they find evidence that suggests their innocence. The attorney for Floyd Perkins argued that the possible miscarriage of justice overrides procedural time limits:<blockquote>First, with respect to the timing issue, the Court had applied the miscarriage-of-justice exception to abusive petitions, so there is a timing concern invoked there because you're filing a second petition when you could have raised issues earlier, and the Court has said even in that timing context, not a statute of limitations, but it certainly invokes timing concerns, that even in that instance the miscarriage of justice would still overcome the rule.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito pointed out, in response, that most incarcerated people believe they are innocent. "Well, you are asking for what is potentially a very big exception to the 1-year statute of limitations. If you took a poll of all of the prisoners in Michigan, how many of them do you think would say they are actually innocent? ... But how many would say that they are actually innocent? A lot. And a lot would be able to come up with evidence that is equal to what the petition&#8212;what the Respondent here has come up with."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-10189.pdf">Trevino v. Thaler</a> [transcript, PDF] on a defense lawyer not putting forward mitigating factors in defense of his client analyzed under last term's decision in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel-claim.php">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [JURIST report]. In particular, the court considered if a plaintiff can bring up ineffective counsel at the appellate level, although the plaintiff might not have brought it up before due to the alleged ineffective counsel. The attorney for Carlos Trevino argued that the time limits imposed on the new attorney in a <em>habeas</em> claim in Texas make the claims impracticable:<blockquote>But the bottom line in our situation in Texas is that we have a scheme. We have a set of laws and rules that channel these type of claims. ... [T]he Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about the limitations of&#8212;the number of days that you have to expand the record in a motion for new trial. 75 days, the district court loses jurisdiction, they cannot hear anything else on this case. The record in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after the date of the trial.<br />
So even with a new attorney that's appointed&#8212;first of all, that new attorney is a stranger to the case. He doesn't know anything about the case. He's not in a position to talk to the client. The client is not the best person to understand the Rules of Appellate Procedure. So he's got to wait on that trial record, first of all, to see what's there.</blockquote>The attorney for Texas argued there was no deficiency in the state's procedure. "So the way that the procedure in Texas would work, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed direct appeal lawyer, who has no conflict and is therefore free to accuse trial counsel of being ineffective, would file a motion to stay the appeal, abate it and remand it to the trial court. The showing in both States is roughly the same; it's a facially plausible claim of ineffectiveness."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the case, Vonlee Titlow was advised to reject a plea deal after acquiring a new attorney in the beginning of trial proceedings. As a result, she received a longer sentence, which the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+680+F.3d+577&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=3620455102854287930&scilh=0">found</a> [opinion] was in violation of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text].

<p>In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Kansas-v.-Cheever-No.-12-609.pdf">Kansas v. Cheever</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-609.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider whether it violates the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] right against self-incrimination if a defendant offers expert testimony to show he/she lacked a requisite mental state at the time of the crime due to drug use and the prosecution offers the court-ordered mental evaluation of the defendant to rebut the testimony.</p>

<p>The court also denied <A href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Calhoun-v-United-States-Pet.pdf">Calhoun v. United States</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-6142.htm">docket</a>], with Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer releasing a <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-6142_2co3.pdf">comment</a> [text, PDF] with respect to the denial of <em>certiorari</em>. The case concerned the constitutionality of racially-tinged remarks by the prosecution at the trial level, including the prosecutor asking Bongani Calhoun, "You've got African-Americans, you've got Hispanics, you've got a bag full of money. Does that tell you&#8212;a light bulb doesn't go off in your head and say, This is a drug deal?" Further, in his rebuttal to the defense's closing, the prosecutor argued: "Okay, you got African-American[s] and Hispanics, do you think it's a drug deal? But there's one element that's missing. The money. So what are they doing in this room with a bag full of money? What does your common sense tell you that these people are doing in a hotel room with a bag full of money, cash? None of these people are Bill Gates or computer [magnates]? None of them are real estate investors." Sotomayor wrote separately condemning the remarks:<blockquote>By suggesting that race should play a role in establishing a defendant's criminal intent, the prosecutor here tapped a deep and sorry vein of racial prejudice that has run through the history of criminal justice in our Nation. There was a time when appeals to race were not uncommon, when a prosecutor might direct a jury to "consider the fact that Mary Sue Rowe is a young white woman and that this defendant is a black man for the purpose of determining his intent at the time he entered Mrs. Rowe's home," ... or assure a jury that "I am well enough acquainted with this class of niggers to know that they have got it in for the [white] race in their heart," ... The prosecutor's comment here was surely less extreme. But it too was pernicious in its attempt to substitute racial stereotype for evidence, and racial prejudice for reason.</blockquote>Due to Calhoun not raising the issue that racial questioning affected the outcome of his trial in the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the court denied <em>certiorari</em>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The LTTE opposed the Sri Lankan government during the country's 26-year, but HRW noted that "since the government's defeat of the LTTE in May 2009, new allegations of sexual violence by members of Sri Lankan security forces against alleged LTTE members and supporters have been reported." The 141-page HRW report details <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/26/sri-lanka-rape-tamil-detainees">75 cases of rape and sexual violence</a> [HRW press release] committed by a wide range of Sri Lankan security organizations, including the military, military intelligence and the police force's criminal and terrorism investigation departments. The report describes allegations of misconduct and illustrates how men and women alike were both victims and perpetrators of the violence. HRW called for the Sri Lankan government to make "serious efforts to prevent and punish sexual violence by the police and military."

<p>The human rights violations that plagued Sri Lanka during its nearly three-decade-long civil war have reportedly continued since the war's end in 2009. Almost a year ago, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-details-claim-of-sri-lanka-detention-abuses.php">reported unlawful detentions</a> [JURIST report], torture and extrajudicial executions, often under laws designed to combat terrorism. Months earlier, AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lankan leadership of failing to investigate the issues of torture and impunity for past human rights violations in the country. Citing the <a href="http://www.humanrights.asia">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website], AI reported approximately 323 cases of torture by the Sri Lankan police force from 1998 to 2011. These reports came on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/sri-lanka-unveils-5-year-action-plan-to-protect-human-rights-in-response-to-international-pressure--.php">five-year government initiative</a> [JURIST report] known as the National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights, which took effect immediately after its adoption in October 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Mercenaries/WGMercenaries/Pages/WGMercenariesIndex.aspx">Working Group on the use of mercenaries</a> [official website], recently returned from a five-day mission to Honduras, commended certain progress in establishing national police laws and a human rights bureau, but expressed great concern over the proliferation of both legal and illegal private security companies. The experts stated that outsourcing the use of force to hundreds of private security companies seriously undermines the rule of law and any functioning national security mechanism. The ratio of private security guards to police officers in Honduras is reportedly five to one. Also during its visit, the Working Group received consistent information that many private security guards carry firearms that are prohibited and are <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44215&Cr=Honduras&Cr1=#.USzSmI4bZOc">allegedly used to commit human rights violations</a> [UN News Centre report] including killings, disappearances, forced evictions and sexual violence. The experts were particularly concerned about the alleged involvement of private security companies in land rights disputes in the Bajo Aguan region in the north of the country between landowners and peasant associations, where representatives of peasant associations have reportedly been victims of such abuses at the hands of private security. The Working Group recommended adequate training and resources for the National Police to facilitate the rule of law, as well as a strengthening of the Honduran judicial system to properly investigate and prosecute potential human rights violations.

<p>In January the <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.hn/">Honduran National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish] approved controversial <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/honduras-lawmakers-pass-police-corruption-law.php">amendments to the police law</a> [JURIST report] designed to eliminate corruption. Approval came after the congress voted to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/honduras-congress-votes-to-remove-supreme-court-justices.php">dismiss four justices</a> [JURIST report] of the country's <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gob.hn/">Supreme Court</a> [official websites, in Spanish] a week earlier, after the justices ruled that the police reform bill supported by <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/porfirio_lobo_sosa/index.html">President Porfirio Lobo</a> [NYT profile] was unconstitutional. Tension between the three branches of government in Honduras has risen recently, and Lobo has expressed concern that he may be forced out of office like his predecessor, who was removed during the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">2009 military coup</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2011 the Honduran Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/honduras-truth-commission-says-coup-was-unconstitutional.php">coup was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but stated that former president Manuel Zelaya was culpable when he ignored orders of the Supreme Court. Zelaya <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-ex-president-zelaya-signs-agreement-allowing-return-to-country.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011 allowing his return to the country after nearly two years in exile.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Marshall <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-refuses-toss-gay-calif-veterans-lawsuit-18594082">refused to dismiss</a> [AP report] the lawsuit despite the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] calling for the case to be dropped. The case arises out of a denial of medical benefits to which heterosexual married couples are entitled. Tracey and Maggie Cooper-Harris would be eligible for $150 more per month in disability benefits. The DOJ argues that the claim belongs in an administrative court because it is dealing with veteran's affairs. Marshall is expected to issue a written ruling at a later date.

<p>The Cooper-Harris lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-veteran-sues-over-denial-of-benefits-to-same-sex-spouse.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] in February of last year. A similar suit was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] in October 2011 year by a disabled Navy veteran contesting the VA's refusal to allow her same-sex partner to collect a portion of her disability benefits. The veteran, Carmen Cardona, filed the suit after her claim for veterans' spousal benefits was denied under DOMA on the basis that she was in a same-sex marriage. The outcome of these cases is uncertain after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced in February of last year that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision.

According to AI, the national army, formed by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] in response to election violence in 2010, as well as militia groups, "are carrying out extra-judicial executions, deliberate and arbitrary killings, politically motivated arrests and torture" under the guise of fighting armed attacks. The report includes detailed accounts of the alleged torture and inhumane treatment of political and ethnic prisoners, including members of Gbagbo's family. More than <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15148801">3,000 people were killed</a> [BBC report] and hundreds of thousands displaced in the 2010 political crisis in which Quattara ousted Gbagbo, who had <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/eu-adopts-sanctions-against-ivory-coast-over-non-compliance-with-election-results.php">refused to accept defeat</a> [JURIST report] in the election. In its report, AI called for an international commission of inquiry into attacks committed against ethnic groups in the western Ivory Coast and urged Ivory Coast authorities to halt human rights abuses by security forces in order to end a "cycle of abuse and impunity" in the country.  

<p>Earlier this month Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ivory-coast-ex-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">appeared before</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to determine whether the case against him, including charges of numerous crimes against humanity, will proceed to trial.

A month earlier the ICC had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">unsealed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo's wife, Simone, marking the first time that the court has brought charges against a female. That same month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report stating that Ivory Coast's military <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hrw-ivory-coast-military-committed-abuse-torture.php">committed widespread human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] in August and September. The ICC in October also denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance</a> to leave the Netherlands while he recovered from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> almost a year earlier [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, van Ham rejected his request for an injunction, noting that there is insufficient evidence that the US was involved in his torture and that there is an agreement between Dutch authorities and the US that his rights will be respected. Khan's lawyer has also filed a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/dutch-court-rejects-terror-suspects-injunction-bid-to-halt-extradition-to-united-states/2013/02/26/903b6232-8009-11e2-a671-0307392de8de_story.html">request</a> [AP report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] to block the extradition order. 

<p>Tuesday's decision by The Hague District Court affirms a decision made by the Rotterdam District Court in October 2011 approving the extradition. A <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/11/25/dutch_terrorism_suspect_fights_extradition_to_us/">federal indictment</a> [AP report] against Khan was issued by US Attorney Loretta Lynch of the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] in June 2011, shortly after he was originally extradited from Pakistan to the Netherlands. In addition to the alleged plotting of the suicide attack in Afghanistan, Khan was arrested in Pakistan for possessing "destructive material and for allegedly aiding al Qaeda between 2004 and 2010. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Windsor, the surviving spouse of a same-sex couple, initiated the legal challenge to DOMA after she was denied the spousal deduction for federal estate taxes because Section 3 of DOMA defines "marriage" under federal law as a "legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and "spouse" as a "person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife." Windsor's brief argues that DOMA violates the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution because the law fails to satisfy a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny">heightened scrutiny</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in that it "cannot be justified as substantially furthering any important governmental interest."

<p>Tuesday's brief adds to the three that were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/three-briefs-filed-with-supreme-court-in-case-challenging-doma.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last week, including one filed by the Obama administration arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional and one filed by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (DOMA) defending the law's constitutionality. After the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in 2011 that it would no longer defend DOMA's constitutionality in court, Republicans in the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] the BLAG to take up the mantle of defending the law. DOMA was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-part-of-doma--dnp.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> and the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official websites], prompting the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/12-307_Cert_Petition.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] to the US Supreme Court.

The appeals court agreed, finding the state "failed to establish a substantial special need to support its mandatory suspicionless drug testing." They went on to write:<blockquote>The question is <u>not</u> whether drug use is detrimental to the goals of the TANF program, which it might be. Instead, the only pertinent inquiry is whether there is a substantial special need for mandatory, suspicionless drug testing of TANF recipients when there is no immediate or direct threat to public safety, ... or [when] anyone else for that matter, is suspected of violating the law.  We conclude that, on this record, the answer to that question of whether there is a substantial special need for mandatory suspicionless drug testing is "no."</blockquote>The appeals court continued, "The simple fact of seeking public assistance does not deprive [an] applicant of the same constitutional protection from unreasonable searches that all other citizens enjoy."

<p>The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> and the <a href="http://www.floridajusticeinstitute.org/">Florida Justice Institute</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-for-state-welfare-applicants.php">filed the challenge</a> [JURIST report] in September 2011. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Luis Lebron, a 35-year-old Orlando resident, Navy veteran and full-time University of Central Florida student who applied for Temporary Cash Assistance to help support his four-year-old son. Lebron meets all the criteria for aid but refused to submit to the drug test on the principle that it is an infringement of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. The complaint notes that the US Supreme Court has held that suspicionless drug testing by the government is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment, the only exceptions being for substantial public safety concerns and students in the public school system. Commentators have advocated that <a href="/dateline/2012/09/frank-barile-welfare-policy.php">removing the drug-test requirement for welfare recipients</a> [JURIST op-ed] is the most appropriate course of action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-207.pdf">Maryland v. King</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] permits states to collect DNA samples from individuals charged with serious crimes, as allowed under Maryland's <a href="http://www.goccp.maryland.gov/dna/documents/legislation.pdf">DNA Collection Act</a> [text, PDF]. The Chief Deputy Attorney General of Maryland argued, "The cornerstone of our argument is that when an individual is taken into custody, an individual is arrested on a probable cause, on a probable cause arrest, that person by virtue of being in that class of individuals whose conduct has led the police to arrest him on&#8212;based on probable cause surrenders a substantial amount of liberty and privacy." The US Solicitor General also argued in favor of Maryland: "I think that it is appropriately viewed as something that the government has a compelling interest in doing once a person has been arrested, and that is, knowing who that person is, which includes knowing what the person has done. And DNA does that in a far more powerful way than fingerprints have done." The attorney for Alonzo King argued that the Court should extend <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Supreme+Court+Sampson&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=1722065942834953866&scilh=0">Samson v. California</a> and <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Supreme+Court+Knights&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=1560488013338831968&scilh=0">US v. Knights</a> [opinions, which both deal with the liberty interests of parolees, to those merely arrested of a crime.<blockquote>[T]hat it could be taken at least while he is still under the supervision of the State, because after all, both <span class = "casename">Samson</span> and <span class = "casename">Knights</span> were cases in which the individual was still under State supervision. That is to say, we're not arguing that at the point of conviction, that the resulting lessened expectation of privacy extends in perpetuity as, say, a firearm or felon disability does. But what we are arguing is that&#8212;to look at this Court's cases in  <span class = "casename">Samson</span> and <span class = "casename">Knights</span>, they both centrally depended on the proposition that it is the fact of conviction that deprives an individual of the full protections of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>In July Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/supreme-court-stays-maryland-injunction-on-state-dna-collection-law.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] blocking a ruling by the <a href="http://www.courts.state.md.us/coappeals/">Maryland Court of Appeals</a> [official website] that barred police from collecting DNA from criminal suspects without a warrant, allowing the law to remain in force pending appeal.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-62.pdf">Peugh v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF] to determine whether a court violated the US Constitution's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">Ex Post Facto Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] when it applied the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2011_Guidelines/index.cfm">US Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials] at the time of the sentencing rather than at the time of the offense. The attorney for Marvin Peugh argued for retroactive application of the guidelines, so Peugh would be sentenced under the 1998 range of 37 to 46 months for his crime, rather than the 2009 range of 70 to 87 months.<blockquote>Retroactive application of harsher guidelines passed after the offense violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it&#8212;if it creates a significant risk of increased punishment. Now, the Government here objects that a guidelines amendment does not change the law, but that is incorrect. The guidelines are legislative rules that define a term of a mandatory statute, mainly subsection (a)(4) of section ... 18 USC 3553. That provision requires the district court to consider the guidelines sentencing range, and I'll quote, "established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of offender." So in 1998, the guide&#8212;that statute, the law mandated that the district court shall consider, as applied to Peugh's offense and offender category a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months.</blockquote>The Solicitor General argued that under <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Miller+v.+Florida&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=4932975680107030323&scilh=0">Miller v. Florida</a> [opinion] that an Ex Post Facto Law has to change "the legal consequences of a prior act" and as the US Sentencing Guidelines were merely amended and updated over time, it does not change the legal consequences of the crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lind <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/26/us-usa-wikileaks-manning-idUSBRE91P0QL20130226">indicated</a> [Reuters report] that Manning had been arraigned within the legal parameters, and the time between his arraignment and trial was reasonable and necessary to enable pre-trial procedures such as psychological examinations for Manning, security clearance for attorneys and evidence, and the organization of all of the classified information in the case. When the motion was submitted, Manning had been in custody for 845 days, and has currently served over 1,000 days in military detention. Manning is being held in a solitary confinement unit.

<p>Manning's case has engendered a great deal of controversy. In Janurary Lind ruled that the prosecution most prove that Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/wikileaks-judge-prosecutors-must-prove-defendant-knew-he-was-aiding-enemy.php">knew he was aiding the enemy</a> and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports]. In November the judge overseeing the case <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> a partial guilty plea <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case-offers-guilty-plea.php">offered by Manning</a> [JURIST reports] earlier in the month. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave argued that the <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">lack of transparency</a> [JURIST comment] in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June Lind ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">withheld from the defense during discovery</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in June Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss eight of the 22 charges against Manning after his defense had argued they were unconstitutionally vague. In May UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez accused the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-the-un-special-rapporteur.php">cruel and inhuman treatment</a> [JURIST report] of Manning. The US military court referred Manning's <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-refers-intelligence-analyst%27s-wikileaks-case-for-court-martial.php">case for court-martial</a> in February 2012 after a US Army panel of experts declared Manning <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST reports] last April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

General Revenue Corp.</a> [JURIST report] that <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_54 ">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)</a> allows fees to be awarded in <a href="http://business.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/CRE27-FDCPA.pdf">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [PDF; 15 USC &#167; 1692k(a)(3) <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692k">text</a>] even if the suit was brought in good faith. Petitioner Olivea Marx had a student loan debt through <a href = "http://www.edfund.org/">EdFund</a>, which hired <a href = "https://www.generalrevenue.com/">General Revenue Corp.</a> [official websites] to collect her debt. GRC subjected Marx to harassing phone calls, threats of wage garnishment and removing funds directly from her bank account, and contacting Marx's employer to assess her employment status. Marx filed suit against them and lost and was ordered to pay GRC $4,543.03 in fees. The Supreme Court held that the fee did not violate the FDCPA. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion:<blockquote>The argument of Marx and the United States depends critically on whether &#167;1692k(a)(3)'s allowance of costs creates a negative implication that costs are unavailable in any other circumstances. The force of any negative implication, however, depends on context. We have long held that the <em>expressio unius</em> canon does not apply "unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it," and that the canon can be overcome by "contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion." In this case, context persuades us that Congress did not intend &#167;1692k(a)(3) to foreclose courts from awarding costs under Rule 54(d)(1).</blockquote>The Court affirmed the <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+668+F.3d+1174+&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=4837108763974448183&scilh=0">decision</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

<p>Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented from the opinion. "Accordingly, to displace Rule 54(d)(1), a federal statute need only address costs in a way different from, but not necessarily inconsistent with, the default. The reason is straightforward. If Congress has enacted a provision with respect to costs in a statute, there is no longer any need for the default, so it gives way. This design of the Rule is sensible, because many statutes contain specific costs provisions. ... While purporting to interpret the 'ordinary meaning' of Rule 54(d)(1) the majority immediately abandons the ordinary meaning. The majority concludes that a statute provides otherwise for purposes of Rule 54(d)(1) only if it is 'contrary' to the default."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Amnesty International</a> [JURIST report] that a coalition of attorneys, journalists and rights organizations do not have <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art3frag17_user.html">Article III</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] standing to contest Section 702 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sec_50_00001881---a000-.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [50 USC &#167; 1881(a) text]. The coalition was represented by the <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and argued that FISA jeopardizes their ability to keep confidential communications with clients suspected of terrorist activities. Justice Samuel Alito, who delivered the opinion of the court, wrote that this was not sufficient to create standing:<blockquote>But respondents' theory of <em>future</em> injury is too speculative to satisfy the well-established requirement that threatened injury must be "certainly impending." And even if respondents could demonstrate that the threatened injury is certainly impending, they still would not be able to establish that this injury is fairly traceable to &#167;1881a. As an alternative argument, respondents contend that they are suffering <em>present</em> injury because the risk of &#167;1881a-authorized surveillance already has forced them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect the confidentiality of their international communications. But respondents cannot manufacture standing by choosing to make expenditures based on hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.</blockquote>The ACLU <A href = "http://www.aclu.org/national-security/supreme-court-dismisses-aclus-challenge-nsa-warrantless-wiretapping-law">denounced</a> [press release] the court's decision, stating, "It's a disturbing decision. The FISA Amendments Act is a sweeping surveillance statute with far-reaching implications for Americans' privacy. This ruling insulates the statute from meaningful judicial review and leaves Americans' privacy rights to the mercy of the political branches."

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer authored a dissent and was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan:<blockquote>The upshot is that (1) similarity of content, (2) strong motives, (3) prior behavior, and (4) capacity all point to a very strong likelihood that the Government will intercept at least some of the plaintiffs' communications, including some that the 2008 amendment, &#167;1881a, but not the pre-2008 Act, authorizes the Government to intercept. At the same time, nothing suggests the presence of some special factor here that might support a contrary conclusion. The Government does not deny that it has both the motive and the capacity to listen to communications of the kind described by plaintiffs. Nor does it describe any system for avoiding the interception of an electronic communication that happens to include a party who is an American lawyer, journalist, or human rights worker. One can, of course, always imagine some special circumstance that negates a virtual likelihood, no matter how strong. But the same is true about most, if not all, ordinary inferences about future events. Perhaps, despite pouring rain, the streets will remain dry (due to the presence of a special chemical). But ordinarily a party that seeks to defeat a strong natural inference must bear the burden of showing that some such special circumstance exists. And no one has suggested any such special circumstance here. ... The majority is wrong when it describes the harm threatened plaintiffs as "speculative."</blockquote>The decision also is likely to have implications on a <a href = "/paperchase/2013/02/federal-appeals-court-hears-challenge-to-indefinite-detention-law.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit brought against the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=NDAA">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [JURIST news archive] by a group of journalist and activists. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Kenyan presidential candidate <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [case materials], who is one of the four men charged, asked the ICC earlier this month to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-postpone-trial.php">postpone his trial</a> [JURIST report]. Kenyatta, a former finance minister, argued that his defense team <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/icc-postpones-kenyans-trial/1611113.html">needed more time</a> [VOA report] to respond to evidence revealed to them at the last minute leading up to the trial. The charges against Kenyatta and the other men arise from involvement in the violence following the disputed elections in December 2007 in which 1,200 people were killed and thousands more displaced. The trials, which were set to begin in April, could be postponed until after the court's summer recess in August. The delay must first be approved by ICC judges.

<p>Earlier this month Kenyatta and his co-defendant, former civil service chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials], <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. The two Kenyans had <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in December that, despite their upcoming trials, they would be running together in the next presidential election, scheduled to take place in March. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process.

Bahraini lawyer <a href=" https://twitter.com/Mohamed_AlJishi">Mohammed al-Jishi</a> [twitter account, in Arabic] who represented the protester's family, said the Bahrain court concluded the two police officers fired shots at Fadhel Matruk but did not intend to kill him. The court's decision came a few days after an <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/65638/World/Region/-Bahrain-police-acquitted-of-killing-protester-law.aspx">appeals court affirmed the acquittal</a> [AFP report] of two policemen accused of killing two protesters in a separate incident.  

<p>Numerous legal proceedings have arisen from the 2011 protests. Earlier this month a Bahrain police officer was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-police-officer-sentenced-to-7-years-for-killing-protester.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for fatally shooting a protester. Bahrain authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banned all protests</a> [JURIST report] effective October 2012. In January a court in Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-court-releases-shiite-rights-activist-on-bail-pending-trial.php">released</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafda on bail pending trial for charges of spreading false news to harm security. Also in January the highest Bahraini appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-high-court-rejects-appeals-of-13-imprisoned-rights-activists.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 13 prominent pro-democracy protestors convicted by military tribunal in 2011 on charges of plotting to overthrow the monarchy. In December Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php">commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protesters, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment. Earlier in December the prison sentence for outspoken Bahraini rights activist Nabeel Rajab was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-court-cuts-prison-sentence-for-activist-nabeel-rajab.php">reduced by one year</a> [JURIST report]. In November Amnesty International released a brief detailing how Bahrain had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-continuing-rights-abuses-despite-pledge-to-reform-ai.php">failed to meet its obligations</a> [JURIST report] and promises to ensure respect for human rights and prevent further torture within the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-legislature-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved by the Arkansas House of Representatives</a> last Thursday and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved by the Senate</a> [JURIST reports] just days prior to that. Beebe asserted that the proposed law was unconstitutional, stating that by imposing "a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic abortion before viability, House Bill 1037, if it became law, would squarely contradict Supreme Court precedent" and that the adoption of unconstitutional laws was expensive to the state and its taxpayers. He stated that the last case in Arkansas challenging the constitutionality of an abortion statute cost Arkansas over $148,000 in 1999, and that because of the rising litigation costs a similar suit could be more costly to taxpayers. Beebe's veto <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57571437/arkansas-governor-vetoes-20-week-abortion-bill/">can be overridden</a> [AP report] by a simple majority from the lawmakers.

<p>Beebe has said that he would veto an <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">earlier bill</a> [SB 134, PDF] banning all abortions after the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-approves-bill-banning-abortions-after-fetal-heartbeat-detected.php">detection of a fetal heartbeat</a> [JURIST report]. That bill has been amended several times between the Arkansas House and Senate and is currently <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/bill/2013R/SB134">re-referred to committee</a> [materials]. The current proposed legislation would make Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The whalers claim their activities are permitted under Article 8 of the <a href="http://iwc.int/cache/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [text, PDF], which allows for the taking of whales if a signatory nation has issued them a license. ICR possesses a license issued by Japan. Writing the opinion for the appeals court, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski said of SSCS:<blockquote>You don't need a peg leg or an eye patch. When you ram ships; hurl glass containers of acid; drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders; launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks; and point high-powered lasers at other ships, you are, without a doubt, a pirate, no matter how high-minded you believe your purpose to be.</blockquote>In rebuking the trial court judge's "numerous, serious and obvious errors," Kozinski suggested justice would be better served by remanding the case to a different district court judge selected at random.

<p>Japan's whaling program remains extremely controversial. ICR <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/japan-whalers-file-suit-against-anti-whaling-activists.php">filed the suit</a> [JURIST report] against SSCS in December 2011. In July 2010 a Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/japan-court-convicts-anti-whaling-activist-of-assault-obstruction.php">convicted</a> New Zealand anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune on charges of assault, trespass, destruction of property, illegal possession of a weapon and obstruction of business for <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/japan-authorities-indict-new-zealand.php">boarding a Japanese whaling vessel</a> [JURIST reports] as part of an anti-whaling protest in January of that year. Berthune, who called the charges "bogus," was extradited to New Zealand, and he will not serve prison time unless he returns to Japan. In May 2010 Australia <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">initiated proceedings</a> [JURIST report] when it brought a <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=1&amp;code=aj&amp;case=148&amp;k=64">complaint</a> [materials] against Japan in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] for its whaling practices in the Antarctic.

Businesses, cities, and other organizations filed two amicus curiae briefs with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Tuesday in support of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The groups urged the court to strike down the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DOMA-business-brief.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [brief, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/DOMPRP8.aspx">US v. Windsor</a> [docket] and <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Perry-BusinessAmicusBrief.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [brief, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket]. The businesses include financial institutions, medical centers, airlines, energy and high technology businesses, law and professional firms, retailers, restaurants, non-profit organizations, and several others. Both briefs state an interest for the businesses in their desires to recruit, retain, and secure a talented workforce, and state that the laws in question impinge upon those interests. In particular, the brief in <span class=casename>Hollingsworth</span> states how <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+8">news archive</a>] leads talented employees to choose to live in states other than California, creating recruitment difficulties. The brief in <span class=casename>Windsor</span> explains:<blockquote>The capital of modern enterprises is in many ways a human capital. Success depends on the talent, morale and motivation of the workforce for private and public employers alike. To attract the best employees and colleagues, amici must offer robust workplace benefits and a workplace ethos of transparent fairness. ... Benefits packages, especially health-care and retirement benefits, are a direct contributor to employee loyalty. Satisfied and engaged workers are more productive and perform better across a variety of metrics than less-satisfied colleagues. Workplace benefits enhance the employer/employee relationship, which in turn is a key to institutional success. To compete effectively in the modern employment market, amici strive to offer workplace benefits to their employees on an equitable basis.</blockquote>Additionally, the brief in <span class=casename>Windsor</span> cites challenges dual marriage regime created by <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">DOMA</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] uniquely burdens the employers by requiring separate books and tax treatments to deal with same-sex marriages of employees on state and federal levels, and forcing those businesses to endure unnecessary cost and administrative complexity. Both briefs urge the Supreme Court to affirm the appellate court decisions.

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage is an ongoing controversy in the US. Earlier this week attorneys for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/nyregion/edith-windsor-gay-widow-revels-in-supreme-court-fight.html?pagewanted=all">Edith Windsor</a> [NYT profile], the respondent in <span class=casename>US v. Windsor</span>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doma-challenger-files-brief-with-us-supreme-court.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/Brief_of_Petitioner_United_States_(Merits).pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] with the Supreme Court arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional. That brief added to the three that were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/three-briefs-filed-with-supreme-court-in-case-challenging-doma.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last week, including one filed by the Obama administration arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional and one filed by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) defending the law's constitutionality. Last month the Supreme Court received briefs in both cases <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">defending the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of both Proposition 8 and Section 3 of DOMA. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in both cases in December. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Jaradat died while in interrogations at an Israeli facility. Initially, Israel claimed the cause of death was a heart attack, but this was not included in the preliminary autopsy. Palestinian Authority's chief pathologist, Dr. Saber Aloul, also observed the autopsy and expressed concern that the body showed signs of torture. Given this discrepancy, Falk has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44236&Cr=palestin&Cr1=#.US5VDolevlM">urged that an independent international investigation</a> [UN news center report] be conducted. Falk also reiterated Israel's obligation to deal with prisoners humanely in a way consistent with its obligations under humanitarian law.

<p>Israel has been criticized for its treatment of Palestinian prisoners, and going on hunger strike to protest administrative detention by Israeli authorities has recently become a common tactic by Palestinian prisoners. Earlier this month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody are in poor health. UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk went further and called for the immediate release of the three men. In June Falk called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-chief-calls-on-israel-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release two Palestinian detainees</a> [JURIST report] who have been on hunger strike for 82 and 58 days to protest their administrative detention. Earlier in June <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/israel-urged-to-release-palestinian-detainees.php">release all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] of conscience and administrative detainees or immediately try them under international fair trial standards. In May UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-should-try-or-release-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-un.php">try or release more than 1,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who had been on hunger strike. Earlier that same month, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-supreme-court-declines-to-free-palestinian-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] two detainees who had been on hunger strike in their appeal seeking release from detention. During the same month, Falk <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-israel-prison-conditions.php">expressed his concern</a> [JURIST report] for the continued human rights violations in Israel's prisons. He called on the country to comply with the international standards of how to treat detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a deal reached by Nieto's <a href="http://www.nndb.com/org/767/000095482/">Institutional Revolutionary Party</a> (IRP) [party website] and two opposition parties, the reforms will attempt to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexican-president-signs-education-reform-18592352">create a new system of school standards</a> [AP report] for hiring and promoting teachers based on merit. While the president himself <a href="http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/educational-reform-everyones-commitment/">wrote</a> [statement] simply that the "major purpose of this reform is to make education a force to transform Mexico," many <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/26/us-mexico-education-idUSBRE91P0WU20130226">suggest</a> [Reuters op-ed] that the legislation intends to curb alleged abuses by the 1.5 million-member <a href="http://www.snte.org.mx/">National Union of Education Workers</a> (NUEW) [union website, in Spanish], which is the largest labor syndicate in Latin America and is said to control the country's education system. Simultaneously, the new reform seeks to help the country's struggling youth by increasing the number of Mexican students who finish middle school to 80 percent and the proportion of those who complete high school to 40 percent. Additionally, it will allow for the first census of the country's education system, and it will extend learning hours in roughly 40,000 public schools across Mexico.

<p>On Tuesday, a day after Nieto signed the education reforms, controversial NUEW leader Elba Esther Gordillo was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/world/americas/leader-of-mexican-teachers-union-arrested.html?_r=0">arrested</a> [NYT report] for allegations that she embezzled approximately $200 million for personal expenses that include California houses, plastic surgery and artwork. Known as "La Maestra," Gordillo is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-21608426">considered a figurehead</a> [BBC report] in the country's political scene and a powerful kingmaker throughout Mexico. In September, then-president-elect Nieto <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mexico-president-elect-proposes-reforms-to-increase-access-to-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a proposal for similar constitutional reforms that would increase government transparency. He also announced plans to propose a national anti-corruption commission. Nieto's presidential election victory was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/mexico-authorities-confirm-presidential-election-results.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] in July, thereby making him the first member of the IRP in 12 years to serve as president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shelby County argued that "the South has changed" and that the preclearance requirements were not justified by the "antiquated" formula for determining which jurisdictions are covered by Section 5, the "extraordinary" federalism and the financial burdens of preclearance. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeatedly questioned whether, even if the standard for determining what jurisdictions fell under Section 5 was improper, Shelby County had suffered any harm. Kagan argued that Alabama would be captured under any formulation of the standard because it was either worst or second worst, depending on the metric, in terms of its voting record. Sotomayor described Shelby county as "a county whose record is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to start with." Justice Antonin Scalia expressed concern that the Voting Rights Act would be renewed into perpetuity because of political pressure and argued that the government had not adequately demonstrated a justification for treating these states differently. Justice Anthony Kennedy appeared to be the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/argument-recap-voting-law-in-peril-maybe/">swing vote</a> [SCOTUSblog report] leaning towards invalidating the law and questioned whether the jurisdictions could effectively move forward from the past unless they could act as sovereigns, rather than under the "trusteeship" of the federal government.

<p>The Supreme Court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-133.pdf">American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant</a> [transcript, PDF] to determine whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] allows courts to nullify arbitration agreements if the agreements do not permit class arbitration of a federal law claim. The plaintiffs in the case are several retail businesses bringing a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sherman_antitrust_act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] claim after being forced to accept American Express credit cards and debit cards, with their associated higher fees, by their agreement to accept American Express charge cards. American Express argues that the enforceability of an arbitration agreement cannot be conditioned upon the availability of class certification. American Express further argued that "[t]he whole point of arbitration... is to expand the scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be brought in an efficient and cost-effective manner" and that consumers could even share in the costs of experts. Kagan questioned whether preventing class action suits effectively foreclosed potential claimants from pursuing their claims because the amount of their individual damages was so small compared to the costs of bring even an arbitration suit that no one would actually bring a claim. However, Justice Stephen Breyer questioned whether the expert reports required for arbitration really needed to be very expensive. The plaintiffs argued that American Express was using its market power to impose contractual terms that effectively made the arbitration of an antitrust claim impossible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to permit a class action lawsuit by shareholders against <a href="http://www.amgen.com/">Amgen</a> [corporate website], a biotechnology company. The court ruled that plaintiffs did not have to prove the materiality of their claims of misrepresentation and omission during the class-certification phase of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] class action lawsuit. The opinion was authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The Court held:<blockquote>Although we have cautioned that a court's class-certification analysis must be "rigorous" and may "entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim," Rule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage. Merits questions may be considered to the extent&#8212;but only to the extent&#8212;that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.</blockquote>This is a clear indication that the merits of the claims themselves are not the issues to be litigated during class certification.

<p>This opinion is a departure from the position taken by the court in other recent class action lawsuits that had a trend of raising the standard for class certification. In June 2011, in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-277">Wal-Mart v. Dukes</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a group of women seeking to recover damages from Wal-Mart failed to meet the requirements for class certification by failing to prove that class members have common "questions of law or fact."  In April 2011, in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-893">AT&#38;T v. Concepcion</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rules-federal-arbitration-law-preempts-state-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that federal arbitration law preempted state law and prohibited class status when contracts contain arbitration clauses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues." During the many police searches, important documents and files have reportedly been seized from organizations. "With the referendum less than two weeks away, human rights defenders who promote participation have a critical role to play," said Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Defenders/MARGARETSEKAGGYA_CV.pdf">Margaret Sekaggya</a> [CV, PDF]. "They must be protected by the Government and attempts to stifle criticism must end."

<p>Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to ensure "credible, free and fair elections." In November the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/+-Defenseurs-des-droits-humains-+?lang=en">Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders</a> (OBS) [FIDH backgrounder] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/zimbabwe-rights-defenders-facing-harassment-report.php">human rights defenders in Zimbabwe continue to be harassed</a> [JURIST report]. Last March various human rights groups urged South African courts to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-urges-south-africa-to-prosecute-zimbabwe-crimes-against-humanity.php">prosecute</a> Zimbabwe for <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">violations including torture and forced labor</a> [JURIST reports] of civilian workers in illegal mining camps. In June 2009 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that Zimbabwe was still experiencing serious <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/zimbabwe-government-urged-to-address.php">human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], such as the arrest and detention of human rights activists, and needed to confront issues that led to such problems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [JURIST report] that the statute of limitations under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2462">28 USC &#167; 2462</a> [text] begins tolling when the fraud occurs, not when it is discovered. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court. The federal government and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argued that the government should be able to avail itself to the fraud discovery rule as determined by <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15664637107187658307&q=247+U.+S.+435&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Exploration Co. v. United States</a> [opinion]. Roberts wrote to explain why the court would not be extending this rule to the government.<blockquote>There are good reasons why the fraud discovery rule has not been extended to Government enforcement actions for civil penalties. The discovery rule exists in part to preserve the claims of victims who do not know they are injured and who reasonably do not inquire as to any injury. Usually when a private party is injured, he is immediately aware of that injury and put on notice that his time to sue is running. But when the injury is self-concealing, private parties may be unaware that they have been harmed. Most of us do not live in a state of constant investigation; absent any reason to think we have been injured, we do not typically spend our days looking for evidence that we were lied to or defrauded. And the law does not require that we do so. Instead, courts have developed the discovery rule, providing that the statute of limitations in fraud cases should typically begin to run only when the injury is or reasonably could have been discovered. The same conclusion does not follow for the Government in the context of enforcement actions for civil penalties.The SEC, for example, is not like an individual victim who relies on apparent injury to learn of a wrong. Rather, a central "mission" of the Commission is to "investigat[e] potential violations of the federal securities laws." Unlike the private party who has no reason to suspect fraud, the SEC's very purpose is to root it out, and it has many legal tools at hand to aid in that pursuit. It can demand that securities brokers and dealers submit detailed trading information. It can require investment advisers to turn over their comprehensive books and records at any time. And even without filing suit, it can subpoena any documents and witnesses it deems relevant or material to an investigation.</blockquote>The court reversed the <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+653+F.3d+49&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=2384782728974139574&scilh=0">decision</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Under the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], every Canadian is entitled to "freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication." This provision is limited by the <a href="www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/S24-1.pdf">Saskatchewan Human Rights Code</a> [PDF], which imposes specific prohibitions on publication and expression of speech "that exposes or tends to expose to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground." The court stated that such limitations were demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, and that the law appropriately balanced the fundamental values underlying freedom of expression with the competing Charter value of commitment to equality and respect for group identity and the inherent dignity owed to all human beings:<blockquote>the benefits of the suppression of hate speech and its harmful effects outweigh the detrimental effect of restricting expression which, by its nature, does little to promote the values underlying freedom of expression. Section 14(1)(b) of the Code represents a choice by the legislature to discourage hate speech and its harmful effects on both the vulnerable group and on society as a whole, in a manner that is conciliatory and remedial. In cases such as the present, the process under the legislation can provide guidance to individuals ... so that they can continue expressing their views in a way that avoids falling within the narrow scope of expression captured by the statutory prohibition. The protection of vulnerable groups from the harmful effects emanating from hate speech is of such importance as to justify the minimal infringement of expression that results from the restriction of materials of this kind.</blockquote>The ruling came in the case of activist William Whatcott, who was originally fined $17,500 for distributing anti-gay pamphlets.

<p>Maintaining an appropriate balance between limiting hate speech and respecting freedom of expression remains controversial. Following the release of an anti-Islam film in September, which incited <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19572694">riots throughout the middle east</a> [BBC report], several countries have been scrutinizing exactly how far the freedom of speech should go. In February, JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wethenet.eu/about/lauteur/">Felix Treguer</a>, Policy and Legal Analyst at <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a>, <a href="http://jurist.org/hotline/2013/02/felix-treguer-twitter-france.php">discussed</a> [JURIST comment] the "judicial guerilla war" in France being waged on "hateful" Internet content, unduly stifling free speech. In November an independent UN expert urged countries to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-expert-urges-countries-to-combat-online-hate-speech.php">combat hate speech on the Internet</a> [JURIST report], while simultaneously protecting freedom of speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Argentinian courts have long <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-27/news/sns-rt-us-argentina-iranbre90q0e9-20130127_1_argentina-and-iran-interpol-arrest-warrants-foreign-minister-hector-timerman">accused Iran of sponsoring the attack</a> [Reuters report], which killed 85 people, and in 2007 Argentinian authorities secured Interpol arrest warrants for five Iranians, including current Iranian Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi. Argentine <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar">President Cristina Fernandez</a> [official website, in Spanish] favors the move, in spite of <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/125243/amia-to-take-iran-bill-to-sc">objections from the Jewish community</a> [<em>Buenos Aires Herald</em> report], Israel and the US. The agreement, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/argentina-iran-create-commission-to-investigate-1994-community-center-bombing.php">initially signed</a> [JURIST report] in January, will create an independent truth commission, to be composed of five judges who are jointly nominated foreign legal experts having residency in neither Argentina nor Iran. The commission is to conduct an investigation and prepare a report with recommendations on how to proceed with the case based on the laws of each country and within the framework of international law. 

<p>Iran drew additional ire from the US in January when an Iranian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-court-sentences-us-pastor-to-eight-years-in-prison.php">sentenced an American-Iranian pastor to eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for threatening national security through his leadership in Christian house churches. Earlier that month Iranian lawyer and prominent human rights activist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasrin+Sotoudeh">Nasrin Sotoudeh</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/iran-human-rights-lawyer-temporarily-released-from-prison.php">temporarily released after spending over two years in prison</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran for her September 2010 conviction for propaganda and harming national security. Iranian authorities pursued Sotoudeh because she represented political activists and sought to highlight the execution of juveniles in the country. Last month Argentina sentenced former Interior Minister Jaime Smart to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">life in prison for crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] during the nation's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>].

Samsung accused Apple of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gS3VfspLr14yyPxy4-tuTadNd4rQ?docId=CNG.56014fa675f9579c3dd3064b05c5f742.581">stealing its data transmission technology</a> [AFP report] used in Apple's iPhone smartphones, but the court dismissed the challenge. The alleged patent infringement involved technologies for optimizing transmission and reducing power usage during data transmission, reducing data transmission errors, and tethering a phone to a PC to enable the latter to utilize the phone's wireless data connection. The South Korean company had sought an injunction to prevent its competitor from manufacturing and selling its products in Japan. Samsung stated that it will take necessary steps to protect its intellectual property rights. It is unclear whether the company will appeal the recent decision. 

<p>This was the latest ruling in the global dispute between the two companies. In August of last year, the same court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-court-dismissed-apple-patent-suit-against-samsung.php">dismissed Apple's claim</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung holding that latter did not violate Apple's patents of synchronizing music and video data. An <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appeal followed</a> [JURIST report] two months later. Last month a judge for the US <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-finds-that-samsungs-infringement-of-apple-patents-was-not-willful.php">Samsung did not willfully infringe</a> [JURIST report] Apple's patents. The judge's ruling partially abrogates the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">jury verdict</a> [JURIST report] finding that Samsung willfully infringed Apple's asserted patents. However, the judge declined to overturn the jury's findings on validity and infringement and also refused to grant Samsung a new trial on the grounds that the trial was allegedly manifestly unfair. In December Apple agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/apple-withdraws-patent-claim-against-samsung.php">withdraw claims</a> [JURIST report] against a Samsung product that Samsung asserts has never been sold in the US in the second of the two patent infringement cases taking place in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. In October a Dutch court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. During same month, a UK court ruled similarly in case regarding Apple's <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">design patent</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Emphasizing that the allegations of prisoner abuse require further investigation, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] Chairman <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/ABOUT/CourtOrganization/Chambers/TrialChamberII/tabid/89/Default.aspx">El-Hadji Malick Sow</a> [SCSL backgrounder] explained how many of the system's 150,000 prisoners have been found "guilty of political crimes such as expressing antisocialist sentiments, having unsound ideology, or criticizing the government." In addition to reports that detainees are often not told why they have been arrested or when they will be released, Special Rapporteur on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions</a> [official website] Christof Heyns added that those who attempt to escape are allegedly executed by firing squad or hanging. According to the group, prisoners also endure some of the most egregious violations of international law, including forced labor with little food and no access to healthcare, and torture for breaking camp rules, as Special Rapporteur on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/SRTortureIndex.aspx">torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment</a> [official website] Juan Mendez described. Mendez also explained that reports indicate the raping and sexual exploitation of female prisoners by prison guards, and that "resultant pregnancies are met with forced abortion or killing." Darusman will present a comprehensive report of all findings on North Korea's human rights situation to the UN <a href="www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on March 11.

<p>Earlier this month Darusman similarly <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UNHRC and the UN <a href="www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] to investigate human rights violations in North Korea. In November, he <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the country's lack of development in human rights, and called on its new leader, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kim+jong-un">news archive</a>], to remedy the matter. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php">condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the drop in individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdown on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Harris contended that the purpose of the ban "was to take away the right of gay and lesbians couples to call their union a 'marriage' and to strip loving relationships of validation and dignity under the law," and thus should be deemed in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause</a> [text; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Cornell LII backgrounder</a>] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">US Constitution</a> [text]. She added that this purpose is unsupported by a legitimate or rational state interest, and that California actually has a state interest in protecting children to see the law invalidated, as 50,000 children are being raised by same-sex parents and should not risk "feeling inferior because their family unit is not validated or honored by the law." In an additional argument, Harris contended that the federal government sponsors of Proposition 8 cannot defend the law in the Supreme Court because they lack proper legal standing to bring an appeal. Unlike state officials, she argued, federal officials "lack enforcement authority" and therefore do not suffer a necessary injury-in-fact as a result of a district court's judgment. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket], on March 26.

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage is an ongoing controversy in the US. Earlier this week businesses, cities, and other organizations <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/businesses-back-same-sex-marriage-in-briefs-to-supreme-court.php">filed two <em>amicus curiae</em> briefs</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court also in support of same-sex marriage, urging the court to strike down the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/DOMPRP8.aspx">US v. Windsor</a> [docket] in addition to Proposition 8. Also this week, attorneys for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/nyregion/edith-windsor-gay-widow-revels-in-supreme-court-fight.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Edith Windsor</a> [NYT profile], the plaintiff, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/doma-challenger-files-brief-with-us-supreme-court.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the court arguing that DOMA is unconstitutional. Last week, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/three-briefs-filed-with-supreme-court-in-case-challenging-doma.php">three other briefs were filed</a> [JURIST report], including one written by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/">Office of the Solicitor General</a> [official website], which argued that DOMA is unconstitutional, and one written by the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG), which defended the law's constitutionality. Last month, the Supreme Court received briefs in both cases <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-receives-opening-briefs-in-same-sex-marriage-cases.php">defending the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of both Proposition 8 and Section 3 of DOMA. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> in both cases</a> [JURIST report] in December. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ban became law immediately following the Senate's 19-14 vote to override the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] issued by Beebe on Tuesday. In his <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/newsroom/index.php?do:newsDetail=1&news_id=3796">letter</a> [official statement] accompanying his veto of the 20-week ban Beebe said he decided to attempt to block the bill because: <blockquote>"[I]t would impose a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic (<i>sic</i>) abortion before viability, House Bill 1037, if it became law, would squarely contradict Supreme Court precedent. When I was sworn in as Governor I took an oath to preserve, protect, and defend both the Arkansas Constitution and the Constitution of the United States. I take that oath seriously"</blockquote>Beebe also claimed his veto was to prevent dedicating state funds to defending the law which he felt was contrary to the decision in <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>. According to Beebe, the last case in Arkansas challenging the constitutionality of an abortion statute cost Arkansas over $148,000 in 1999, and that because of the rising litigation costs a similar suit could be more costly to taxpayers.

<p>Immediately after overriding the governor's veto, the Arkansas Senate passed the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [SB 134, PDF] to restrict abortions after 12 weeks, which Beebe has previously said he would veto. The Senate's override makes Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manning, who is <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-soldier-formally-charged-for-leaking-information-to-wikileaks.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with violating the Espionage Act, pleaded <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/28/17132690-bradley-manning-pleads-not-guilty-to-aiding-the-enemy-admits-less-serious-charges?lite">not guilty</a> [NBC news report] to the most serious charge against him, aiding the enemy. Additionally, Manning read a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/28/us/manning-plea/?hpt=us_c2">statement</a> [CNN report] offering, for the first time, his rationale for leaking the documents. Manning claimed he became depressed about the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan and wanted the public to know about the "ground reality" but did not believe the information could harm the US. Thursday's plea comes one day after US Army Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over Manning's case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a defense motion to dismiss the charges against Manning because he he has not been provided with a speedy trial. 

<p>Since his arrest in 2010, Manning's case has been controversial. In January Lind <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/wikileaks-judge-prosecutors-must-prove-defendant-knew-he-was-aiding-enemy.php">ruled</a> that prosecutors must prove that Manning knew he was aiding the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports]. In November Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a partial guilty plea to several of the minor charges against Manning. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly withheld from the defense during discovery. Earlier that month Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss 8 of the 22 charges against Manning after his defense argued that they were unconstitutionally vague.

The appeals chamber found that the court's trial chamber had failed to apply the law correctly when it determined that "specific direction is not an element of aiding and abetting liability." Because the lower court had erred in its interpretation of the law, the appeals chamber rendered its decision <em>de novo</em> and concluded the evidence against Perisic was not convincing "beyond a reasonable doubt." The decision to overturn the conviction means that Perisic is once more free and that the ICTY has not convicted any Serbian official for war crimes committed in Bosnia and Croatia.

<p>Perisic was found guilty of 12 out of 13 charges, including aiding and abetting murders occurring during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Srebrenica">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], inhumane acts, attacks on civilians, unjust persecutions and having knowingly supplied "extensive logistical assistance" to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and the Army of Serbian Krajina (SVK) that would be used to torture and kill hundreds of Muslim civilians. He was also found guilty on the basis of command responsibility for the inhumane acts of his officers and subsequently failing to punish them. In March 2011 UN prosecutors demanded that <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-prosecutors-demand-life-sentence-for-ex-yugoslav-army-chief.php">Perisic receive a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Bosnian Muslims in the early 1990s.

The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the same version of the bill earlier this month, and it will now go to President Barack Obama for final approval. The president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/28/statement-president-house-passage-violence-against-women-act">welcomed</a> [press release] the passage of the legislation "as an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear" and is expected to sign the bill into law. House Republicans initially sought to pass a version of the bill that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/politics/congress-passes-reauthorization-of-violence-against-women-act.html?_r=0">excluded specific protections</a> [NYT report] for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender victims of domestic violence. The bill reauthorizes the VAWA for five years and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/violence-against-women-act-passed-by-house-sent-to-obama-for-signature/2013/02/28/c540f058-81b4-11e2-b99e-6baf4ebe42df_story.html">allocates $660 million</a> [WP report] each year to be spent on battered women's shelters, victims advocates, rape-prevention education and other programs.

<p>Since its expiration in 2011, the reauthorization of the VAWA has been controversial. Last week the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13012&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-us-congress-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.php">report</a>] the US Congress to renew the VAWA. In 2011 Manjoo issued a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.26.Add.5_AEV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">report</a>] which found a continued prevalence of violence against women and discriminatory treatment of women in the US, with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. Last year the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate both passed versions of the VAWA reauthorization but were <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/senate-renews-violence-women-act-article-1.1262231">unable to reach a compromise</a> [AP report] over the prosecutorial power of tribal courts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Zakaria Amara, Saad Khalid and Saad Gaya, who were members of the "Toronto 18" terrorist group, were given sentences ranging from 14 years to life for their participation in a failed plot to enact a series of violent attacks on civilians, public officials and government buildings. Their appeal sought to lighten the sentences, asking the Supreme Court to consider the constitutionality of sentencing guidelines for terrorist convicts. The court on Thursday said it would not hear the appeal without issuing any further comment. 

<p>The accused leader of the terrorist group, Zakaria Amara, <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/accused-toronto-18-leader-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 to charges of planning to bomb three targets in Ontario. The same month Saad Gaya plead guilty while another member of the group, Ali Mohamed Dirie, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. In September 2009, the first of the group to plead guilty, Saad Khalid, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/canada-court-sentences-toronto-18.php">14 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], though the Canadian government sought to alter that sentence for time already served. The first of the suspects to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/canada-convicts-first-defendant-under.php">convicted under Canada's post-9/11 terrorism law</a> was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/canada-court-sentences-and-releases.php">sentenced and released</a> [JURIST reports] in May, with the court citing time served.

The city of Lleida, in Catalonia, was the first Spanish city to impose such a ban, but only about 3 percent of its population is Muslim. The city law was previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by a Spanish appeals court which found that the law was permissible for identification and security purposes. In its ruling, the Supreme Court found that the city of Lleida had not adequately established that the ban on veils would improve security and that the law prevented individuals from practicing religious traditions. 

<p>Burqas and other symbols of Islam have been a controversial subject in Europe. In July the Netherlands announced that a ban on burqas would <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/netherlands-plans-to-ban-muslim-face-veils.php">go forward</a> [JURIST report] later this year. Proponents of the Netherlands ban said the purpose was to stop people from being able to commit crimes and remain undetected by concealing their identities and covering their faces. Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banned</a> [JURIST report] burqas in July 2011.

Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, arguing that California's ban on same-sex marriage, known as <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+8">news archive</a>], violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court will determine whether amending California's constitution to limit marriage to a union between one man and one woman is unconstitutional. The government's brief argues that by extending substantive rights to same-sex couples through domestic partnerships, the justification for Proposition 8 is undermined. The brief states:<blockquote>That California law authorizes domestic partnerships for gay and lesbian couples and expressly grants them the incidents of marriage--a fact about California's legal regime that could be taught just like any other fact relevant to a class--makes this interest all the more tenuous as a purported justification for Proposition 8. California's extension of all of the substantive rights and responsibilities of marriage to gay and lesbian domestic partners particularly undermines the justifications for Proposition 8. It indicates that Proposition 8's withholding of the designation of marriage is not based on an interest in promoting responsible procreation and child-rearing--petitioners' central claimed justification for the initiative--but instead on impermissible prejudice.</blockquote>The Supreme Court is scheduled to begin oral arguments for the <span class="casename">Hollingsworth</span> case on March 26.

<p>Last week, advocates for same-sex marriage <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-supreme-court-urged-to-strike-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">submitted briefs</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court in the <span class="casename">Hollingsworth</span> case for the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Perry-Respondents-Merits-Brief.pdf">respondent couples</a>, as well as for the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Perry-San-Franciscos-Brief.pdf">City and County of San Fransisco</a> [briefs, PDF]. The advocates urged the court to find California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, claiming that the law served only to "stigmatize gay men and lesbians." The ban, Proposition 8, was a voter-approved state measure to limit the meaning of marriage to include only a man and a woman. In 2012, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], as it "stripped same-sex couples of...an important right." In addition to this case, the court is also scheduled to hear a challenge to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-104hr3396enr/pdf/BILLS-104hr3396enr.pdf">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] this month. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Thursday's hearing marked the first time that the plaintiffs <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/haitis-baby-doc-makes-court-appearance-18619010">confronted</a> [AP report] Duvalier. Duvalier had ignored three previous summonses before his appearance in court on Thursday. A judge told Duvalier that he would be jailed if he did not appear before the court after the fourth summons was issued. The lawyer for the plaintiffs criticized the previously rebuffed summonses as evidence of Haiti's failing justice system. The legal proceedings began with Duvalier's lawyer requesting that the proceedings take place behind closed doors. The judges asked Duvalier about political prisoners that were locked up, tortured, and killed during his time in office.

<p>Last week a Haitian judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/former-haiti-dictator-again-summoned-to-court-after-failing-to-appear.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Duvalier to appear in court for a hearing on whether he should face charges for human rights abuses. The summons followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/haiti-court-orders-former-president-duvalier-to-appear-at-human-rights-hearing.php">previous order</a> [JURIST report] from nearly two weeks ago by a Haitian appeals court for Duvalier to appear for the hearings, a directive which the ex-president failed to follow]. Duvalier returned to Haiti in 2011 after 25 years in exile, prompting an investigation for crimes committed from 1971-1986. Last January a magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">dismissed human rights charges against Duvalier</a> [JURIST report], including allegations of rape, torture and murder, on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6410">District Court of The Hague</a> [official website] sentenced Basebya to six years and eight months in prison for her role in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>]. The court found that Basebya incited genocide by leading meetings of a radical ethnic Hutu party and sang a song that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/dutch-court-convicts-rwandan-born-dutchwoman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda/2013/03/01/7ac4fa18-8279-11e2-a671-0307392de8de_story.html">called for the murder of all ethnic Tutsis</a> [AP report]. Around 800,000 Rwandans, primarily Tutsis, were killed during the 1994 genocide. The court, however, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21632819">cleared Basebya of more serious charges</a> [BBC report], such as perpetrating genocide and murder. Basebya is the first Dutch citizen to be convicted of crimes relating to the Rwandan genocide. Her lawyer plans to appeal the ruling.

<p>Two weeks ago a court in Norway sentenced a Rwandan man to 21 years for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">being an accomplice to the 1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST report]. In January a Rwandan genocide suspect was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France. Earlier in January the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=7&mnid=2">Augustin Ngirabatware</a> [case materials], sentencing him to 35 years in prison and concluding the tribunal's final trial. Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. In December the UN Security Council unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-extends-terms-of-rwanda-criminal-tribunal-justices.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to extend the term of office of five judges of the ICTR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report identifies and elaborates on advances and challenges within six human rights "thematic priorities" established for the years 2010 to 2013. These include discrimination, impunity relating to democratic society, poverty resulting from global economic downturn, migration, violence and human rights mechanisms within international law. Pillay characterized 2012 as a year of "daunting" human rights crises including armed conflict in Syria, Palestine, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have resulted in thousands of deaths, massive displacement and a general "climate of impunity." In addition, the report recounts the office's efforts to further delicate political transition in nations including Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. Pillay also expressed concern regarding significant budget restraints and "ever-growing" workload, and urged the international community to respond with resources proportionate to the "high expectations" placed on the human rights system. The report elaborates on the High Commissioner's general mission:<blockquote>More than ever, the imperative of putting people and their rights first is paramount. This is the raison d'etre of the United Nations, and must be reflected both in the decisions of its intergovernmental bodies and throughout the work of the Organization. It must be at the very heart of the Organization's peace, security, development and humanitarian agendas. I encourage the Human Rights Council to continue to play its role to ensure that it does.</blockquote>According to the UN, Pillay is expected to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44255&Cr=pillay&Cr1=#.UTDkYqX3DV1">present a fact-finding report</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] on March 11 detailing atrocities and displacement in Mali.

<p>The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has addressed a variety of human rights abuses around the world in the past. In February Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-international-community-must-continue-to-prevent-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to continue to prevent human rights abuses and hold perpetrators accountable. Speaking at the opening of the 22nd session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Pillay specifically mentioned the ongoing situations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan and Syria. Also in February, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody are in poor health from hunger strikes protesting Israel's use of administrative detention. In the same timeframe, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">unveiled a report</a> [JURIST report] criticizing Sri Lanka for failing to investigate widespread reports of killings and other atrocities during the latter days of the nation's 26-year civil war it fought with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Also in February, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urged-comprehensive-approach-to-sexual-violence-in-south-africa.php">expressed shock and sadness</a> [JURIST report] concerning the brutal rape and murder of 17-year-old Anene Booysen in South Africa. Pillay urged South Africa to take a stronger approach to prevent the ongoing sexual violence incidents against tens of thousands of South African women every year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/i1053.pdf">initiative</a> [I-1053, PDF] was approved by voters on multiple occasions, but the majority ruled that the language of the state's constitution is clear and unequivocal. <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/LAWSANDAGENCYRULES/Pages/constitution.aspx">Article II, section 22</a> [constitution, text] states that no bill shall become a law unless a majority of the members elected to each house vote in its favor. The court held that this provision sets both a minimum and a maximum voting requirement and therefore the super-majority requirement violates article II, section 22 by requiring certain legislation to receive a two-thirds vote. The court concluded:<blockquote>Our holding today is not a judgment on the wisdom of requiring a supermajority for the passage of tax legislation. Such judgment is left to the legislative branch of our government. Should the people and the legislature still wish to require a supermajority vote for tax legislation, they must do so through constitutional amendment, not through legislation.</blockquote>In a dissenting opinion, Associate chief justice Charles Johnson criticized the ruling, accusing the court of interfering in political issues.

<p>In 2010 Washington state voters overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/washington-state-votes-down-attempt-to-create-state-income-tax.php">rejected an attempt to institute an income tax</a> [JURIST report], with over 65 percent of the electorate voting against the initiative. Washington is one of seven states in the US that does <a href="http://dor.wa.gov/content/FindTaxesAndRates/IncomeTax/Default.aspx">not have a personal income tax</a> [DOR backgrounder], instead raising revenue through sales taxes and business taxes. Voters have rejected any attempts to create personal income tax, through several ballot initiatives. Although a graduated income tax was accepted in 1932, the state supreme court found it unconstitutional in 1933. The court held that income was property and that Article VII, Section 1 of the <a href="http://www.leg.wa.gov/lawsandagencyrules/pages/constitution.aspx">state constitution</a> [text] precludes the non-uniform taxation of property.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Senate bill would also ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines that hold more than ten bullets. The bill also places restrictions on gun ownership based on mental health, banning firearm purchases for anyone who was involuntarily committed to a mental health facility for any period of time, and imposing some restrictions on individuals who voluntarily commit themselves to such facilities. 

<p>In the wake of the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder], the <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST comment] has been at the center of attention in Washington, DC, and state capitols across the nation. In mid-January, on the one-month anniversary of the Newtown shooting, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] announced his signing of <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws, as well as urging Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.

Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent Bahraini human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17793857">Abdulhadi al-Khawaja</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdulhadi+al-Khawaja">news archive</a>], and has served <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-activists-daughter-sentenced-to-two-months-in-jail-for-tearing-up-picture-of-king.php">previous jail terms</a> [JURIST report] for tearing up a picture of Bahrain's king, destruction of government property and organizing anti-government protests. At the end of last year, al-Khawaja published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/opinion/bahrain-a-brutal-ally.html?_r=0">op-ed</a> [text] in the <em>New York Times</em> in which she described the human rights situation in Bahrain and some of the hardships her family and friends have faced. 

<p>Earlier this week, the Bahrain Higher Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-court-acquits-2-policemen-in-protester-death.php">acquitted two police officers</a> [JURIST report] in the shooting death of a Shiite protester during the nation's pro-democracy protests in Manama that began in February 2011. Last month a Bahrain police officer was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-police-officer-sentenced-to-7-years-for-killing-protester.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for fatally shooting a protester. Bahrain authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banned all protests</a> [JURIST report] effective October 2012. In January a court in Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-court-releases-shiite-rights-activist-on-bail-pending-trial.php">released</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafda on bail pending trial for charges of spreading false news to harm security. Also in January the highest Bahraini appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-high-court-rejects-appeals-of-13-imprisoned-rights-activists.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 13 prominent pro-democracy protestors convicted by military tribunal in 2011 on charges of plotting to overthrow the monarchy. In December Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php">commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protesters, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment.

The new law would not charge royalties to search engines, including <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/index.html">Google</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>], for displaying short passages of text from articles. This provision should assuage previous concerns and campaigns against the potential for a "Google tax." The bill passed with a 293-243 vote, and still needs approval from the upper house of Parliament, the <a href="http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_330/EN/Home/homepage__node.html?__nnn=true">Bundesrat</a> [official website]. 

<p>In recent years, Google has faced both international and national criticism over its privacy policy. In April the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-viacom-copyright-infringement-case-against-youtube.php">overturned an order</a> [JURIST report] dismissing a $1 billion copyright infringement suit against Google, by <a href="http://www.viacom.com/aboutviacom/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> [corporate websites], for Google's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [media website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] service. Last March a Japanese court ordered Google to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/japan-court-orders-google-to-remove-search-terms-in-privacy-case.php">remove certain search terms</a> [JURIST report] that a Japanese man claimed violated his privacy, by suggesting his name in connection with crimes he did not commit. In February 2012 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a suit from the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, asking the <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to block Google's proposed privacy policy changes. The new policy allows a user's information to be shared among different Google products, including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps. In April 2010,Germany's Federal Court of Justice ruled that the use of <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-germany-high-court-rule-google-did-not-violate-copyright-laws.php">thumbnail preview images</a> [JURIST report] pulled from websites by Google is not a violation of copyright law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Michael Shipp <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/mar/01/judge-deals-setback-new-jerseys-sports-gambling-ef/">ruled</a> [AP report] that the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C178.txt">Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) </a> [text] is constitutional, even though it is extremely unpopular in the state. PASPA only allows gambling in only four states, which do not include New Jersey. Shipp <a href="http://www.courierpostonline.com/viewart/20130301/NEWS01/303010068">rejected New Jersey's arguments</a> [<em>Courier Post</em> report] that PASPA violates constitutional guarantees of state sovereignty and equal protection, saying that if New Jersey citizens disagree with the act, they should seek to have Congress repeal it rather than fight it in the courts. New Jersey <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> plans to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official websites].

<p>Sports gambling has been a controversial legal issue recently, especially in New Jersey. In October JURIST guest columnist Kathryn Young <a href="/dateline/2012/10/kathryn-young-nj-gambling.php">defended New Jersey's sports betting law</a> [JURIST comment], arguing that gambling can effectively increase states' revenue and should be viewed outside of its negative connotations. that  There is a presumptive prohibition on most forms of gambling in the US, although restrictions on some forms of Internet gambling were loosened late in 2011 when the Department of Justice (DOJ) clarified that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/doj-finds-online-non-sports-gambling-lawful.php">non-sports online gambling is presumptively legal</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2012 <a href="http://theppa.org/about/board/patrick-fleming/">Patrick Fleming</a> [advocacy profile], Litigation Support Director at <a href="http://theppa.org/">Poker Players Alliance</a> [advocacy website], argued that the decision <a href="/hotline/2012/01/patrick-fleming-online-gambling.php">bolstered the legitimacy of Internet betting</a> [JURIST comment], yet the gambling landscape remains a patchwork of many distinct standards and statutory definitions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In August a jury awarded Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung. Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the court must reduce the damages award by $450 million because she found that the jury calculated damages for 14 certain infringing Samsung products based on improper legal grounds. Koh also determined that it would be impossible to properly calculate the correct amount of damages under the jury's findings, and that a new trial would be necessary to formulate those damages: <blockquote>Because the Court has identified an impermissible legal theory on which the jury based its award, and cannot reasonably calculate the amount of excess while effectuating the intent of the jury, the Court hereby orders a new trial on damages ... This amounts to $450,514,650 being stricken from the jury's award.</blockquote>However, in her order Koh also encouraged Apple and Samsung to seek appellate review from the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] before holding a new trial.

<p>The reduction in damages is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. In December Judge Koh <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-overseeing-apple-samsung-lawsuits-requests-temporary-ceasefire.php">requested a temporary "ceasefire"</a> [JURIST report] in litigation while she determined whether or not to reduce the damages that Samsung owed to Apple. In October a judge for the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">issued a preliminary ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four of Apple's patents relating to smartphone design and touchscreen technology. Also in October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. Also in October, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/japan-reports-rejections-of-samsung-patent-infringement-claims-against-apple.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] patent infringement claims made by Samsung in Japan, overcoming Samsung's attempt to enjoin iPhone sales in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Violence between JI protesters and Bangladesh police <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/us-bangladesh-tribunal-idUSBRE91R0AN20130228">erupted</a> [Reuters report] on Thursday after the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-leader-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] JI leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sayedee">Delwar Hossain Sayeedee</a> [JURIST news archive]. Riots across the country have resulted in at least <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21639831">46 deaths</a> [BBC report], with hundreds wounded. HRW Asia director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/brad-adams">Brad Adams</a> [advocacy profile] stated:<blockquote>The leadership of Jamaat should immediately issue public statements to its followers to stop these violent, unacceptable attacks against law enforcement officers and those who support the verdicts of the war crimes trials. At the same time, the government should instruct the security forces to strictly observe its obligation to use maximum restraint and avoid lethal force unless necessary to protect their lives or those of others. If cool heads don't prevail, Dhaka could dissolve into uncontrolled violence.</blockquote>
Media reports indicate that most deaths were the result of police using live ammunition against protesters, but supporters of the current ruling party have also engaged in violence. JI has denied that any party members were responsible for lethal violence, but reports indicate that some members were responsible for attacks against Hindu temples and houses.

<p>Last month the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">Bangladesh parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-parliament-approves-amendments-to-war-crimes-law.php">approved amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the country's war crimes laws to allow prosecutors to appeal sentences given to defendants convicted of war crimes. These amendments are a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">response to protests</a> [JURIST report] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, another JI leader, was given a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War (BLW). The protesters believed a life sentence was too lenient and that Mollah, who was convicted of charges including murder, rape and torture, should have been given the death penalty. The law passed by parliament will be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladeshs-parliament-amends-war-crimes-law-18523564">effective retroactively</a> [AP report] to July 2009, allowing prosecutors to appeal Mollah's sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision by the Supreme Court Chamber of the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] will <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44264&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=#.UTJ3l44bZOd">allow acts of sexual violence to be included</a> [UN News Centre report] in the case against three former Khmer Rouge officials who have been charged with crimes against humanity and genocide. Nearly two million people are thought to have died under the Khmer Rouge regime. While she praised the EEEC decision, Bangura also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44267&Cr=Kenya&Cr1=#.UTI_V6Wsh8F">called on Kenyan authorities</a> [UN News Centre report] to ensure the protection of civilians during the presidential election to be held on Monday, especially to prevent a repeat of the outbreak of sexual violence that followed the disputed 2007 elections. Bangura noted that thousands of cases of rape and other forms of sexual assault were documented after the elections. Monday will see the first presidential election held in Kenya since the 2007 violence, in which over 1,100 people were killed. National and international observers have warned of the risk of violence following the coming election, including the deliberate targeting of civilians due to ethnic or political affiliations. Recent statements made by the presidential candidates indicate their commitment to a peaceful and tolerant campaign, appealing to their supporters to do the same.

<p>In February Kenyan presidential candidate <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090211/ICC01090111.htm">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [case materials] asked the <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] to postpone his trial for his involvement in the 2007 post-election violence. The trial is currently set to begin on April 11. Earlier last month Kenyatta and another ICC defendant, former civil service chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials], <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked the ICC to review its decision</a> [JURIST report] to move forward with the trial. In December the two Kenyans had <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that, despite their upcoming trials, they will be running together in Monday's election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/somalia-appeals-court-clears-woman-convicted-in-rape-case-that-drew-widespread-condemnation/2013/03/03/8246b166-83f8-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html">found the evidence insufficient</a> [AP report] to back the prosecutor's charge that led the woman to receive a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-court-sentences-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">one-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST reports]. While some medical evidence suggested  the woman was not raped, experts questioned the government's medical expertise in that determination. The journalist who interviewed the rape victim was also tried and originally sentenced to one year. Although the judge reduced the reporter's sentence to six months, the judge stated that the reporter had not respected the Somalia's laws or journalistic ethics. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/03/somalia-woman-alleging-rape-cleared-journalist-convicted">criticized the ruling</a> [press release], stating that the acquittal of the alleged victim and the upholding of the journalist's conviction would deter women from reporting crimes by government forces.

<p>The controversy surrounding this case has been a major concern for the fledgling Somali government. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] last Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">urged</a> the government of Somalia to reopen the case.

A collection of human rights groups and free press advocates also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rights-groups-unite-in-push-to-free-jailed-somali-journalist.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the release of Ibrahim and three others who were detained in connection with the woman's claims. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaints had <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130303/egypt-court-dismisses-challenge-charter-panel">challenged the method for selecting members</a> [AFP report] of the assembly and said the panel, which liberals and Christians had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report], did not represent all Egyptians. The charter was passed in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] in December. Opposition to the constitution argue that certain clauses favored Islamic law in Egypt, disadvantaging the large Christian minority in the country. The court continues to examine challenges against the constitutional assembly.

<p>Since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder], Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence. The Egyptian Shura Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">approved a draft election law</a> [JURIST report] in February, paving the way for parliamentary elections to be held in the next few months. The new election law embodies the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">key changes to five articles</a> [JURIST report] as demanded by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court earlier that month. Earlier last month the Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the legislative constitutional assembly that drafted the charter was legitimate. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming from ongoing protests throughout the country. Also in January Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> in an attempt to quell growing unrest and protests following an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Designation of the animal as threatened gives polar bears the lower of two levels of protection. This designation was challenged by both environmental groups, which argued that the polar bears should be considered endangered and be given the highest level of protections, and industry and sporting groups, which argued that they should not be protected under the act at all. The court determined that the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (FWS) [official website] used "reasoned decisionmaking" in deciding to list polar bears as threatened, and therefore did not disturb its designation. The agency went through a three-year rulemaking process and determined that, due to the effects of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=global+warming">global warming</a> [JURIST news archives], polar bears are likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future, warranting their designation as threatened.</p>

<p>Protection of polar bears has been a controversial issue with increasing awareness about global warming and other threats to polar bears' environment. In August a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-sides-with-oil-companies-in-animal-protection-suit.php">upheld a regulation</a> [JURIST report] by the FWS that provides legal protection to oil companies that incidentally cause harm to small numbers of walruses or polar bears. In 2011 a federal appeals court ruled that the FWS is <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-rules-government-not-required-to-reduce-emissions-to-protect-polar-bear.php">not obligated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</a> [JURIST report] to protect polar bears and their environment. That decision was made after the Obama administration in 2009 decided to keep a rule made during the presidency of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=george+w.+bush">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archives] that prevents the use of the ESA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to protect polar bears.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group of defendants includes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/uae-trial-coup-plot">unnamed doctors, academics, lawyers and other professionals</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] arrested over the past year and accused of forming a secret network with ties to the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] and designs to raise money in a plotted coup against the Emirati ruling families. International human rights groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/amnesty-international-trial-observer-denied-entry-uae-2013-03-03">press release</a>] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/02/uae-ensure-fair-trial-94-political-activists">press release</a>] have criticized the charges and raised concerns regarding the transparency and fairness of the trial. Most of the defendants are members of the conservative <a href="http://www.al-islah.net/">Reform and Social Guidance Association</a> (al-Islah) [advocacy website, in Arabic], a nonviolent Islamist political association advocating greater adherence to Islamic precepts. While approximately 200 relatives were bussed to the court in Abu Dhabi for the hearing, it was amid tight security and authorities barred international media and rights groups from attending. Even the road leading to the court was closed. Some of the defendants have been in detention for nearly a year but most were arrested in July and August. Rights groups, relatives of the detainees and the defendants themselves have made <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21628072">claims of mistreatment and torture</a> [BBC report] of some individuals while in custody. The UAE tolerates no political opposition within its borders.

<p>UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. In late April AI and HRW called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST report] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. In July prominent human rights lawyer and al-Islah member Mohammed al-Roken, along with his son and son-in-law, were all <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uae-arrests-prominent-lawyer-in-ongoing-crackdown-on-islamist-dissidents.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] just a few days after the arrest of another prominent human rights lawyer, Mohammed Mansoori. A month later Al-Roken and Mansoori <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/imprisoned-lawyers-in-uae-go-on-hunger-strike.php">began a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest their detentions. Both lawyers are reportedly among the 94 defendants now on trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This case marks the first time that Russia will carry out a <a href="http://my.news.yahoo.com/russia-resumes-hearings-against-dead-lawyer-074348766.html">legal proceeding</a> [AFP report] against a deceased person. During the hearing, the judge is expected to set a date to begin trial, after which a state-appointed lawyer will be appointed to defend Magnitsky. Magnitsky's family members and lawyers have refused to attend the trial and criticized the appointment of a defense lawyer, claiming that the charges are politically motivated. Magnitsky's death while in custody, after accusing state officials of tax fraud, has caused a rift in Russia's relationship with the US.

<p>Last month, the Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/moscow-court-orders-trial-of-deceased-russia-whistleblower.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Magnitsky's trial to begin in March. Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009, was a lawyer for the <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Fund</a> [corporate website] and was arrested in 2008 by <a href="http://eng.mvdrf.ru/">Russian Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in English] officials on suspicion of tax evasion after he accused the ministry of embezzling USD $230 million from the state. State prosecutors accuse Magnitsky and a former client of evading $16.8 million in taxes. In January a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/moscow-court-postpones-posthumous-hearing-for-russia-whistleblower.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the preliminary hearing for Magnitsky.

The report found that since 2007 Yemen executed at least 15 men and women who were under 18 at the time of their offense. HRW urged President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi to immediately reverse execution orders for three juvenile offenders currently on death row who have exhausted all appeals and could now face a firing squad. The report noted the failure of Yemen's judicial system to provide fair trials and legal safeguards for detainees, as well as reports and confessions of torture by police investigators to extract confessions. Also, Yemen has one of the lowest birth registration rates in the world, with only 22 percent of births between 2000-2010 reported. Thus, most juvenile offenders lack official birth certificates documenting their age. However, international law prohibits executing individuals for crimes committed before age 18. When courts cannot conclusively establish an offender's age when the alleged crime happened, international law indicates a death sentence cannot be imposed.

<p>Yemen is the fifth country in the world for the highest number of executions, and has been repeatedly accused of human rights violations. In February <a href="www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ai-yemen-forces-must-refrain-from-violent-crackdown-on-protests.php">called on Yemeni forces</a> [JURIST report] to observe peace and restraint during scheduled protest marches, but the security forces fired on protesters despite AI's plea. Also in February HRW said <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-yemen-failed-to-probe-anti-government-protester-deaths.php">Yemen authorities failed to investigate top officials</a> [JURIST report] in the shooting deaths of 45 anti-government demonstrators killed in the country's "Friday of Dignity Massacre" in March 2011. In December AI reported a series of gross human rights abuses committed by Yemen's government forces and al Qaeda affiliates during the 2011-2012 conflict over control of the country's southern region of Abyan. Amid fervent protests in April 2011, former president Ali Abdullah Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down from power</a> [JURIST report], ending his 32-year reign as the nation's leader, in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Earlier that month AI released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">urging the international community</a> [JURIST report] to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate the deaths of protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

After a <a href="<a href="http://mobile.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Czech_upper_house_votes_to_impeach_president_Klaus.html?cid=35137230">38 to 30 vote</a> [Reuters report], the Senate filed a complaint in the <a href="http://www.usoud.cz/clanek/internetcs">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Czech] averring that Klaus violated the constitution by refusing to appoint judges, refusing to ratify European treaties after adoption by the Senate and <a href="http://www.hrad.cz/cs/pro-media/tiskove-zpravy/7522.shtml">declaring a broad and controversial amnesty</a> [materials, in Czech] in January. According to media sources, Klaus <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/01/czech-politics">pardoned all convicts with prison sentences under a year</a> [<em>Economist</em> report], leading to the release of more than 6,000 prisoners, or one quarter of the nation's imprisoned. In addition, the amnesty declaration halted all criminal proceedings lasting longer than eight years, including several high-profile fraud and embezzlement cases allegedly arising out of Klaus' own economic reforms. After two months of contention, the Senate voted to impeach Klaus. The Constitutional Court has given the case top priority, but reports indicate that the proceeding will be predominantly ceremonial, as the highest potential penalty is removal from office, and Klaus' term ends on Thursday. The Czech Republic held its first ever direct presidential election in January. 

<p>Klaus' presidency has encountered controversy in the past, particularly over matters concerning treaty ratification. The Czech Republic was the last EU member state to ratify the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 2009, which sought to amend the treaties forming the constitutional basis of the European Union. In November 2009, Klaus <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/czech-president-signs-treaty-of-lisbon.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] after the country's Constitutional Court ruled that the treaty did not conflict with the country's constitution. Klaus maintained his position that the court's decision was political and that the treaty interfered with Czech sovereignty. The treaty had passed both the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/czech-lower-house-approves-eu-reform.php">lower</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/czech-republic-senate-ratifies-eu.php">upper</a> houses of the Czech Parliament in February and May 2009, but Klaus <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/czech-president-says-eu-proposal.php">sought an opt-out clause</a> [JURIST reports] that would shield the country from property claims by ethnic Germans who were expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-52_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] submitted to the UN Human Rights Council, there is evidence of the CIA operating clandestine detention facilities known as "black sites," in a number of countries including Lithuania, Morocco, Poland, Romania and Thailand. In addition, the report claims that the officials of at least 49 other nations allowed their airspace or airports to be used for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rendition">extraordinary renditions</a> [JURIST news archive] carried out by the CIA.The Special Rapporteur urged those countries accused of allowing CIA "black sites" "to establish (or where applicable, to re-open) effective independent judicial or quasi-judicial inquiries into credible allegations that secret CIA "black sites" were established on their territories." In January 2009 the Obama administration passed an executive order prohibiting the use of secret detention, torture and other forms of prisoner abuse.  

<p>The issue of CIA extraordinary rendition has been a sensitive one, particularly in Europe. In February a Milan appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/milan-court-convicts-italian-spy-chief-for-role-in-cias-extraordinary-rendition-program.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Niccolo Pollari, the former Italian spy chief, to 10 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping of a terror suspect as part of the CIA extraordinary rendition program. In the same month the <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/more-than-50-countries-participated-in-us-extraordinary-rendition-program-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] at least 54 countries participated in the CIA overseas detention and rendition of at least 136 people. In December the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/europe-rights-court-rules-for-victim-of-cia-extraordinary-rendition.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government of <a href="http://vlada.mk/?language=en-gb">Macedonia</a> [official website] is responsible for the torture and degrading maltreatment of a man the ECHR found to be an innocent victim of CIA extraordinary rendition in 2003. In September the <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Italian Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 23 former CIA officers for the 2003 kidnapping and rendition of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. In April Emmerson expressed regret over a US court decision denying <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/foia.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [National Security Archive] requests by a member of the UK parliament and the <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/">UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> [official website], made as part of an <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-counterterrorism-official-criticizes-us-court-decision-on-rendition-information.php">investigation into extrajudicial capture</a> [JURIST report] by the US of foreign terrorism suspects for detention and interrogation.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-574-2012-11-06-Walden-Cert-Pet-App.pdf">Walden v. Fiore</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-574.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider two questions of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/venue">venue</a> and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders]. First, the court will look at whether a court can exercise personal jurisdiction for a defendant to facilitate <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] when the only contact the plaintiff has in the jurisdiction is a connection to the state, of which the defendant has knowledge. The court will also consider if a court can establish venue under <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1391">28 USC &#167; 1391(b)(2)</a> [text] if "a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred" in a judicial district, but other alleged acts and omissions occurred in another. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Fiore+v.+Walden&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=18276508762489788028&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] that there was personal jurisdiction in the case. Gina Fiore and Keith Gipson were traveling to Nevada. They were searched in a layover in Atlanta, Georgia, where their money was seized as evidence of drug transactions. The money was actually legal gambling winnings, but Fiore and Gipson sued in Nevada, where they landed with no money, and claimed enough of the injury occurred there to grant venue and jurisdiction.

<p>The court on Monday denied <em>certiorari</em> in <A href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/PCDOCS-5096265-v1-Filed-Copy-of-Crawley-Writ-of-Certiorari.pdf">Crawley v. Minn</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-698.htm">docket</a>], which would have examined the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] implications of criminalizing criticism of the police in some situations. The Supreme Court of Minnesota <A href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/desktop/public/document/State_v_Crawley_819_NW2d_94_Minn_2012_Court_Opinion">upheld</a> [opinion] Minnesota statute <A href = "https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.505">&#167; 609.505 (2)</a> [text], which criminalizes falsely reporting police misconduct: "[w]hoever informs, or causes information to be communicated to, a peace officer, whose responsibilities include investigating or reporting police misconduct, that a peace officer ... committed an act of police misconduct, knowing that the information is false, is guilty of a crime." The court held that the law criminalizes defamation and is not in violation of the First Amendment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [JURIST report] that the intentional tort exception in the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/1089">Gonzales Act</a> [10 USC &#167; 1089 text] does not immunize individual government medical personnel against battery suits. Thus, instead of suing the entire government under the <A href = "http://bphc.hrsa.gov/ftca/">Federal Torts Claim Act</a> (FTCA) [official website], a plaintiff can sue the individual medical personnel who allegedly caused the injury. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court:<blockquote>Warding off this mistaken inference, the Government asserts, &#167;1089(e) eliminates any doubt that the military medical personnel covered by &#167;1089(a) are personally immune from malpractice liability. Ensuring that immunity, the Government reminds us, was the very purpose of the Gonzalez Act. 

<p>The choice between these alternative readings of &#167;1089(e) is not difficult to make. Section &#167;1089(e)'s operative clause states, in no uncertain terms, that the intentional tort exception to the FTCA, &#167;2680(h), "shall not apply," and &#167;1089(e)&#8217;s introductory clause confines the abrogation of &#167;2680(h) to medical personnel employed by the agencies listed in the Gonzalez Act.</p>

<p>The Government invites us to read the phrase "section 2680(h) . . . shall not apply," to convey "&#167;2680(h) does apply," a reading most unnatural.</blockquote>The court's decision overturns the <A href = "http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1586462.html">ruling</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>

<p>The court ruled in favor of Steven Alan Levin, who <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-adds-6-cases-reverses-west-virginia-redistricting-ruling.php">appealed to the court <em>pro se</em></a> [JURIST report] from the US territory of Guam. Levin, a Navy veteran, sued after he claimed that Navy surgeons performed cataract surgery on him without his consent. Levin, who has neither telephone nor Internet, has not commented on his victory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The injunction applies to two provisions of Arizona's <a href="www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">SB 1070</a> [text, PDF], which make it unlawful for a motor vehicle occupant to hire or attempt to hire a person for work at another location from a stopped car that impedes traffic, or for a person to be hired in such a manner. The appeals court held that although Arizona has a significant government interest in promoting traffic safety, the day laborer provisions failed the requirement set forth in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Central+Hudson+Gas+%26+Electric+Corp.+v.+Public+Service+Commission+of+New+York,+447+U.S.+557,+566+(1980)&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=1962482840967580827&scilh=0">Central Hudson Gas &#38; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York</a> [opinion] that restrictions on commercial speech be no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. 

<p>SB 1070 has gained notoriety for its controversial provision requiring law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In June the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arizona-v-united-states/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Arizona v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to strike down sections of the Arizona law, but upheld the controversial portion allowing police officers to check immigration status of anyone arrested. Currently, the Ninth Circuit is considering another questionable provision of the law that prohibits the harboring of "unlawful aliens." The harboring ban had been in effect since SB 1070's inception in July 2010 until it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-upholds-arizona-immigration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Arizona in September. Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website], who signed the bill into law, <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/arizona-to-appeal-federal-injunction-on-portion-of-state-immigration-law.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the lower court's injunction in late September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Founder and former chairman Sherkhan Farnood and former chief executive officer Khalilullah Ferozi were each <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/05/kabul-bank-chiefs-jailed-fraud">given five-year sentences</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and ordered to pay back USD $279 million and $531 million respectively. Although the prosecution brought money laundering and embezzlement charges warranting 20 years in prison, the former executives were actually convicted on the lesser charge of breach of trust through the misappropriation of funds. There are no provisions in the verdict for the government to seize property or funds should the money fail to be repaid. Fraud at the bank reportedly began in 2006, two years after its founding. Then the largest bank in Afghanistan, Kabul Bank's collapse in 2010 triggered a financial crisis that <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-afghanistan-kabulbankbre9240bu-20130305,0,2800810.story">threatened the entirety of the fragile Afghan economy</a> [Reuters report], and the government was forced to bail it out. The bank has since been relaunched as the state-run <a href="http://www.kabulbank.af/html/index.aspx">New Kabul Bank</a> [corporate website]. Farnood and Ferozi have indicated that they intend to appeal their sentences. The three-judge tribunal specifically created to prosecute the fraud deliberated for only ten minutes before returning its verdict. It appears to be the first major bank fraud trial in Afghan history.

<p>The five-year prison terms handed down over the Kabul Bank fraud have been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/afghan-tribunal-convicts-sentences-top-kabul-bank-executives-to-5-year-prison-terms/2013/03/05/380744dc-8568-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html">criticized as too lenient</a> [AP report]. By comparison, in the US the disgraced financier <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> in June 2009 to 150 years in prison after he <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty to 11 counts</a> [JURIST reports] of securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme believed to have defrauded investors of over $65 billion. While the $900 million fraud in Kabul pales in contrast to the multi-billion-dollar Madoff figures, the Kabul Bank collapse represented as much as five percent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, imperiling the nation's entire economy. Furthermore, the Afghan government is largely funded by foreign donors, many of whom may limit or cancel their financing should they perceive that the government is not adequately prosecuting fraud such as that at Kabul Bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nasheed had <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/03/20133510315699221.html">taken refuge</a> [Al Jazeera report] in the <a href="http://www.hcimaldives.in/">Indian High Commission in the Maldives</a> [official website] last month to avoid police detainment, but left the Commission 10 days before he was arrested. Nasheed became the first democratically-elected president of the Maldives in 2008 but <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">stepped down</a> last year following public protest over his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST reports] and senior criminal court Judge Abdulla Mohamed on charges of corruption. The former president and his supporters contend that his actions were legal and that he was forced from office by opposition protests and a police mutiny. If convicted of the charges against him, Nasheed could be barred from participating in the presidential election slated for September of this year. 

<p>A Maldives court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/maldives-court-issues-second-arrest-warrant-for-ex-president.php">issued a second arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Nasheed last month, which led to his arrest Tuesday. Nasheed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/maldives-ex-president-arrested-after-violating-court-imposed-travel-ban.php">also arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October for leaving the capital city of Male in contravention of a court summons and a court-imposed travel ban. Nasheed failed twice to appear in court to face abuse of power charges. Earlier in October a three-judge panel was forced to postpone the first day of Nasheed's trial after he <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/maldives-ex-president-violates-travel-ban-fails-to-appear-in-court.php">violated his travel ban</a> [JURIST report], leaving Male in a boat that day in order to campaign in the Maldives' southern islands. A week earlier, the Hulhumale Magistrate Court had issued an <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/maldives-court-restricts-ex-president-to-capital.php">order prohibiting Nasheed from leaving the city</a> [JURIST report] without official permission. Nasheed's supporters claimed that the move was politically motivated to limit the former president's ability to campaign for the upcoming election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Known as the <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/public/php/pdf_viewer.php?pdf=ftp://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/2013/Public/SB134.pdf">Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [SB 134, PDF], this bill was the most recent addition to a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arkansas+abortions">slew of recent Arkansas legislation</a> [JURIST news archive], including a ban on all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which was vetoed by Beebe last week and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">overridden</a> [JURIST report] by the legislature. Beebe said that he vetoed the 12-week ban for the reason that "(i)n short, because it would impose a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic abortion well before viability, Senate Bill 134 blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court." The bill would have been the most restrictive abortion law in the nation. Despite predictions that fewer members of the legislature are expected to support another override, the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already stated its <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jYkgFg6HiG0WXjd1iTcX67gDGgLg?docId=87e4cebdbf734011b73deaae30e63c81">intention to challenge</a> [AP report] SB 134 if enacted.

<p>Numerous states have changed their abortion laws recently to impose more restrictions on the availability of abortions, leading to several legal challenges. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation, which would have gone into effect in January. Montana voters in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure on the minor. Also that month, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Arkansas and Georgia's laws, bans abortions after 20 weeks. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's statement comes following four attacks on albinos over a 16-day period, including three children. Pillay called the attacks "abhorrent" and called upon local officials in Tanzania to do more to address the problem by prosecuting attacks on albinos, caring for the victims and educating people about using stereotypes, such as the belief that albinos have magical qualities. Tanzania rarely prosecutes those who perpetrate crime against albinos and of the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44279&Cr=tanzania&Cr1=#.UTYr_hmlJjO">72 murders of albinos since 2000</a> [UN News Centre report], only five have been prosecuted. 

<p>The treatment of albinos in Tanzania is one of many human rights issues that Pillay has addressed recently. Last week Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-recounts-challenges-advances-in-2012.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] an annual report outlining the "daunting" human rights crises that occurred in 2012, including armed conflicts in Syria, Palestine, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-international-community-must-continue-to-prevent-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to continue to prevent human rights abuses and hold perpetrators accountable. Speaking to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Pillay specifically mentioned the ongoing situations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Sudan and Syria. Also in February Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody are in poor health from hunger strikes protesting Israel's use of administrative detention. Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] criticizing Sri Lanka for failing to investigate widespread reports of killings and other atrocities during the 26-year civil war it fought with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The same month, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urged-comprehensive-approach-to-sexual-violence-in-south-africa.php">expressed shock and sadness</a> [JURIST report] concerning the brutal rape and murder of 17-year-old Anene Booysen in South Africa and urged the country to take a stronger approach to prevent sexual violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The project is under the management of <a href="http://www.endesa.com/en/home">Endesa</a> [corporate website], an energy company based in Spain. The suit was brought by local fishermen who <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130305/chile-court-halts-construction-massive-electric-plant">claimed</a> [AFP report] the dam project would have significant adverse environmental effects and would materially compomrise the fishing industry on which they rely for their livelihood. The project was expected to supply power to the region's expanding mining industry, and the resulting increased demand for electric power.

<p>Hydroelectric dam projects have received significant scrutiny from Chilean courts in recent years. In May the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.cl/">Supreme Court of Chile</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/chile-high-court-blocks-new-hydroelectric-dam-in-patagonia.php">issued a ruling</a> [JURIST report] preventing the construction of a new hydroelectric dam in Patagonia over environmental concerns. In April  the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/chile-high-court-rejects-challenge-to-hydroelectric-dam-project.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a hydroelectric dam in Patagonia by <a href="http://www.hidroaysen.cl/site/inicio.html">HidroAysen</a> [project website, in Spanish], a private Chilean venture, did not violate the constitutional rights of the environmental groups opposing the project. In June 2011 a Chilean appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/chile-court-orders-temporary-suspension-of-hydroelectric-dam-project.php">ordered the temporary suspension</a> [JURIST report] of the USD $10 billion HidroAysen project, approving three petitions challenging government authorization of the dam construction and granted the plaintiffs' petition for injunction. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/06/chile-energy-court-idUSN1E79519E20111006">lifted the temporary suspension</a> [Reuters report] in October 2011 allowing work on the project to move forward and spurring a constitutional challenge by environmentalists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The OHCHR discussed <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44283&Cr=conakry&Cr1=#.UTZdc6GDQXw">reports of injuries and death</a> [UN News Centre report] following demonstrations in the captial of Conakry. OHCHR spokesperson Rupert Colville said, "We call on national authorities to ensure the strict application of law and remind them of their responsibility to protect civilians. ... We also call for a prompt, impartial and effective investigation to ensure that those responsible for the human rights violations which have been committed are held accountable." The OHCHR also called on demonstrators to abstain from "using of violence and damaging property." 

<p>While the current incident may appear at first to be minor, Guinea has a history of unrest. In September <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on the Guinean government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-urges-support-for-guinea-massacre-investigation.php">further its support</a> [JURIST report] for the prosecution of crimes originating from a 2009 massacre. In 2010 a commission created by Guinea's junta announced that former Guinean junta aide Lieutenant Aboubacar Cherif "Toumba" Diakite is the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/guinea-commission-finds-former-junta.php">sole government official to blame for the massacre</a> [JURIST report]. The commission's conclusion contradicted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/un-report-finds-guinea-military-junta.php">UN report</a> [JURIST report] that blamed military junta leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], Minister for Special Services Moussa Tiegboro Camara and Toumba for the September 28 slayings. In October 2009 the International Criminal Court placed the Guinean military under <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/jmb-guinea-under-preliminary-icc.php">preliminary investigation</a> for human rights violations related to the Conakry incident, and the UN and Guinea both announced they were creating <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-sg-ban-establishes-committee-to.php">commissions to investigate</a> [JURIST reports] the killings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throughout the month, we&#8217;ll be (briefly) interrupting our regularly scheduled programming to ask you a simple question: how much is JURIST worth to you?</p>

<p>For as little as $10, you can show that you believe in JURIST, that you support unbiased news coverage, and that you encourage our ad-free, registration-free publication model. You can also become a sustaining member and show your support for JURIST every month. Just check the "recurring monthly donation" box on the donation form.</p>

<p>Getting down to brass tacks: <strong>we need your help</strong> to pursue our mission. JURIST is lucky to receive support from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. We are also lucky to receive substantial support from other non-profits who believe in our mission. In the end, however, we are in fact an independent non-profit and need to generate our own financial support. Like our public broadcasting colleagues at PBS and NPR, we believe that our audience is both our most important and most reliable source of funding.</p>

<p>We do what we do for you, our readers, and we are only able to do it with your support. If you value JURIST, <strong>please consider donating</strong> so that we can continue to bring you the substantive legal news and reasoned expert commentary that you've come to expect and enjoy.</p>

<p>You can read more at <a href="https://www.jurist.org/supportjurist">https://www.jurist.org/supportjurist</a>, or if you&#8217;re ready to join us, you can <a href="https://www.jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donate now</a>!</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report by Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders Margaret Sekaggya <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13075&LangID=E">claims</a> [press release] that rights advocates and groups can be a "vital actor in the fight against impunity for human rights violations" and that they should be "supported by public authorities and protected if needed." Sekagga found that nations often undermine the efforts of those rights defenders through "laws and administrative provisions to unduly restrict the work of human rights defenders." In her <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44292&Cr=human+rights&Cr1=#.UTd0AdaKK8A"?>presentation</a> [UN News Centre report] to the UNHRC, Sekaggya suggested nations are undermining the efforts of those trying to campaign for human rights claiming:<blockquote>From anti-terrorism and other legislation relating to public security to legislation governing registration, functioning and funding of associations, from defamation and blasphemy legislation to legislation relating to public morals, States are using laws and administrative provisions to unduly restrict the work of human rights defenders.</blockquote>The report concludes with recommendations for the "bare minimum" states should to protect rights defenders, including creating a specific legal recognition of those advocating for human rights, establishing programs to help protect rights defenders, and a legal autonomy for those defenders so that they may "investigate all allegations of violations by all branches of the State and all types of actors, including armed forces and private businesses."

<p>The UNHRC has recently addressed a variety of human rights abuses around the world. In February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-international-community-must-continue-to-prevent-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to continue to prevent human rights abuses and hold perpetrators accountable. Speaking at the opening of the 22nd session of the UNHRC in Geneva, Pillay specifically mentioned the ongoing situations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan and Syria. Also in February, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody are in poor health from hunger strikes protesting Israel's use of administrative detention. In the same timeframe, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">unveiled a report</a> [JURIST report] criticizing Sri Lanka for failing to investigate widespread reports of killings and other atrocities during the latter days of the nation's 26-year civil war it fought with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Also in February, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urged-comprehensive-approach-to-sexual-violence-in-south-africa.php">expressed shock and sadness</a> [JURIST report] concerning the brutal rape and murder of 17-year-old Anene Booysen in South Africa. Pillay urged South Africa to take a stronger approach to prevent the ongoing sexual violence incidents against tens of thousands of South African women every year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The call for debate was based upon a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released in February that detailed the abuses and mistreatment and the policies promoting those practices as well as existing protection gaps. The report illuminated often undetected practices and emphasizes how certain treatments violate prohibitions on torture and ill-treatment. Mendez spoke of unique challenges to correcting such practices due to a "perception that, while never justified, certain practices in health-care may be defended by the authorities on grounds of administrative efficiency, behaviour modification or medical necessity." Mendez recognized forms of abuses including: compulsory detention for drug users, street children, homeless individuals, and others in rehabilitation centers run by military or police; violation of reproductive rights such as involuntary sterilization, female genital mutilation, and denial of abortion or post-abortion care; denial of pain treatment; solitary confinement and prolonged restraint of persons with psychosocial disabilities; and denial of treatment to HIV/AIDS patients and  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.

<p>Mendez has traveled around the world to report on the use of torture. In September Mendez said that the human rights situation in Morocco was improving but that <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-morocco-must-work-to-eradicate-torture.php">more effort was needed to eradicate torture</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month he called on the Egyptian government and courts to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-urges-egypt-to-ban-use-of-evidence-obtained-through-torture.php">stop permitting evidence acquired through torture</a> [JURIST report] to be admitted in any legal proceedings including military trials. In May Mendez made a nine-day visit to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16201032">Republic of Tajikistan</a> [BBC profile], where he praised that country's effort to modify its criminal justice system designed to aid in <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-human-rights-official-urges-greater-efforts-to-eliminate-torture-in-tajikistan.php">eradicating torture</a> [JURIST report], but he also found that mistreatment of suspects remains the norm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though dismissing the potential for such as strike as being "unlikely to occur" Holder <a href="http://rt.com/usa/white-house-lethal-force-878/">suggested</a> [Reuters report] that in a situation similar to the attack on Pearl Harbor or that of 9/11 it could be conceivable that the president would be forced to use drones to attack Americans domestically in an effort to "protect the homeland." The letter to Rand was a response to a recent threat by the Republican Senator to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan for CIA director until the president "answers the question of whether or not the President can kill American citizens through the drone strike program on US soil." Brennan was approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday but must still win approval of the full Senate. 

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under scrutiny in recent months. In January UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">begin investigating the legality</a> [JURIST report] of the use of drone strikes. Emmerson said that after asking the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of its use of targeted killings last year, there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct. Also in January Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php">condemned US drone attacks</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. In December the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. In July Pakistan's Ambassador to the US called upon the US to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of using drone strikes in targeted killings. That same month US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of drone strikes. <a href="http://www.nnklaw.com/attorney-profiles/samar-warsi">Samar Warsi</a> [corporate profile] of the Muslim Civil Liberties Union recently argued that Obama administration's drone policy <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">sets a dangerous precedent</a> [JURIST comment] and undermines national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf had survived two assassination attempts in December 2003, but civilians and police officers <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/musharraf-attack-pakistani-court-cancels-death-penalty/article4481719.ece">perished in the attacks</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report]. A military court had originally given a life sentence to Naveed and a 20-year jail term to Sohail, but the army appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/pakistani-court-sentences-4-to-death.php">converted those rulings to death sentences</a> [JURIST report] in 2005. 

<p>Musharraf has been a controversial figure in Pakistan. Pakistan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] in February 2012 to arrest Musharraf for his alleged involvement in the assassination of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Bhutto was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassinated</a> in 2007 in a suicide attack at a rally in Rawalpindi after she <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/pakistan-ex-pm-returns-from-exile.php">returned from her exile</a> [JURIST reports] in Great Britain and Dubai. In November 2011, an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/7-pakistanis-indicted-in-bhutto-assassination.php">indicted seven people</a> [JURIST report] in the assassination of the former prime minister. At that time, Musharraf was not charged despite allegations that he played a part in the assassination. However, his property was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">seized</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/">Federal Investigation Agency</a> (FIA) [official website] after an order rendered by Pakistani Judge Shahid Raffique due to Musharraf's failure to respond to multiple subpoenas. Those documents were issued because the FIA <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf in the assassination of Bhutto.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Michelle Bachelet, the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women</a> [official website], in a <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/parliamentary-strategies-for-tackling-violence-against-women-and-girls-speech-by-michelle-bachelet-5-march-2013/">speech to the legislators</a> [transcript] called for gender equality and an end to violence against women:<blockquote>In the aftermath of highly public tragedies over the past year, women, men and young people have raised their voices in a singular cry: enough is enough. People demand an end to impunity and insist on the protection of the rights of women and girls to live lives free of violence. And they do this because we are at this tipping point of deeper social transformation where indeed, and this is my biggest hope, gender equality becomes reality for all.</blockquote>Bachelet praised the nations that have already criminalized domestic violence, but pressed the legislators to enact laws penalizing violence against women. At the same event, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon</a> [official websites] echoed Bachelet's sentiments in a <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6632">speech</a> [transcript] that condemned impunity and called for laws that empower women.

<p>Violence against women has been a long-standing issue around the world. Last month Bachelet <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-womens-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-rising-violence-against-women-in-egypt.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] rising violence against women in Egypt. In January Ban <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-sg-calls-for-reform-to-protect-women-in-india.php">urged India's government</a> [JURIST report] to strengthen critical services for rape victims, expressing sympathy for the family of the 23-year-old medical student who died from injuries sustained in a gang-rape in December. Police in New Delhi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">charged six men</a> [JURIST report] with rape and murder of the woman. In December the UN released a report declaring that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">women in Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] are still suffering abuse at the hands of men. In November the UN urged countries to implement policies that will <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-urges-international-effort-to-end-violence-against-women.php">end violence against women</a> [JURIST report]. Also in November the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly approved a resolution calling for a global <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">ban on female genital mutilation</a> [JURIST report]. At the same time, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report detailing violence and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hrw-colombia-women-facing-obstacles-to-health-care-legal-remedies.php">obstacles women are facing in Colombia</a> [JURIST report], where the legal framework is often not properly applied despite the government's progress in enacting legislation to protect violence against women. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report claims approximately 700 Palestinian children are detained every year in Israeli military facilities. Further, UNICEF suggests mistreatment of these children in these facilities is "widespread, systematic and institutionalized." According to the report, the mistreatment includes:<blockquote>The arrests of children at their homes between midnight and 5:00 am by heavily armed soldiers; the practice of blindfolding children and tying their hands with plastic ties; physical and verbal abuse during transfer to an interrogation site, including the use of painful restraints; lack of access to water, food, toilet facilities and medical care; interrogation using physical violence and threats; coerced confessions; and lack of access to lawyers or family members during interrogation.</blockquote>UNICEF argues this treatment is inconsistent with Israel's international obligations under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text]. The report recommends Israel come into compliance with these obligations by integrating several steps in their detention practices. Notably, UNICEF called on Israel to only arrest children during daylight hours, use strip searches with extreme caution, allow children access to their family and a lawyer during interrogations, access to medical care and releasing the location of the children to the family. Further, the UNICEF urged the Israeli military to use these detention only as a last resort and only keep these children in detention for as long as is absolutely necessary. 

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-israel-airstrikes-in-gaza-violated-laws-of-war-killed-civilians.php">called</a> [JURIST report] Israeli airstrikes in Gaza a violation of the laws of war. In January UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-human-rights-experts-conclude-israel-settlements-violate-human-rights.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] Israeli settlements violate human rights. Last December <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/PSIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">pressured Israel</a> [JURIST report] to avoid targeting civilian structures in Gaza, expressing acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilian deaths that month. Also, last July, a UN committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-israel-treatment-of-child-detainees.php">raised</a> [JURIST report] similar concerns over children detainees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's decision is said to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-egypt-elections-court-idUSBRE9250S320130306">based on technical grounds</a> [Reuters report], namely that the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament, failed to return the amended electoral law to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report].

Notable changes include officers not being allowed to change their political party once they are elected, one third of the lower house being reserved for independents, and members of the former National Democratic Party (NDP) being barred from participating in politics for ten years. Opposition leaders, who threatened to boycott the elections scheduled by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>], welcomed the ruling. Morsi, however, will seek appeal on grounds that such sovereign acts should not be overturned. 

<p>Since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder], Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil, protests, and violence. Earlier this week, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution. Specifically, the complaints challenged the method for selecting the assembly's members, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report] by liberals and Christians as a misrepresentation of all Egyptians. Last month the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the assembly was legitimate. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll stemming from the country's ongoing protests. Also that month Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in cities brought on by an Egyptian court ruling handing down <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">21 death sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for a 2012 soccer riot that resulted in 74 deaths and thousands of injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=e0c4315749c10b084028087a4aa80a73">hearing</a> [materials] before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">US Senate Committee on the Judiciary</a> [official website], Holder requested that Congress consider universal background checks, banning high-capacity magazines and military style weapons. He also suggested passing tougher penalties for weapons trafficking. Holder is echoing President Barack Obama's and Vice President Joe Biden's calls for "common-sense" measures of restricting access to guns in order to prevent further gun violence. He also called upon the Senate to confirm Todd Jones as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

<p>Gun control has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The constitutionality of an assault weapons ban was recently <a href="/forum/2013/02/nicholas-johnson-gun-control.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] by JURIST guest columnist Nicholas Johnson of the Fordham University School of Law. Earlier this month, the Maryland Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make it harder to get a gun license. In mid-January, on the one-month anniversary of the Newtown shooting, Obama announced his signing of 23 executive <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws, as well as urging Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. The previous day New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to impose tighter restrictions on gun and ammunition sales, banning any magazine that can hold more than seven rounds and implementing instant background checks on all ammunition purchases at the time of sale.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA) announced that it has asked the ICC to <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/66189/World/International/Tuareg-rebels-ask-ICC-to-probe-Mali-army-crimes.aspx">investigate</a> [AFP report] the alleged use of torture, summary executions and forced disappearances while attempting to put down the rebellion. The MNLA was initially aligned with Islamists, but the two groups fell into conflict after the Islamists began imposing Sharia Law throughout the region. The Malian government has been accused of committing war crimes against people perceived to be collaborating with the Islamist rebels, including the Tuareg. France announced on Tuesday that <a href="http://www.afp.com/en/node/850392">dozens of Islamist rebels have been killed</a> [AFP report] during the conflict, and Chad claims that they killed one of the rebels' major commanders, Mokhtar Belmokhtar. An official for Isamist militant organization al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb also announced on Monday that another prominent militant, Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, was killed in a French bombing raid in northern Mali. France has deemed both of these reports to be unconfirmed at this point in order to avoid the appearance of celebration and protect the remaining French hostages in Mali.

<p>The Malian government allegedly denies knowledge of these acts of violence targeting particular ethnic groups amidst scrutiny from international sources. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the Malian government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mali-should-prosecute-soldiers-for-abuses-hrw.php">prosecute soldiers</a> [JURIST report] who participate in violence toward suspected Islamist rebels and supporters. Earlier that month the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] confirmed sending a four-person team to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-sends-team-to-investigate-human-rights-violations-in-mali.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] the claims of violence. ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-opens-investigation-into-mali-war-crimes.php">announced an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes in January. In July six West African nations <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/west-african-leaders-urge-icc-to-investigate-mali-war-crimes.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] for an ICC investigation into war crimes in Mali.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill will now pass to the Maryland House of Delegates and, if approved, to O'Malley to be signed into law. With the repeal, Maryland would become the eighteenth US state to abolish capital punishment.

<p>O'Malley announced in January that he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/maryland-governor-to-introduce-death-penalty-repeal-legislation.php">file legislation to repeal capital punishment</a> [JURIST report] in Maryland, stating that the death penalty is expensive and ineffective.

The letter alleged that "camp authorities have been confiscating detainees' personal items, including blankets, sheets, towels, mats, razors, toothbrushes, books, family photos, religious CDs, and letters, including legal mail; and restricting their exercise, seemingly without provocation or cause." They further allege that searches of their Korans have been conducted in a desecrating manner. As a result of these and other practices, the detainees have begun to protest, including through a hunger strike which is in its third week. The letter indicates that some of the detainees are suffering health consequences as a result of the protests. The lawyers called on Smith, the commanding officer of the facility, to address the concerns listed and to respond with a description of the policy changes. The lawyers learned of these practices and protests after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">permitted to visit</a> [JURIST report] the detention center by a judge in February.

<p>The procedures and policies regarding the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] military commission hearings have faced significant scrutiny. In February lawyers for the US Navy <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-lawyers-say-surveillance-devices-did-not-breach-detainee-attorney-client-privileges.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that surveillance equipment deployed throughout the Guantanamo Bay detention center was not used to breach attorney-client privilege.

In December the Oklahoma Supreme Court held <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110813.html">HB 2780</a> and <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110765.html">HB 1970</a> [opinions] to be <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], finding that the laws infringed upon women's constitutional reproductive rights and interfered with doctor's abilities to provide safe and efficacious treatment to patients, including prescribing an "off-label" use of drugs known to have abortion-inducing effects. In his petition, Pruitt attacked the Oklahoma Supreme Court's interpretation of the US Supreme Court's precedents in abortion cases. Pruitt wrote:<blockquote><em>Casey</em> reaffirmed the central holding in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> ... that a woman has a right to an abortion "before viability ... without undue interference from the State," but it also re-affirmed states' "legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child." ... Properly interpreted, then,  Casey dictates the opposite result reached in the decision below: laws like Oklahoma's medical abortion regulation are permissible. ... By failing to conduct the analysis <em>Casey</em> requires the Oklahoma Supreme Court perverted part of the "essential holding" of <em>Roe</em>.</blockquote>Pruitt also asserted that the Oklahoma laws did not ban the use of abortion inducing drugs, but merely ensured proper procedures for their use would be followed.

<p>Oklahoma has been at the center of controversy recently regarding <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The Oklahoma law restricting the use of abortion-inducing drugs was scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2011, but was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/oklahoma-judge-blocks-new-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pills.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in October. In April 2011 Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks. The law allows abortions past the 20-week mark only in certain extenuating circumstances where the mother faces death or serious injury. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but the woman undergoing the procedure would not face a penalty. Last year an Oklahoma state judge extended a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking enforcement of HB 2780.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/newsroom/index.php?do:newsDetail=1&news_id=3800">letter</a> [official statement] accompanying his <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-governor-vetoes-12-week-abortion-ban.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] of the 12-week ban, Beebe said he decided to attempt to block the bill because he believes it "blatantly contradicts the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court." Both the <a href="http://www.arkansas.gov/senate/">Arkansas Senate</a> and <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">House of Representatives</a> [official websites] voted to override the veto, giving Arkansas the most restrictive abortion laws in the US. The Act provides exemptions for instances of rape, incest, major fetal conditions and when the mother's life is in danger. Doctors who perform abortions in violation of the Act are to have their licenses revoked. Pro-choice advocates, such as <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [official website], called Wednesday "truly ... a sad day for Arkansas women," and <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/sad-day-arkansas-women-41039.htm">promised</a> [press release] to "continue to fight these bills and stand up women in Arkansas."

<p>Wednesday's vote comes only six days after lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">voted to override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Berlusconi's sentence stems from his conviction of publishing the transcript of a tapped phone conversation in <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/">Il Giornale</a> [media website], a national newspaper owned by his brother Paolo. The conversation in question took place between Berlusconi's biggest political rival at the time, <a href="http://www.pierofassinosindaco.it/default.aspx">Piero Fassino</a> [official website, in Italian], and the head of <a href="http://www.unipol.it/Pagine/default.aspx">Unipol</a> [corporate website, in Italian], an insurance company that has since been restructured. The publication broke secrecy rules, as the conversation should have remained private due to the ongoing investigation into possible inappropriate interference in Unipol's attempt to take over Italian banking firm <a href="http://www.bnl.it/HP/">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</a> (BNL) [official website, in Italian]. The publication was widely viewed as an attempt by the former prime minister to damage Fassino and other center-left opponents. While Fassino was awarded 80,000 euros in damages, Berlusconi, whose center-right political formation threw the country into <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/italy-elections-bersani_n_2787994.html">governmental chaos</a> [Reuters report] after emerging as the second strongest in parliament in last week's Italian elections, will not be required to serve any jail time until he has exhausted the appeals process. Berlusconi <a href="http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/03/07/news/bnl-unipol_un_anno_a_berlusconi-54037950/?ref=HRER2-1">continues to deny</a> [<em>La Repubblica</em> report, in Italian] a connection to any wrongdoing and considers his charges the work of political opposition and judicial persecution.

<p>Also on Wednesday the <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Supreme Court of Italy</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/italy-berlusconi-trial-idUSL6N0BZ77420130307">upheld a ruling</a> [Reuters report] clearing Berlusconi of tax fraud charges in connection with <a href="http://www.mediatradeservices.it/">Mediatrade</a>, the broadcast rights unit of his <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/">Mediaset</a> [corporate websites, in Italian] corporation. However, he remains a defendant in several other cases. In January a Milan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/milan-court-sets-berlusconi-sex-trial-verdict-for-after-february-elections.php">set a timetable</a> [JURIST report] for hearings in the former prime minister's underage sex trial, setting the last session of the trial for early March. There, Berlusconi is <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with paying then 17-year-old dancer Karima "Ruby" El Mahroug for sex and abusing his power by asking police to release her after she was detained for an unrelated theft crime. Also that month, Milan judges <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/italy-court-rejects-berlusconis-request-to-suspend-trial-until-after-election.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi's appeal to postpone his tax fraud trial until after the national elections. In January 2011, however, the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Constitutional Court of Italy</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede_v3/Ddliter/34882.htm">law</a> [materials, in Italian] backed by Berlusconi granting the premier and  and other public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office. Despite numerous trials, Berlusconi has never actually served prison time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit involved three patents in connection to data and information transfer technology that Samsung alleged Apple infringed. The technology allows transfers of information over the third-generation networks that are used by smartphones. In Thursday's ruling, Judge Christopher Floyd <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-07/apple-wins-in-samsung-u-k-essential-patent-claim-trial.html">invalidated</a> [Bloomberg report] Samsung's patents. Apple had argued that the patents at issue were invalid and that Samsung was required to license the patents under fair terms they were essential in allowing connection to third-generation networks. It is unclear whether Samsung will appeal the recent decision.

<p>Samsung and Apple have been involved in patent disputes around the globe. Earlier this month a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-reduces-damages-award-that-samsung-must-pay-apple.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] the amount of damages that Samsung is required to pay for infringing Apple patents. In January Koh ruled that Samsung did <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-finds-that-samsungs-infringement-of-apple-patents-was-not-willful.php">not willfully infringe</a> Apple's patents partially abrogating the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">jury verdict</a> [JURIST reports]. However, Koh declined to overturn the jury's findings on validity and infringement and also refused to grant Samsung a new trial on grounds that the trial was allegedly manifestly unfair. Last month the Tokyo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/japan-court-rejects-samsungs-patent-claim-against-apple.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a patent infringement claim brought by Samsung alleging that Apple stole its data transmission technology. In August the same court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-court-dismissed-apple-patent-suit-against-samsung.php">dismissed Apple's claim</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung holding that latter did not violate Apple's patents of synchronizing music and video data. An <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appeal followed</a> [JURIST report] two months later. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was <a href="http://newyork.newsday.com/news/region-state/fracking-moratorium-approved-by-ny-state-assembly-1.4767036">passed</a> [AP report] by a margin of 95 to 40 and would postpone any potential fracking until May 15, 2015, by which time a "comprehensive health impact assessment" can be conducted to identify potential public health impacts that may result from the process. The ban represents a continuation of a previous ban on fracking that has been in place in the state since 2008. State Assembly Speaker and co-sponsor of the bill, Sheldon Silver, laid out his case for the moratorium when he <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/Press/20130306a/">announced the legislation</a> [official statement], reasoning that "the health and well-being of the people must always take precedence over industry profits" and that "the natural gas locked within the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale isn't going anywhere."

<p>Fracking has been a contentious issue in the US recently. Earlier this month JURIST guest columnist Nicolas Parke <a href="/dateline/2013/03/nicolas-parke-fracking-regulation.php">debunked the rumors</a> [JURIST op-ed] around fracking. In February JURIST guest columnist Samantha Peaslee detailed the <a href="/dateline/2013/02/samantha-peaslee-home-rule-fracking.php">future of fracking</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Colorado in the wake of recent lawsuits against fracking companies in the state. In September Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection and Public Utility Commission filed a brief arguing that a recent Pennsylvania court decision which struck down portions of a law allowing the state to determine where fracking could occur <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-agencies-submit-brief-in-shale-drilling-law-appeal.php">was an error</a> [JURIST report]. In July North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue vetoed a <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/billlookup/billlookup.pl?Session=2011&BillID=S820">bill</a> [SB 820 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-bill-to-allow-fracking.php">report</a>] that would have lifted the state's ban on fracking. Last May Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/vermont-becomes-first-state-to-outlaw-fracking.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill outlawing fracking in the state. Last January the New Jersey Legislature passed an amendment to a bill that establishes a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/new-jersey-legislature-passes-one-year-fracking-ban.php">one-year ban on fracking</a> [JURIST report]. Legislators re-introduced the bill last year after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie conditionally vetoed legislation in June 2011 that would have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-jersey-legislature-passes-ban-on-shale-gas-fracking.php">permanently banned fracking in New Jersey</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2011 the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/epa-announces-plan-to-develop-standards-for-fracking-wastewater-discharge.php">announced plans to develop standards</a> [JURIST report] for wastewater discharge from fracking. June 2011 New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-ag-sues-us-government-for-failure-to-study-fracking-impact.php">sued the US government</a> [JURIST report] for its alleged failure to study the risks of fracking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Poland had claimed that the law was inequitable in its effect as it failed to take into consideration the energy portfolio of each of the individual member states when it created its carbon-efficiency benchmarks. The ETS is a cap-and-trade system which many feel has the potential to create an economic hardship on the eastern European nation which is largely reliant on carbon-heavy coal as an energy source. In <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/eu-carbon-court-idUSL6N0BZ3GJ20130307">denying</a> [Reuters report] the Polish claim, the court recognized the potential to harm those eastern nations which are largely dependent on coal but did not determine that impact was the result of an inequitable enforcement of the law.

<p>The EU's cap-and-trade system model of limiting carbon output has created controversy both in and out of Europe. In December 2011 the EU's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/top-eu-court-upholds-airline-pollution-fines.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] carbon-dependent fines against airlines for emissions. Enforcement of penalties against airlines <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-to-enforce-aircraft-emissions-law-despite-us-opposition.php">began</a> in 2012 after the scheme was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-court-advisor-supports-pollution-fines-against-foreign-airlines.php">upheld</a> by a lower EU court despite claims by the US which alleged that the scheme <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/us-says-eu-carbon-emissions-plan.php">violated international treaty</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, called the <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1165.pdf">Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">report</a>], was based on disputed medical evidence suggesting that a fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks and only permitted abortions after that time period when the mother's life was at risk. Linn McCormack was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/idaho-woman-challenges-state-anti-abortion-laws.php">prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] under the law in 2011 for using a combination of FDA-approved abortion pills obtained over the Internet resulting in termination of her pregnancy after the 20-week period allowed by the law. McCormick challenged the law's constitutionality, ultimately resulting in Wednesday's decision. In her opinion, Winmill struck down the law as placing an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion and as unconstitutionally vague in its criminal sanctions. Wednesday's decision is the first time a court has struck down a fetal-pain law <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/07/us-usa-abortion-idaho-idUSBRE92603L20130307">on its merits</a> [Reuters report]. 

<p>Over the past several years, state legislatures across the country have been implementing measures affecting abortion rights, prompting legal challenges in many instances. On Wednesday the Arkansas State legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto of the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks. Last month the Alabama House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-tightening-regulation-of-abortion-clinics.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] tightening regulations for abortion clinics, which critics maintain will result in the closure of many abortion clinics in the state. In January the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-massachusetts-abortion-clinic-buffer-zone.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Massachusetts law that established "buffer zones" for abortion clinics, which prohibits protesting within 35 feet of an abortion facility. Also in January a federal judge in Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-orders-trial-for-kansas-abortion-law-challenge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a trial for a challenge to a state law prohibiting insurance companies from covering abortions.

He is accused of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March13/GhaythAbuArrestPR.php">plotting to kill Americans</a> [press release]. Assistant Attorney General Lisa Monaco said, "The arrest of Abu Ghayth is an important milestone in our ongoing counterterrorism efforts. I applaud the many agents, analysts and prosecutors responsible for bringing about this significant case and arrest." Abu Ghaith once served as a spokesperson for al Qaeda. Although he is not accused of involvement in the September 11 attacks, he did <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/middleeast/bin-laden-son-in-law-is-being-held-in-a-new-york-jail.html?_r=0">defend the attacks</a> [NYT report] in statements to Al Jazeera. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos said:<blockquote>Abu Ghaith held a key position in al Qaeda, comparable to the consigliere in a mob family or propaganda minister in a totalitarian regime. He used his position to persuade others to swear loyalty to al Qaeda's murderous cause. He used his position to threaten the United States and incite its enemies. His apprehension is another important step in the campaign to limit the reach of al Qaeda and enhance our national and international security.</blockquote>Abu Ghaith's capture reportedly occurred when he was transiting through Jordan while traveling from Turkey to his native country Kuwait. 

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda operatives are making their way through the US judicial system. In January, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">vacated the conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, the media secretary of Osama bin Laden. In October, Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri on <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges. His charges include taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, and conspiring do such acts. He made his first appearance in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on after being extradited from the UK. Osama Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] by US military personnel in 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The VAWA, originally passed in 1994, provides legal assistance, counseling and other resources for victims of rape and domestic abuse. The law expired in 2011. The updated VAWA includes <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-signs-a-strengthened-violence-against-women-act/2013/03/07/e50d585e-8740-11e2-98a3-b3db6b9ac586_story.html">new protections for gays, lesbians and Native Americans</a> [WP report]. In his remarks accompanying the bill signing, Obama underscored the VAWA's importance in aiding victims of sexual violence:<blockquote>[O]ne of the great legacies of this law is that it didn't just change the rules; it changed our culture. It empowered people to start speaking out. It made it okay for us, as a society, to talk about domestic abuse. It made it possible for us, as a country, to address the problem in a real and meaningful way. And it made clear to victims that they were not alone&#8212;that they always had a place to go and they always had people on their side.</blockquote>The bill reauthorizes the VAWA for five years. 

<p>Since its expiration in 2011, the reauthorization of the VAWA has been controversial. Last week the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-house-reauthorizes-violence-against-women-act.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the VAWA by a vote of 286-138. The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the same version of the bill earlier in February. House Republicans initially sought to pass a version of the bill that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/politics/congress-passes-reauthorization-of-violence-against-women-act.html?_r=0">excluded specific protections</a> [NYT report] for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender victims of domestic violence. Last month UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13012&LangID=E">urged</a> [UN press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-us-congress-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.php">report</a>] the US Congress to renew the VAWA. In 2011 Manjoo <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.26.Add.5_AEV.pdf">issued a report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">report</a>] which found a continued prevalence of violence against women and discriminatory treatment of women in the US, with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. Last year the Republican-led House and the Democratic-controlled Senate both passed versions of the VAWA reauthorization but were <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/senate-renews-violence-women-act-article-1.1262231">unable to reach a compromise</a> [AP report] over the prosecutorial power of tribal courts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith appeared before Judge Lewis Kaplan, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/nyregion/sulaiman-abu-ghaith-bin-ladens-son-in-law-charged-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">briefly answering questions</a> [NYT report] during his 20-minute arraignment. The indictment alleges that Abu Ghaith, who served as a former spokesman for al Qaeda, worked closely with Bin Laden. In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March13/GhaythAbuArrestPR.php">statement</a> [press release] made prior to Abu Ghaith's court appearance on Friday, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] stated:<blockquote>No amount of distance or time will weaken our resolve to bring America's enemies to justice. To violent extremists who threaten the American people and seek to undermine our way of life, this arrest sends an unmistakable message: There is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice because we will do everything in our power to hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law.</blockquote>Abu Ghaith's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">capture</a> [JURIST report] reportedly occurred in Jordan while traveling from Turkey to his native Kuwait.

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda operatives are making their way through the US judicial system. In January the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">vacated the conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, the media secretary of Osama bin Laden. In October Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri on <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges. His charges include taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, and conspiring to do such acts. He made his first appearance in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York after being extradited from the UK. Osama Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] by US military personnel in 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a statement recognizing International Women's Day, experts praised the progress women and governments have achieved to further women's rights, but cautioned that violence against women remains a serious problem throughout the world. In efforts to ensure the dignity and safety of females around the world, experts encouraged governments to make an effort to implement the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm">UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</a> (CEDAW) [official website] in the <a href="http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CEDAW-Text.pdf">CEDAW Convention</a> [text]. The experts' statement noted that discrimination against women remains a problem in all parts of the world: <blockquote>Women disproportionately bear the brunt of poverty, war, disease, lack of safe water, and famine. Women living in rural areas and women suffering multiple forms of discrimination because of the intersections of their different identities and characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, migration status, social origin, gender identity and others, remain the most marginalized from development and human rights gains...We, therefore, call on Member States to heed the voices of all women and girls demanding with ever stronger insistence and urgency their human rights. This is now urgent for implementing their rights. We are simply the echo of their voices.</blockquote> The statement was joined by the CEDAW committee as well as a number of independent rights experts and other UN rights officials.

<p>The implementation of women's rights and protection has been an ongoing process around the world. Earlier this month, the UN top women's rights advocate <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-womens-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-rising-violence-against-women-in-egypt.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] escalating violence against women in Egypt. In January, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-sg-calls-for-reform-to-protect-women-in-india.php">urged India's government </a>[JURIST report] to strengthen critical services for rape victims, expressing sympathy for the family of the 23-year-old medical student who died from injuries sustained in a gang-rape in December. Police in New Delhi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-death-of-gang-rape-victim.php">charged six men</a> [JURIST report] with rape and murder of the woman. In December the UN released a report declaring that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">women in Afghanistan </a>[JURIST report] are still suffering abuse at the hands of men. In November the UN urged countries to implement policies that will <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-urges-international-effort-to-end-violence-against-women.php">end violence against women</a> [JURIST report]. Also in November the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly approved a resolution calling for a global <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">ban on female genital mutilation</a> [JURIST report]. At the same time, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report detailing violence and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hrw-colombia-women-facing-obstacles-to-health-care-legal-remedies.php">obstacles women are facing in Colombia</a> [JURIST report], where the legal framework is often not properly applied despite the government's progress in enacting legislation to protect violence against women. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In mid-February, defense counsel for Ruto asserted that the prosecution had failed to disclose a "significant volume" of materials relating to witness testimony despite having the "bulk" of the material in their possession prior to the January 9 deadline. The prosecution countered that it had disclosed materials in accordance with the court's special orders, which allegedly allowed for a "continuous flow" of disclosure during all stages of the proceedings. Both parties however agreed that the original April 10 date was untenable, and sought to extend investigation until mid-summer. The ICC on Friday found that only 70 percent of crucial material had been disclosed by the deadline, and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr880.aspx">delayed</a> [press release] the trial until May 28 to ensure adequate time for trial preparation. Ruto is accused of being criminally responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator for his role in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">2007 post-election clashes</a> [JURIST news archive] that resulted in the death of over 1,200 Kenyans. The ICC also <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of Ruto's running mate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Uhuru+Kenyatta">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [JURIST news archive] on Thursday for similar reasons. Kenyatta has been charged with crimes against humanity for allegedly bankrolling death squads that slaughtered women and children. However, both candidates have been cleared to run. In the wake of the charges, the <a href="http://www.africog.org">Africa Centre for Open Governance</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/03/08/Kenyan-vote-counting-challenged/UPI-91561362753120/">urged</a> [UPI report] Kenya's high court to stop the counting of votes in the presidential election to ensure that post-election violence will not occur again. 

<p>In December Kenyatta and Ruto <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] their plans to run together in the country's presidential race. Some have challenged the pair's campaign by claiming the ICC charges render them unsuitable candidates. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. In June the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">expressed its desire to start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the presidential election. In May the appeals chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/icc-rejects-jurisdiction-challenge-in-kenya-cases.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the jurisdiction challenges in the two cases presented by the defense, clearing the way for trial. The defense lawyers had argued that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the cases. The appeal stemmed from the pre-trial chamber's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icc-confirms-charges-against-4-suspects-for-kenya-violence.php">confirm the charges</a> [JURIST report] against the four men in January. The ICC claimed jurisdiction over the case despite <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">Kenya's calls for dismissal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s54is/pdf/BILLS-113s54is.pdf">bill</a> [S54, PDF], aimed at stopping illegal firearm trafficking, would make straw purchasing weapons&#8212;buying a weapon for someone who is barred from owning one&#8212;a federal crime and would increase penalties for offenders. While straw purchases are already illegal, the law is written in a manner that makes it difficult for law enforcement to prosecute offenders. Only one Republican, <a href="http://www.grassley.senate.gov/">Senator Chuck Grassley</a> [official website] of Iowa, voted for the bill, while several others on the panel voiced concern over unintended consequences and suggested the bill was done in haste. Although four gun-related measures were supposed to be addressed at the meeting, a recess was announced and the committee will reconvene March 12 to vote on a proposed ban on assault weapons and measures to expand background checks and improve school safety.

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December. This week <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2013/ag-speech-1303061.html">urging</a> [text] them to pass gun control legislation. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">Maryland Senate approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make it harder to get a gun license. In mid-January, Obama announced his <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signing of 23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws, as well as urging Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. The previous day New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to impose tighter restrictions on gun and ammunition sales, banning any magazine that can hold more than seven rounds and implementing instant background checks on all ammunition purchases at the time of sale. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 3-2 decision the Mexican high court held that two derogatory words used in Mexico to describe gay people are hate speech, and are therefore not legally protected. The case concerned a journalist who <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_MEXICO_HOMOPHOBIC_TERMS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">sued a columnist</a> [AP report] at a different newspaper for moral damages after the columnist wrote a story describing the journalist in terms used to denigrate gay people. The court ruled that although the terms were deeply rooted in Mexican society, their use is not protected when the intent is to cause harm to others. The court is expected to issue a full opinion at a later date.</p>

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mexico">Mexico</a> [JURIST news archive] has been at the center of legal and political controversy in recent years surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and other issues pertaining to gay rights. Two weeks ago the Mexican Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/Mexico-top-court-publishes-same-sex-marriage-ruling-citing-us-cases.php">published the written judgment</a> [JURIST report] for its December decision striking down Oaxaca's same-sex marriage ban. In August 2010 the Mexican Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/mexico-high-court-upholds-mexico-city-same-sex-adoption-law.php">upheld a Mexico City law</a> [JURIST report] allowing adoptions by same-sex couples. Earlier that month the court ruled 9-2 that same-sex marriages performed in Mexico City <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/mexico-high-court-rules-mexico-city-same-sex-marriages-must-be-recognized-nationwide.php">must be recognized nationwide</a> [JURIST report]. The court found that although Mexico's 31 states are not required to allow same-sex marriages to be performed in their jurisdictions, they must confer marital rights to same-sex couples married in Mexico City. Earlier in 2010 the court ruled 8-2 that Mexico City's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/mexico-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-law.php">same-sex marriage law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shortly after the official announcement Kenyatta's top election opponent <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile] announced that he would <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21723488">refuse to concede</a>[BBC report], stating that the election was rife with voting irregularities. The <a href="http://www.iebc.or.ke/">Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission</a> (IEBC) [advocacy website], however, has reportedly called the elections complex but credible and transparent, and has urged the candidates to accept the commission's official results. The final vote tallies showed Kenyatta with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenya-presidential-race-appears-to-go-to-uhuru-kenyatta-with-5003-percent-of-vote/2013/03/08/c9aff0b8-884d-11e2-b412-2e8596e7c927_story.html">50.07 percent of the vote</a> [AP report] and Odinga with 43.3 percent. Odinga has promised to challenge the election results in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/the-supreme-court.html">Supreme Court of Kenya</a> [official website]. The reported 86 percent turnout of the Kenyan electorate has been said to be the largest of any election ever held in the African nation.</p>

<p>Kenyatta has been charged by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] with crimes against humanity arising from violence following Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election. Earlier this week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php">agreed to delay</a> [JURIST report] until July the trials of Kenyatta and his co-defendant <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials]. Last month Kenyatta and Muthaura <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. In December the two Kenyans <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would be running together in the March elections despite the upcoming trials. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. Also facing trial are former cabinet minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [case materials] and journalist Joshua Arap Sang</a> [case materials]. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to confirming that the convicted individuals <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/09/egyptian-death-football-rioters">are to be hanged</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] for their involvement in the riot, the court handed down verdicts for the remaining 52 defendants also charged in the incident, which killed 74 people and injured more than a thousand when Port Said fans of Al-Masry violently stormed the field and attacked Al-Ahly fans from Cairo. Of those who received their verdicts on Saturday, 24 were sentenced to prison and 28 were acquitted, including seven of the nine police officers who were charged in the incident. The verdicts were announced on live television and sparked protests in both Port Said and Cairo, with Al-Masry fans angered by the convictions of their fellow residents and Al-Ahly fans angered by the acquittals of the police officers. Hundreds took to the streets in Port Said following the verdicts, and in Cairo <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/cairo-courts-ruling-in-deadly-soccer-riot-sparks-more-protests-in-egypt/2013/03/09/8a3a8c94-88cb-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394_story.html">at least two have been killed</a> [WP report] as Al-Ahly fans clashed with police, setting fire to a police club and the country&#8217;s football federation headquarters. On both sides it is widely believed that police were responsible for causing the riot, during which police reportedly retreated from the crowd and cut electricity to the stadium, leaving many fans to be crushed against locked doors in the darkness. 

<p>Dozens have died in street protests since the death sentences were originally <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-court-sentences-21-to-death-over-soccer-stadium-disaster.php">handed down</a> in late January, leading <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> [JURIST reports] in an attempt to quell the violent protests that subsequently erupted. Egypt has been plagued by protests and violence since the beginning of the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] two years ago. Also in January an Egyptian rights group reported that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">police abuse and torture continue to be ongoing issues</a> [JURIST report] and that police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. In December Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">indefinitely halted operations</a> [JURIST report] amid pressure from protestors aiming to block judges from meeting to rule on the validity of the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

China and South Korea, both major purchasers, are among the economies that still <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/03/09/national/japanese-food-still-banned-in-44-states/#.UTuBsYlevlN">set limits on Japanese food imports</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report] due to concern over potential nuclear contamination. While several countries such as Canada and Mexico are lifting their bans on Japanese food products, government officials fear many restrictions will continue, damaging domestic food export businesses. Large scale <a href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201303090069">protests in Fukushima</a> [<em>Asahi Shimbun</em> report] on Friday continued Saturday in Tokyo as <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2020519209_apasjapantsunaminuclearrally.html">thousands of people rallied</a> [AP report] in a city park against Japan's use of nuclear power. Following June's unilateral decision by Japanese <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14706109">Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda</a> [BBC profile] to restart Japan's nuclear reactors, Tokyo parks have seen hundreds and thousands <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/tokyo-protestors-demonstrate-against-japan-nuclear-power-industry.php">gather in protest on national holidays</a> [JURIST report] since the reactors were put back online, and protesters have gathered outside the parliament building in Tokyo every Friday evening. Only two of Japan's 50 working nuclear reactors have been restarted since the disaster.

<p>The Fukushima Daiichi plant was hit by a magnitude 9 earthquake in March 2011, knocking out main power for cooling reactors, and the subsequent 15-meter tsunami destroyed electrical equipment and disabled backup generators. The meltdown is considered one of the biggest man-made environmental disasters of all time and the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Japan has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, and international reception to nuclear energy has fallen sharply since the incident. In August Japan prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-prosecutors-initiate-criminal-investigation-into-fukushima-nuclear-disaster.php">initiated</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation into the nuclear disaster. In July a Japanese expert panel issued a report claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/expert-panel-claims-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-crisis-was-preventable.php">Fukushima disaster was preventable</a> [JURIST report]. In June more than 1,300 people <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/criminal-complaint-filed-against-japan-nuclear-plant-executives.php">filed a criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/index-e.html">Tokyo Electric Power Company</a> (TEPCO) [corporate website] for the crisis and for the plaintiffs' resulting radiation. The complaint named as defendants <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tsunehisa-katsumata/">Tsunehisa Katsumata</a>, the chairman of TEPCO, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/masataka-shimizu/">Masataka Shimizu</a>, the former president of the company, and <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/haruki-madarame/">Haruki Madarame</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> profiles], the chief of the Nuclear Safety Commission, along with 30 other executives. In March of that year TEPCO executives faced another complaint  <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/japan-power-company-shareholders-suing-over-fukushima-nuclear-crisis.php">filed by a group of shareholders</a> [JURIST report] for similar claims in the amount of US$67 billion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The activists were <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/09/world/meast/saudi-arabia-activists-sentenced/?hpt=hp_t3">found guilty</a> [CNN report] earlier that day of sedition, providing foreign media with inaccurate information, founding and operating an unlicensed human rights organization and other criminal offenses. Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/two-activists-jailed-for-sedition-in-saudi-arabia-1.1156069">founded</a> [Reuters report] the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, a group that documented human rights abuses, and the group has been ordered to disband. Al-Qahtani was sentenced to 10 years in prison and received a 10-year travel ban. Al-Hamid was sentenced to five years in prison, ordered to serve six years of a sentence from which he he had previously been pardoned, and received a five-year travel ban. The trial was open to both the press and public. The <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/">Arabic Network for Human Rights Information</a> (ANHRI) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=11689">demanded the immediate release</a> [press release] of the activists. Both men will remain in detention until a ruling on their appeal next month.

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against human rights activists. A Saudi Arabian court in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/saudi-arabia-court-convicts-egypt-rights-lawyer-of-drug-smuggling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed el-Gezawi of smuggling drugs and sentenced him to five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. El-Gezawi's arrest sparked protests by those who believe the activist was arrested for insulting King Abdullah. In December <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor who co-founded the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression. In August several international human rights groups sent a letter to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">">observe the trials of four rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Brigadier General, Mark Martins, who is the prosecutor at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] also insisted that the public must not hear about treatment of suspected 9/11 conspirators en route to Guantanamo. In <a href=" http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2013/03/08/12/50/KEkJO.So.56.pdf">filings submitted</a> [text, PDF] on Thursday at the US Court of Military Commission Review, Martins defended a 40-second delay in what the public can hear about the experiences faced by five suspected 9/11 conspirators. Several news groups are appealing the order including the <em>Miami Herald</em>, ABC, The Associated Press, Bloomberg News, CBS, Fox, National Public Radio, Tthe <em>New York Times</em>, Reuters, Tribune Company, Dow Jones &#38; Co., and the <em>Washington Post</em>. The appeal is unlikely to be resolved by April 22 when pretrial hearings commence for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheik Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] and his suspected conspirators concerning the 9/11 attacks. 

<p>This case involves the latest in a series of developments concerning the prosecution of suspected 9/11 conspirators. Last month the judge presiding over the 9/11 military tribunals <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">granted defense lawyers access</a> [JURIST report] for the first time to Camp 7, the secret facility where detainees are housed. Earlier that month lawyers for the US Navy <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-lawyers-say-surveillance-devices-did-not-breach-detainee-attorney-client-privileges.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that surveillance equipment deployed throughout the Guantanamo Bay detention center was not used to breach attorney-client privilege. Also in February a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-stop-to-911-hearing-censoring.php">ordered the removal</a> [JURIST report] of any monitoring system that censors the public broadcast of the hearings. In January the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-department-of-defense-declines-to-drop-conspiracy-charge-against-accused-911-plotters.php">declined to drop conspiracy charges</a> [JURIST report] against accused plotters of the 9/11 attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Laptop computers, iPads and the like are simultaneously offices and personal diaries. They contain the most intimate details of our lives," wrote Judge M Margaret McKeown. "A person's digital life ought not be hijacked simply by crossing a border." Border searches are an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant preference, but this holding serves to narrow the exception. The case concerned a 2007 search of a traveler's laptop which resulted in the discovery of child pornography. The Ninth Circuit found that reasonable suspicion was justified in this case due to the defendant's history of sex offenses and password-protected files.

<p>The Ninth Circuit's heightening of border inspections for laptops follows several previous decisions on the subject. In 2010 the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the government's ability to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-groups-file-suit-challenging-border-laptop-search-policy.php">search electronic devices without reasonable suspicion</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 Barry Steinhard, Senior Advisor of Privacy International, discussed why <a href="/hotline/2009/09/government-laptop-border-searches.php">reasonable suspicion should be required</a> [JURIST comment] for laptop searches. Also in 2009, John Wesley Hall, Jr., Former President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, discussed why <a href="hotline/2009/08/laptop-searches-at-us-border-implicate.php">reasonable suspicion should be involved</a> [JURIST comment] in border inspections of laptops. Also that year the Department of Homeland Security <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/dhs-announces-increased-oversight-for.php">announced new restrictions on controversial searches of laptops</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

While several of the defendants have raised allegations of ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement, judicial authorities have yet to investigate these claims. "This trial raises serious questions about the UAE's willingness to respect the fundamental right of all accused to receive a fair trial," said the Middle East director at HRW, Sarah Leah Whitson. The advocacy group implored UAE to immediately investigate all claims of abuse, and to deny the use of any evidence that may have been obtained through ill-treatment or coercion. HRW is also concerned that the court has denied trial access to a number of international observers and human rights groups. "The UAE authorities seem intent on keeping this trial as much under wraps as they can,'1; said Whitson. "If they are interested in ensuring a fair trial, they should allow international observers to attend the court sessions, not block their presence."

<p>The UAE <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uae-begins-trial-of-94-activists-charged-in-alleged-coup-plot.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 94 people charged with plotting to overthrow the government last month. The group of defendants includes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/uae-trial-coup-plot">unnamed doctors, academics, lawyers and other professionals</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] arrested over the past year and accused of forming a secret network with ties to the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] and designs to raise money in a plotted coup against the Emirati ruling families. UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. In late April AI and HRW called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST report] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. In July prominent human rights lawyer and al-Islah member Mohammed al-Roken, along with his son and son-in-law, were all <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uae-arrests-prominent-lawyer-in-ongoing-crackdown-on-islamist-dissidents.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] just a few days after the arrest of another prominent human rights lawyer, Mohammed Mansoori. A month later Al-Roken and Mansoori <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/imprisoned-lawyers-in-uae-go-on-hunger-strike.php">began a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest their detentions.

Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] cited three primary reasons for the withdrawal of charges. Bensouda explained that "several people who may have provided important evidence regarding Mr. Muthaura's actions, have died, while others are too afraid to testify for the Prosecution." The prosecution also expressed its disappointment that "the Government of Kenya failed to provide [the] Office with important evidence, and failed to facilitate ... access to critical witnesses who may have shed light on the Muthaura case." Bensouda also stated that the ICC "have decided to drop the key witness against Mr. Muthaura after this witness recanted a crucial part of his evidence, and admitted to us that he had accepted bribes." 

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X5odwmo0gys" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>

<p>The prosecution stressed that the dropping of claims against Muthaura should have no effect on the case against Kenyan president-elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, who was indicted with Muthaura for crimes against humanity arising from violence following Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election, where an estimated 1,100 people were killed.</p>

<p>Concern surrounding the trial has been growing in wake of the Kenyatta's recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">election as president</a> [JURIST report]. Last week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php">agreed to delay</a> [JURIST report] until July the trials of Kenyatta and Muthaura. Last month Kenyatta and Muthaura <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. In December, Kenyatta and former cabinet minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [case materials] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would be running together in the March elections despite the upcoming trials. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. Journalist Joshua Arap Sang is also facing trial alongside Ruto for crimes against humanity. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start Kenyatta's and Ruto's trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The human rights activist <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/11/us-bahrain-court-idUSBRE92A09720130311">informed Reuters</a> [Reuters report] that after he spent a month in jail, the court finally overturned the charges against him. Al-Muhafda, the acting deputy head of the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights</a> (BCHR) [advocacy website], was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bahrain-court-releases-shiite-rights-activist-on-bail-pending-trial.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] in January pending the trial. He had been <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-extends-detention-of-leading-human-rights-activist.php">arrested in November</a> [JURIST report] during an unauthorized protest. After being released without charges, Al-Muhafda was arrested again in December during a clash between protesters and the government in Manama, Bahrain's capital. He called the government to stop targeting human rights activists and to release outspoken Bahraini rights activist Nabeel Rajab whose prison sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-court-cuts-prison-sentence-for-activist-nabeel-rajab.php">reduced by one year</a> [JURIST report] in December.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a> [JURIST news archive] has faced international scrutiny regarding its treatment of political prisoners. Earlier this month, the country's court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bahrain-female-activist-sentenced-to-3-months-in-jail.php">overturned the acquittal</a> [JURIST report] of Zainab al-Khawaja, who has been accused of insulting a government employee, and sentenced her to three months of imprisonment. Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent Bahraini human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17793857">Abdulhadi al-Khawaja</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdulhadi+al-Khawaja">news archive</a>], and has served <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-activists-daughter-sentenced-to-two-months-in-jail-for-tearing-up-picture-of-king.php">previous jail terms</a> [JURIST report] for tearing up a picture of Bahrain's king, destruction of government property and organizing anti-government protests. Last month, Bahrain Higher Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-court-acquits-2-policemen-in-protester-death.php">acquitted two police officers</a> [JURIST report] in the shooting death of a Shiite protester during the nation's pro-democracy protests in Manama that began in February 2011. The Court concluded the two police officers fired shots at Fadhel Matruk but did not intend to kill him. They had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-police-officer-sentenced-to-7-years-for-killing-protester.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] earlier for the same charges. Bahrain authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banned all protests</a> [JURIST report] effective October 2012. In December Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php">commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protesters, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He noted that the situations in those states could escalate and detrimentally affect Myanmar's efforts. Quintana acknowledged that numerous improvements have been made but that there is room for improvements. He stressed that those responsible for the violence in Rakhine state must be brought to justice. In addition, he noted that those who were displaced by the fighting which began in June 2011 between rebels and government troops in Kachin state have to be cared for by providing humanitarian organizations with regular access.

<p>Quintana made similar calls last month when he <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-calls-on-myanmar-to-address-ongoing-human-rights-issues.php">commended the lack of reform</a> [JURIST report] that has been achieved in Myanmar. Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. In January the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] reported that more than 2,000 people have <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-voices-concern-over-myanmar-refugee-crisis.php">fled the growing violence</a> [JURIST report] in the northern Myanmar state of Rakhine and Bangladesh, leaving aboard boats operated by smugglers in the Bay of Bengal. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end to the sectarian violence in Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, calling on the government to do more to end the violence and protect the rights of the Rohingya, whose civil rights were effectively taken away with their citizenship in 1982. In August <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] reported that Myanmar's army is <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-myanmar-ethnic-clashes.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about both the continued violence in Myanmar and the country's human rights abuses committed in dealing with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.57_English.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF], presented to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], stems from research into more than 60 international documents categorizing nine interlinked trends of "grave" human rights abuses occurring in North Korea since 2004. The recurring trends, or "underlying patterns," include violations of the right to food, pervasive impunity, torture, circumscription of due process, public executions, and enforced disappearances. Darusman asserted that research has uncovered large disparities in categorical documentation resulting from North Korea's refusal to allow independent media into the country, restrictions on citizen's ability to travel abroad and the government's refusal to cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms. However, Darusman asserted that the "credible and consistent" information already collected demonstrates the pressing need for systematic and "well-resourced" investigative measures to examine and document human rights abuses. In addition, Darusman urged focused inquiry into issues of institutional and personal accountability for human rights violations, including assessment of when such violations constitute crimes against humanity. The report includes analysis from 16 resolutions from the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] and the UNHRC and 22 reports by Darusman's office.

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter human rights abuses in North Korea in the past. In February Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] their support for an international inquiry into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps. Also in February Darusman <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UNHRC and the General Assembly to investigate human rights violations in North Korea. In November he <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the country's lack of development in human rights, and called on its new leader, Kim <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Jong-un</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kim+jong-un">news archive</a>], to remedy the matter. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php">condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the drop in individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdown on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontnewyorkstate.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/supctmanh/">New York Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/sodaruling0311.pdf">permanently enjoined</a> [order, PDF] enforcement of amendments to a <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/notice/2012/notice-adoption-amend-article81.pdf">New York state regulation</a> [NYC Health Code 81.53, PDF] prohibiting the sale or provision of "sugary" beverages in large cups or containers by food service establishments. In October groups representing restaurants, beverage makers and movie theaters challenged the link between regulation-defined "sugary" drinks and obesity, and asserted that "food service establishments" were arbitrarily defined such that a New York City resident could purchase a large sugary beverage from one server after denial from another next door. Judge Milton Tingling agreed and found Monday that New York's <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/home/home.shtml">Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a> (NYDOH) [official website] impermissibly trespassed into legislative jurisdiction and overstepped its chartered authority by promulgating a rule that "limits or bans a legal item under the guise of 'controlling chronic disease.'" In addition, the court found that the definitions of beverage types and service establishments would lead to "arbitrary and capricious consequences" and thus permanently enjoined enforcement. The NYDOH and New York City <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website] have <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2013a%2Fpr090-13.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1">expressed intent</a> [press release] to appeal the decision to the New York Court of Appeals:<blockquote>We have a responsibility as human beings to do something, to save each other, to save the lives of ourselves, our families, our friends, and all of the rest of the people that live on God's planet. And so while other people will wring their hands over the problem of sugary drinks, in New York City, we're doing something about it. </blockquote>Bloomberg said that he remained confident that the regulation will be upheld on appeal.

<p>The NYDOH and the Board of Health approved Bloomberg's plan to promulgate the amended regulation in September, pursuant to which any establishment receiving a New York Health Department letter grade would be subject to a USD $200 fine for the sale of any sugary beverage in a container over 16 ounces. The NYDOH cited statistics connecting growing obesity and disease rates among NYC adults and children to increased portion sizes and the psychology of "thirst." Litigation over food health and safety has arisen in the past. In February 2009 the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/second-circuit-upholds-nyc-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New York City law that requires chain restaurants to post caloric content information on their menus and menu boards in an effort to address obesity rates. In August 2005 California Attorney General Bill Lockyer <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/california-ag-seeks-chemical-warnings.php">sought a court order requiring warning labels on foods</a> [JURIST report] that contain acrylamide, a chemical found in potato chips and french fries that the state believes may cause cancer. In February 2005, McDonald's <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/mcdonalds-settles-trans-fat-lawsuit.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] USD $8.5 million to settle a lawsuit over unhealthy trans fats in cooking oils used to make french fries and other foods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation explicitly provides same-sex couples with many of the benefits held by married couples, including dependent insurance coverage and the ability to adopt a partner's child. It goes on to provide that "all legal benefits, protections, and responsibilities of spouses ... apply in like manner to parties in a civil union." Colorado <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/governor/">Governor John Hickenlooper</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill into law. A similar bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/colorado-senate-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">passed in the Colorado Senate</a> [JURIST report] in 2011 but was ultimately <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-colorado-gays-idUSTRE7306G720110401">defeated in the House</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Later this month, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases related to same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>].

Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Illinois senate approved</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage legislation.

The amendments, approved by a vote of 265-11, with 33 abstentions, include several provisions previously struck down by the country's Constitutional Court. The amendments limit that court's powers, define family relationships based on marriage between one man and woman, allow laws criminalizing homelessness, and give Parliament the power to decide what religious organizations constitute churches. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Secretary General of the Council of Europe Thorbjorn Jagland <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/president/news/archives/2013/03/20130312_1_en.htm">said the amendments</a> [press release] "raise the concerns of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission) and of the European Commission with respect to the principle of the rule of law, EU law and Council of Europe standards. Experts from both institutions will now make a detailed assessment of these new changes to the Constitution." Rights groups such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] have also criticized the amendments and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/12/hungary-constitution-changes-warrant-eu-action">called for EU action</a> [press release].

<p>Just last month, Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hungary-constitutional-court-strikes-down-church-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that outlines how churches are given official designation, finding that it was too political. In January the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hungary-top-court-declares-new-electoral-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down an electoral law</a> [JURIST report] requiring voters to register to vote at least two weeks before elections in 2014. The new rules had been proposed by the conservative <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Fidesz</a> [party website, in Hungarian] party of <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/prime-minister-s-office">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official website].

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.00374:">Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act</a> [S 374 materials], approved by a vote of 10-8, would require background checks for private gun sales. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.146:">School Safety Enhancements Act</a> [S 1460, approved by a vote of 14-4, would renew a grant to help schools improve their security programs. The bills will now go before the full Senate for a vote. The committee postponed a vote on an assault weapons ban. Last week the committee <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-approves-first-gun-related-legislation.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would ban straw purchasing of weapons for someone who is not legally allowed to own one.

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December.

In his <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-56_en.pdf">report</a> [text PDF], Shaheed found continued widespread systemic violations of human rights in Iran, with reports from NGOs, human rights defenders and individuals presenting a situation where civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are undermined and violated in law and practice. Shaheed also noted a lack of government investigation and redress which he said generally fosters a culture of impunity and further weakens the human rights instruments Iran has already ratified. Among the most serious concerns, Shaheed noted the increasingly high rate of executions for crimes that do not meet the international standards of being most serious crimes. The report also notes discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities, denial of political and civil rights such as the freedom of expression and assembly and practices that amount to torture, cruel or degrading treatment. Presenting his report to the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], Shaheed said:<blockquote>The Government of Iran should adhere to their international obligations and protect the civil and political rights, notably the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression. ... Such rights are essential components of democracy and are all the more relevant in the context of Iran&#8217;s upcoming presidential elections, to be held next June. ... [R]estriction on freedom of expression and of association could potentially undermine the inclusiveness and fairness of the presidential elections.</blockquote>Special Rapporteurs hold unpaid honorary positions apart from UN staff, and are appointed by the UNHRC to examine and report back on a country situation or a specific human rights theme.

<p>Iran has come under increased scrutiny in recent years over its record on human rights. Shaheed and El Hadji Malick Sow recently joined the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion</a> and expression and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders</a> [official websites] to urge Iran to end its recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-to-release-detained-journalists.php">crackdown on journalists</a> [JURIST report] and release those who have been already been detained. The group called the recent arrests of journalists a "flagrant violation of Iran's obligations under international human rights law." In January a group of independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">urged Iran to stop the execution</a> [JURIST report] of five Ahwazi activists. Shaheed reasoned that these individuals should not be sentenced to death "for exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association, opinion and expression, and affiliation to minority groups and to cultural institutions." In October the UN Special Rapporteur for Iran accused the Iranian government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists </a>[JURIST report]. That same month the UN urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">stop all executions</a> [JURIST report] because the government had failed to comply with fair trial and due process guarantees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="http://0187c8b.netsolhost.com/Daily/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tashima-ruling.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] issued on Friday, Judge A Wallace Tashima found three of four sections of the law to be constitutional and denied a second motion for a preliminary injunction. Tashima found the section forbidding schools from offering "designed courses primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group" to be unconstitutionally vague, suggesting it would interfere with the teaching of legitimate ethnic studies courses. He ruled other sections are constitutional: "The Court's rulings stem in large part from the considerable deference that federal courts owe to the State's authority to regulate public school education." While plaintiffs argued the legislation violated free speech and equal protection of Hispanic students and teachers, Tashima noted that First Amendment rights were not compromised because the statute does not proscribe the rights of students to speak freely in the classroom. The judge rationalized:<blockquote>The Court recognizes that, in certain instances, Defendants' actions may be seen as evincing a misunderstanding of the purpose and value of ethnic studies courses. Equally problematic is evidence suggesting an insensitivity to the challenges faced by minority communities in the United States. Nevertheless, these concerns do not meet the high threshold needed to establish a constitutional violation, with one exception. Instead, they are issues that must be left to the State of Arizona and its citizens to address through the democratic process.</blockquote>The challenge to the law was initially launched in 2010 by teachers of the Tucson Unified School District's Mexican-American studies program that one judge found presented material in a biased, political and emotionally charged manner that promoted racial resentment.

<p>The Hispanic population has faced numerous challenges in Arizona, most notably in regards to the state's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF]. In June the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] sections of the Arizona law, but upheld the controversial portion allowing police officers to check immigration status of anyone arrested. Currently, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is considering another questionable provision of the law that prohibits the harboring of "unlawful aliens." The harboring ban had been in effect since SB 1070's inception in July 2010 until it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-upholds-arizona-immigration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Arizona in September. Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website], who signed the bill into law, <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/arizona-to-appeal-federal-injunction-on-portion-of-state-immigration-law.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the lower court's injunction in late September. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/zealand-gay-marriage-bill-passes-critical-test-105522774.html">approved</a> [AP report] by a vote of 77-44, in the second of three votes needed to become law. The second vote is generally the most critical, with the third and final vote viewed as more of a formality. The vote came after public pressure for the lawmakers to support same-sex marriage. The vote was widely attended by the public, who cheered after the bill was approved. Polls show that approximately two-thirds of the population support same-sex marriage. New Zealand already has civil union laws, which grant legal benefits for same-sex couples. The language of the bill only reflected minor changes from the original version passed by an 80-40 vote. The third vote may be taken as early as April. 

<p>Same-sex marriage has been controversial globally in recent years. Last month France's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/france-lawmakers-approve-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] which extends marriage and adoption rights to same-sex couples. The bill was approved by a vote of 329-229 against, with 10 abstaining, and must ultimately be approved by the senate in order to become law. Also in February the Illinois Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to legalize same-sex marriage. The senate voted 34-21 to lift the ban on same-sex marriage in the state of Illinois. Earlier in February the UK Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill. In June Denmark <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/denmark-parliament-passes-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">approved a same-sex marriage law</a> [JURIST report], making it the eleventh country to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/google-hit-million-fine-street-view-privacy-breach/story?id=18717950">settlement</a> [ABC News report] arose from a suit brought by the attorneys general of 38 states against Google for its collection of "payload data," which includes fragments of messages sent over unencrypted wireless networks as Street View cartography vans drove past that could theoretically contain any information, including passwords, banking details, or personal information, being passed over the network as the vehicle drove by. Google acknowledged in a signed <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/lib/ag/press_releases/2013/20130312_google_avc.pdf">assurance of voluntary compliance</a> [text, PDF] statement that the error was accidental, that no one's private data was shared, and that it would work on a new privacy initiative to try and stop a similar event from happening in the future. Attorney General George Jepsen of Connecticut, the lead state in the case against Google, <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?Q=520518&A=2341">welcomed the news</a> [press release], saying that despite the low monetary settlement amount, it is a victory for those in his state:<blockquote>[T]he importance of this agreement goes beyond financial terms. Consumers have a reasonable expectation of privacy. This agreement recognizes those rights and ensures that Google will not use similar tactics in the future to collect personal information without permission from unsuspecting consumers.</blockquote>Google's projected revenues this year are equal to almost $7 million dollars an hour.

<p>Various countries have alleged that Google violated privacy laws by capturing personal data through its Street View service. In June Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/switzerland-court-partially-rules-for-google-in-privacy-case.php">found for Google</a> [JURIST report] over privacy allegations reusing from the service. In March 2011 a Berlin court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Google, holding that the company's controversial service is legal in Germany. In 2010 a woman sued the company for violating her property and privacy rights by taking pictures of her, her family and the front of her house. The court held that because the picture was taken from the street, no such violation had occurred. On the other side, the French <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/">National Commission of Information Technology and Liberty</a> (CNIL) [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-commission-fines-google-for-violating-data-privacy-laws.php">fined</a> [JURIST report] Google 100,000 euros (USD $141,300) for violating the country's data privacy laws. Google captured personal data through Google Street View cars used for its Google Maps service but failed to respond to request in a timely manner and to stop using seized data. Similarly in 2010, the UK <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/">Information Commissioner's Office</a> (ICO) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-investigation-finds-google-in-significant-breach-of-data-protection-law.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that Google UK has violated the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act</a> [text] by collecting data through its Street View service. The ICO did not impose fines but announced that it will require the company to pay fines if it does not comply with the data protection regulations in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Macdonald was convicted of attempting to convince a minor female to engage in oral sex, which the state's sodomy law had regarded a felony. Macdonald argued that since oral sex was no longer a felony, neither should his solicitation be. The court agreed, voting 2-1 in favor of declaring the law unconstitutional. The lone dissenting voice in the opinion was unwilling to overturn the law as he felt that the law's purpose of protecting minors was sufficient in justifying the its continued enforcement.

<p>The decision in <span class = "casename">Lawrence v.

Sary was originally detained in November 2007 and was facing charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. He was battling heart problems and was admitted to a hospital in Phnom Penh on March 4 due to <a href="http://www.wmctv.com/story/21637790/khmer-rouges-ieng-sary-dies-amid-genocide-trial">weakness and severe fatigue</a> [AP report].

According to the ECJ, <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2013-03/cp130030en.pdf">Spain's laws contravene EU laws</a> [press release, PDF] because they do not allow national courts to stop evictions taking place due to possible unfair terms in mortgage agreements. The ECJ's decision came in the case Mohamed Aziz v Catalunyacaixa, in which Aziz, a Moroccan national residing in Spain, concluded with Catalunyacaixa Bank a loan agreement for &#8364;138,000 secured by a mortgage over his family home. After he stopped making payments in June 2008, enforcement proceedings were initiated and, in January 2011, Aziz was evicted, while the property was vested in the bank at 50 percent of its value. According to the ECJ's ruling:<blockquote>The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive preclude national legislation, such as the Spanish legislation at issue, which does not allow the court hearing the declaratory proceedings&#8212;that is, the proceedings seeking a declaration that a term is unfair&#8212;to adopt interim measures, in particular, the staying of the enforcement proceedings, where they are necessary to guarantee the full effectiveness of its final decision.</blockquote>In addition, the court noted that Spain's national courts must be able to assess issues stemming from default interest clauses, acceleration clauses and clauses on unilateral quantification of the unpaid debt. Spain's legislation currently allows a bank to pursue a mortgage holder to pay off the remaining balance of a loan if the value of the seized property is not sufficient.

<p>Spain has seen a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/23/us-spain-protests-idUSBRE91M0E220130223">rash of protests in recent months</a> [Reuters report], which some say are directly related to the country's eviction policies, as well as corruption and unpopular austerity measures. In November the country announced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/world/europe/spain-new-rules-limit-evictions.html?_r=0">new eviction rules</a> [NYT report] that many interpreted as a de facto moratorium on evictions. Issues related to unfair practices in the housing market have not been isolated to Spain. For example, in June 2011 JPMorgan reached a $153.6 million<a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] for fraud charges brought by the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for misleading investors during the housing crises. In December 2008 the SEC approved <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-approves-rule-amendments-for-credit.php">rule amendments</a> [JURIST report] that provided greater oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Phnom Penh court <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/cambodia-journalist-s-release-prison-step-right-direction-2013-03-14">reduced the sentence</a> [AI report] to a five-year term, only holding him accountable for a charge of instigating an illegal clearing and occupation of a forested area. Accounting for time already served, Sonando will in all likelihood face an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21781291">upcoming release from prison</a> [BBC report]. Many remain wary of the situation's implications, with Amnesty International's Rupert Abbott stating, "The introduction of new charges at such a late stage raises concerns about the fairness of the proceedings, while the suspended sentence may be designed to silence Mam Sonando." However, many view the overturned sentence as a positive step for freedom of expression in the country. 

<p>Before his arrest Sonando ran the independent Beehive radio station and has been an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itjSEgP_irLXkC295rkskXqtrM5w?docId=CNG.8abe2f71b33c3c1476737232dfa0bd37.b41">outspoken critic of the Cambodian government</a> [AFP report]. He was arrested in July on accusations of being involved in a plot to incite villagers in eastern Kratie to rebel against the Cambodian government in an effort to establish an autonomous region in the province. The court held that Sonando had been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19783123">instrumental in inciting villagers</a> [BBC report] in May to form their own state in the eastern province. An additional 13 people were convicted on similar indictments. Several hundred people assembled outside the court in support of the rights activist as his sentence was being handed down. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Co-founders Peter Sunde and Fredrik Neij appealed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-court-issues-guilty-verdict-in.php">2009 decision</a> [JURIST report] from a <a href="http://www.forvaltningsrattenistockholm.domstol.se/Funktioner/English/The-Swedish-courts/District-court/">Stockholm District Court</a> [official website], convicting the two of complicity to commit crimes in violation of the Copyright Act and sentencing each to one year's imprisonment. In an effort to balance the two competing interests of the co-founders' right to exchange information on the Internet with the copyright-holders' right to protection against copyright infringement, the appeals court concluded that the interference with the right to freedom of expression had been necessary in today's democratic society and that the petitioner's application for appeal was manifestly ill-founded. The co-founders relied on Article 10 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], complaining that their conviction under the Copyright Act violated their right to freedom of expression. In addition to prison time, the two co-founders, along with other named defendants, were held jointly liable for damages of approximately 3.3 million euros. 

<p>Sunde and Neij had <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pirate-bay-founders-appeal-to-human-rights-court.php">filed their appeals</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR in June. The appeals came after the <a href="http://www.hogstadomstolen.se">Swedish Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Swedish] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/sweden-high-court-refuses-to-hear-appeal-in-pirate-bay-case.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] their appeal in February 2012.

In June 2009 several Hollywood production companies filed suit in Sweden against the operators of TPB, seeking an injunction.

The statement comes at the conclusion of Emmerson's three-day visit to Pakistan in connection with his <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">ongoing inquiry</a> [JURIST report] regarding the legality of the use of drone strikes. According to statistics compiled by Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at least 400 civilians have been killed as a result of drone strikes, and that at least 200 of those individuals were probable non-combatants. Emmerson concluded:<blockquote>The Pashtun tribes of the [Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)] area have suffered enormously under the drone campaign. These proud and independent people have been self-governing for generations, and have a rich tribal history that has been too little understood in the West. Their tribal structures have been broken down by the military campaign in FATA and by the use of drones in particular. It is time for the international community to heed the concerns of Pakistan, and give the next democratically elected government of Pakistan the space, support and assistance it needs to deliver a lasting peace on its own territory without forcible military interference by other States.</blockquote>After asking the US to allow an <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of its use of targeted killings last year, Emmerson stated that there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct.

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US both internationally and within its own territory has come under scrutiny in recent months. Earlier this week, JURIST Guest Columnist Anthony D'Amato of the Northwestern University School of Law <a href="/forum/2013/03/anthony-damato-habeas-corpus.php">criticized</a> [JURIST comment] the US government for ignoring fundamental habeas corpus rights to conduct drone strikes on American soil. In January, Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister Hina Rabbani Khar <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php">condemned US drone attacks</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. In December, the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. In July Pakistan's Ambassador to the US called upon the US to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of using drone strikes in targeted killings. That same month US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of drone strikes. JURIST Guest Columnist Samar Warsi of the Muslim Civil Liberties Union recently argued that the Obama administration's drone policy <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">sets a dangerous precedent</a> [JURIST comment] and undermines national security.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/03/201331221118103218.html">executed by firing squad</a> [Al Jazeera report] after convictions for theft, looting and armed robbery. The seven were arrested in 2006 and sentenced to death in 2009. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] had previously <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/04/saudi-arabia-halt-planned-executions">urged</a> [press release] King Abdullah and Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Naif bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to intervene, as two of the seven convicted were under 18 at the time the crime was committed. Pillay expressed different concerns about the execution:<blockquote>Under international safeguards adopted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and reaffirmed by the General Assembly, capital punishment may be imposed only for "the most serious crimes" and only after the most rigorous judicial process. As I pointed out to the Government of Saudi Arabia before the men were executed, neither of those fundamental criteria appear to have been fulfilled in these cases. The term "most serious crimes" has been interpreted to mean that the death penalty&#8212;in the relatively few countries where it is still used&#8212;should only be applied to the crime of murder or intentional killing. In this particular case, no crime of murder or intentional killing was committed. Thus, the use of the death penalty in these seven cases constitutes violations of the international safeguards in the use of the death penalty. I am also extremely concerned that the death sentences were imposed largely based on initial confessions allegedly extracted under torture, and that the allegations of torture were not investigated. Such acts constitute a violation of international human rights law, as well as customary law that prohibits the use of torture.</blockquote>Pillay concluded her statement by urging Saudi Arabian authorities to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.

<p>Saudi Arabia has recently come under international scrutiny for multiple perceived human rights violations, particularly for conducting unfair trials against human rights activists. Earlier this month, a Saudi Arabian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-human-rights-activitsts-to-10-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> two human rights activists to ten years in prison. A Saudi Arabian court in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/saudi-arabia-court-convicts-egypt-rights-lawyer-of-drug-smuggling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed el-Gezawi of smuggling drugs and sentenced him to five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. El-Gezawi's arrest sparked protests by those who believe the activist was arrested for insulting King Abdullah. In December, HRW urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor who co-founded the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression. In August several international human rights groups sent a letter to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">observe the trials of four rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case arises from a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] claim filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] requesting records on the CIA's drone program regarding the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/appeals-court-reverses-ruling-allowing-cia-to-refuse-to-confirm-existence-of-drone-records/2013/03/15/8b84170c-8d83-11e2-adca-74ab31da3399_story.html">legal justification for using drones</a> [AP report] and information concerning civilian casualties. The CIA gave a "<em>Glomar</em> response," which allows an agency to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records following a FOIA request in certain limited circumstances, stating that disclosure of the information could damage national security. However, when there has been "official acknowledgment" of the information in question, then the agency has waived its right to claim any exemption. Following the district court's holding that there has not been "official acknowledgement" of the drone program, the ACLU appealed resulting in Friday's ruling. Noting that US President Barack Obama and CIA Director John Brennan have both acknowledged that the US has utilized drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Judge Garland stated that "it is neither logical nor plausible for the CIA to maintain that it would reveal anything not already in the public domain" in responding to the FOIA request. 

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under scrutiny in recent months. Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to Senator Rand Paul suggesting that a drone strike on US soil would be legal only in extraordinary circumstances following a lengthy filibuster by the Senator in the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director. In January, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">begin investigating</a> [JURIST report] the legality of the use of drone strikes. Following a request to allow an <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the use of targeted killings last year, Emmerson stated that there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct. Also in January, Pakistan's foreign Affairs Minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php#">condemned US drone attacks</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. In December, the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php#">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The draft constitution must be completed by the end of April and elections must be held by December. A spokesman for Mustafa Ben Jaafar, speaker of the constituent assembly, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-tunisia-constitution-idUSBRE92E0P320130315">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the establishment of dates for the constitution and election "is an important message to both inside and outside the country ... that we are on the verge of completing the last stages of the democratic transitions and going on to the stage of democratic stability." Lawmakers hope that establishing the deadlines will help ease the tense situation resulting from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/the-assassination-of-chokri-belaid-in-tunisia.html?_r=0">assassination</a> [NYT report] of Tunisian human rights activist Chokei Belaid, which has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21592419">sparked mass protests</a> [BBC report]. 

<p>Tunisia has faced political turmoil since former President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. In October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on Tunisian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-human-rights-watch-advocacy-2.php">investigate a series of attacks</a> [JURIST report] by religious extremists, and to bring those responsible to justice. In August, the<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx"> UN Working Group on the discrimination against women in law and in practice</a> [official website] urged the Tunisian government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-calls-on-tunisia-to-ensure-womans-rights-in-new-constitution.php#">ensure that women's rights are protected</a> [JURIST report] in line with the nation's international human rights obligations. In October 2011, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-stresses-rule-of-law-as-tunisia-conducts-first-free-elections.php#">emphasized the importance of adherence to the rule of law</a> [JURIST report] as Tunisia moves forward with its new government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law repeals <a href="http://www.ltbbodawa-nsn.gov/OdawaRegister/Legislative/Statutes/2007/2007-001%20Marriage%20Statute.pdf">Waganakising Odawak Statute 2007-001</a> [text, PDF] which only permits marriage between one man and one woman. The newly enacted law permits same-sex marriage, so long as at least one member of the couple is a tribal citizen. However, <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(gbw4d455zkuyqi45autiep55))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-I-25">Article I, Section 25</a> [text] of Michigan's state constitution bans the recognition of same-sex marriage for any purpose. Although the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=defense+of+marriage+act">news archive</a>] authorizes states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in the states that allow them, federally-recognized Native American tribes are self-governing and are not bound by state laws. The tribe's new policy is likely to cause friction with the state if a same-sex couple leaves the reservation and tries to have tribal court orders enforced in state courts.

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Later this month, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases related to same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the validity of <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in nine US states, as well as the District of Columbia. Earlier this month, the Colorado House of Representatives voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">legalize civil unions</a> [JURIST report] for same-sex couples. Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Illinois senate approved</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage legislation.

Prior to Senate Bill 276, Maryland's capital punishment laws were among the most restrictive in the country; <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2009rs/chapters_noln/Ch_186_sb0279T.pdf">Senate Bill 279</a> [text, PDF], which was signed into law in 2009, prevented a judge from imposing the death penalty unless one of three factors existed: DNA evidence, a videotaped confession, or a videotaped murder. Even before the restrictions were passed, Maryland had only executed five people since 1976. The bill has been sent to <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/biography.asp">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website], who has pledged to sign it into law.

<p>O'Malley announced in January that he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/maryland-governor-to-introduce-death-penalty-repeal-legislation.php">file legislation to repeal capital punishment</a> [JURIST report] in Maryland, stating that the death penalty is expensive and ineffective.

If signed, HB 1456 would make it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, an event that occurs at its earliest five to six weeks after conception. HB 1305 would ban abortions performed, "for sex selection or genetic abnormalities." Both measures are expected to face legal challenges if signed by Dalrymple.

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Earlier this month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation."

According to the report, the Syrian military has used cluster munitions in 119 locations across Syria, dropping at least 156 bombs over the last six months and killings dozens of civilians. The use of these munitions is prohibited under to the <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2010/12/CCM-Text1.pdf">Convention on Cluster Munitions</a> (CCM) [text, PDF], which Syria has neither signed nor ratified, because of the potential harm they pose to civilians. The CCM bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster bombs, weapons that break apart, releasing large numbers of smaller, self-contained explosives which spread out before detonating on impact. The HRW report is based on field investigations conducted after two cluster bomb attacks outside Homs and Aleppo killed 11 civilians and injured over 25, along with hundreds of Internet videos posted online by activists detailing similar attacks. 

<p>This is not the first HRW report calling attention to Syria using cluster munitions. In October HRW reported that the Syrian military was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">using cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against opposition forces. In July HRW reported evidence of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/evidence-that-syria-forces-use-cluster-munitions-revealed-hrw.php">Soviet-made cluster munitions being used</a> [JURIST report] in Syria. The Convention was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nations-agree-on-cluster-bomb-draft.php">initially agreed upon</a> [JURIST report] by nations in May 2008 following 10 days of negotiations at the <a href="http://www.clustermunitionsdublin.ie/">Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions</a> [official website] while the US, Russia and China each declined to sign it. In November 2010 the former UN Deputy Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/unop/YABAshaRoseMigiro.htm">Asha-Rose Migiro</a> [UN profile] had urged more states to join the CCM at the <a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/1msp/">First Meeting of States Parties</a> [official website]. The CCM officially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/cluster-munitions-treaty-goes-into-effect.php">went into effect</a> in August 2010, six month after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/cluster-munitions-treaty-to-take-effect.php">UN's announcement</a> [JURIST reports], as binding international law with 107 countries having signed the treaty and 37 countries having ratified it. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/national-security-letters-are-unconstitutional-federal-judge-rules">challenged</a> [press release] the use of national security letters by the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] on behalf of an unnamed telecommunication company. The statute allows the FBI to issue national security letters without court approval, requiring telecommunication companies to turn over information about their subscribers. Furthermore, the nondisclosure provision of the law prohibits the telecommunications companies from revealing anything pertaining to the national security letters, including notifying the individual for which information was sought. The judge held that the nondisclosure provision is not narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest because "the government has not shown that it is generally necessary to prohibit recipients from disclosing the mere fact of their receipt of NSLs." The EFF stated that "[t]he First Amendment prevents the government from silencing people and stopping them from criticizing its use of executive surveillance power." The order was stayed 90 days to give the government time to appeal.

<p>The EFF has strongly opposed controversial domestic surveillance by the US government. In November the <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California</a> (ACLU-NC) [advocacy website] joined with the EFF to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/aclu-challenges-californias-proposition-35-increasing-penalties-for-sex-offenders.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] portions of the <a href="http://www.caseact.org/">Californians Against Sexual Exploitation (CASE) Act</a> [campaign website] that requires all registered sex offenders, even those with decades-old misdemeanors and non-Internet related offenses, to turn in their Internet usage information to law enforcement. In September 2011 the EFF urged the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-groups-urge-us-appeals-court-to-preserve-suit-over-warrantless-surveillance.php">preserve two lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] over the warrantless surveillance of US citizens. In January 2011 the EFF released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/fbi-involved-in-hundreds-of-legal-violations-over-past-decade-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] stating that between 2001 and 2008 the FBI committed approximately 800 violations of laws, executive orders, or other regulations governing intelligence investigations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21812559">dispersed</a> [BBC report] a crowd of Odinga's supporters outside the Kenyan Supreme Court after they were told that they would not be allowed to congregate. Odinga called on his supporters to not resort to violence and stated that he would respect the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever the result.

<p>The challenge to the election results comes five years after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">Kenya's disputed 2007 election</a> [JURIST news archive] which resulted in several of Kenya's leaders being charged before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] with crimes against humanity. Last week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-drops-case-against-kenyan-politician-francis-muthaura.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] the crimes against humanity charges against former Kenyan cabinet secretary <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials] after encountering various issues with evidence and witness testimony. Earlier this month the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php">agreed to delay</a> [JURIST report] until July the trials of Kenyatta and Muthaura. Last month Kenyatta and Muthaura <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. In December, Kenyatta and former cabinet minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [case materials] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would be running together in the March elections despite the upcoming trials.

Journalist Joshua Arap Sang is also facing trial alongside Ruto for crimes against humanity. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start Kenyatta's and Ruto's trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The document, called the Agreed Conclusions, condemns violence against women in all forms and calls for prevention in the form of raising awareness through education as well as addressing political, economic and social gender inequalities. According to a statement released by the Commission, the document also "highlights the importance of putting in place multi-sectoral services for survivors of violence, including for health, psychological support and counseling, social support in the short and long term." UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6660">said</a> [press release] that he hopes all of the countries who participated in the "historic session" will "translate this agreement into concrete action to prevent and end violence against women and girls."

<p>The UN and others have been working lately to increase awareness and prevention of violence against women. Earlier this month, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-officials-encourage-reform-on-international-womens-day.php">urged governments</a> [JURIST report] to take steps to "turn decades of empty promises into concrete change" when it comes to women's rights, and cautioned that violence against women is still a serious problem throughout the world. That same day, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-signs-violence-against-women-act-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] an updated version of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s47es/pdf/BILLS-113s47es.pdf">Violence Against Women Act</a> [text, PDF], which expired in 2011 and provides for legal assistance, counseling and other resources for domestic violence and rape victims. Days earlier, legislators from UN member states <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-members-urge-legislation-against-gender-violence.php">discussed the importance</a> [JURIST month] of new laws punishing and preventing sexual, domestic and gender violence at the Commission on the Status of Women's annual session. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Both men were charged with profiteering and illegally selling state-owned land during their time as ministers under former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hosni+mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive]. Garanah was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/egypt-court-convicts-former-mubarak-regime-leader-in-corruption-case.php">originally convicted</a> [JURIST report] of corruption charges and sentenced to three years in prison in 2011, but a <a href="http://www.albawaba.com/business/egypt-corruption-mubarak-477584">retrial</a> [Albawaba report] was ordered in February. Al-Maghrabi was also <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-housing-minister-sentenced-to-5-years-for-illegal-land-deal.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to five years in prison in 2011, but Egypt's <a href="http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=473">Court of Cassation</a> [ESIS backgrounder] canceled that verdict in December. Both men currently remain in prison in Cairo, however, on other charges.

<p>Since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">ousting of Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] following the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011, the country has been working to prosecute Mubarak and members of his regime for corruption and other charges. Last month a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of former chief of staff Zakaria Azmi after an appeals court reversed his conviction for corruption charges and ordered a retrial. Weeks earlier, a court sentenced former interior minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habib+el+adly">Habib el-Adly</a> [JURIST news archives] to abuse of power for forcing public workers to perform work on his home. Mubarak's own <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">conviction and life sentence</a> was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned</a> [JURIST reports], and a retrial was ordered in January. The judge who ordered the retrial did not release the reasons for his ruling, but a retrial had been anticipated after the trial judge made it clear that the prosecution lacked hard evidence to support the charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Passed Thursday on a party line vote of 10-8, the <a href="www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/assault-weapons">Assault Weapons Ban of 2013</a> [S 150 materials] would prohibit the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of 157 specifically named military-style assault weapons, and bans high-capacity ammunition magazines. The measure specifically exempts 2,258 rifles and shotguns frequently used for sport. Sponsor <a href="http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/home">Senator Dianne Feinstein</a> (D-CA) [official website] and the bill's other supporters endorse a ban on military-style assault weapons partly because they have been the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-guns-idUSBRE92D0RI20130315">weapons of choice</a> [Reuters report] in several recent mass shootings in the US, including the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut school shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] that killed 26 children and teachers exactly three months to the day before Thursday's vote. Opponents criticize the bill as an infringement on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">right to bear arms</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that will have little overall impact on public safety because assault weapons are involved in <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-14/politics/37693009_1_assault-weapons-gun-violence-gun-buyers">small percentages of gun crimes</a> [AP report]. The bill carries largely the same prohibitions as the federal assault weapons ban that Congress allowed to expire in 2004. A full Senate vote on the bill is expected in about one month.

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the Newtown shooting in December. The Judiciary Committee passed <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">two additional gun control measures</a> [JURIST report] last week, one that would require <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.00374:">background checks for private gun sales</a> [S 374 materials], and another that would renew a grant to <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.146:">help schools improve their security programs</a> [S 1460 materials]. A week earlier the committee also passed a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-approves-first-gun-related-legislation.php">ban straw purchasing of weapons</a> [JURIST report] for someone who is not legally allowed to own one. Also this month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> to urge them to pass gun control legislation, and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">Maryland Senate approved a bill</a> [JURIST reports] that would make it harder to get a gun license in that state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa is being charged with obstructing or defeating the course of justice. The police were instructed to search the offices of Democratic Alliance of Zimbabwe for information about alleged crimes that were supposedly being illegally held. Witnesses said that Mtwetwa demanded that the police produce a search warrant before searching his suburban house for evidence. The arrested officials were held in custody on Sunday for questioning. 

<p>Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Last month three UN independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Zimbabwe to respect international human rights including privacy and freedom of association, in light of growing hostility toward civil society organizations. In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues."

Omani authorities detained the men in June for <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/oman">participating in peaceful sit-ins</a> [HRW report] in Muscat that sought the release of activists and demonstrators detained for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/oman-court-sentences-rights-activists-for-slandering-ruler.php">inciting protest</a> [JURIST report] and "defaming the Sultan" via social media. A Muscat lower court later convicted and sentenced the men to one year in prison and fines of 1,000 Omani Riyals (USD $2,600). After weeks of hunger strikes, the Omani Supreme Court agreed to hear the men's appeal and in March ordered retrial in eight of the cases. According to media sources, the trials of the other three protesters are still <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/eight-omani-activists-get-bail-in-retrial-1.1159279">pending in the Supreme Court</a> [Gulf News report], and release from the high-security prison may take several days. In addition, many fear that the men will be given fresh sentences upon retrial. 

<p>The Omani government has recently cracked down on pro-reform and human rights activists as well as political opponents. In June an Omani court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/oman-court-begins-trial-of-15-human-rights-activists.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of protesters who have been accused of defamation and illegal assembly by opening with hearing the case against 15 protesters, four of whom have been charged with defamation and incitement to further protests and strikes in an oil factory and the remainder of whom have been charged with illegal assembly. The Omani authorities have detained more than 30 individuals who have been protesting against the government demanding political reform, promoting human rights and calling for the release of human rights defenders whom Omani authorities have detained. During the same month, the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/rights-group-urges-oman-to-end-crackdown-on-political-activism.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Oman to release all human rights defenders who have been detained solely because of their legitimate human rights work, drop all charges against them, ensure security of the protesters in detention and take measures to protect human rights defenders when pursuing legitimate human rights activities from any harassment. In June 2011 Oman's Misdemeanour Court of First Instance in Muscat <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/oman-court-sentences-protesters-to-5-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 13 protesters with to five years in prison for shutting down a government organization, blocking roads and assaulting government employees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/missouri-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-mandatory-birth-control-coverage.php">vetoed the bill</a> [JURIST report] in July, but Missouri's legislature overrode the veto in September. SB 749 was intended to rebuff a policy by the Obama administration that requires insurers to cover birth control for women. Fleissig's ruling makes the temporary restraining order she issued in December permanent.

<p>The reproductive rights controversy has been ongoing. In September the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ninth-circuit-restricts-injunction-on-idaho-abortion-law.php">narrowed the scope on a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a 1972 Idaho law that makes it a felony to end one's own pregnancy. In August the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the <a href="http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/">Department of Health and Hospitals</a> (DHH) [official website] to revoke an abortion clinic's license immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-blocks-mississippi-abortion-law.php">blocked a Mississippi law</a> [JURIST report] that would have effectively shut down the state's only abortion clinic. In May Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed a bill allowing pharmacists to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/kansas-governor-signs-bill-allowing-phamacists-to-refuse-drugs-that-might-cause-abortion.php">refuse to dispense drugs</a> [JURIST report] that they "reasonably believe" might result in the termination of a pregnancy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Palestinians are expected to put forth a resolution on Monday calling for the implementation of the fact-finding missions recommendations.  

<p>The most recent conflicts between Israel and Palestine have raised concern of possible human rights violations.

The bill was <a href="http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/97810/bill-would-require-employers-to-offer-health-cover/">approved</a> [VPR report] almost unanimously in a 139-5 vote. Under the new bill, Vermont employees in a civil union or same-sex marriage working for an employer domiciled outside of the state would be entitled to the same health insurance coverage as hetero-sexual couples. While proponents of the bill applauded the result, opponents worried that the new bill would be subject to constitutional challenges under the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. Supporters responded by stating that the language of the bill ensures federal law is not infringed by the state's new law. If the bill is also passed by the Senate, the new law will be effective on July 1. Vermont's legislature <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">approved same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Last week the Colorado House of Representative voted 39-26 <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">in favor of a bill to legalize civil unions</a> [JURIST report] which explicitly provides same-sex couples with benefits already enjoyed by opposite-sex couples, including dependent insurance coverage and the ability to adopt a partner's child. Later this month, the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases related to same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in nine US states and the District of Columbia. Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Illinois senate approved</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage legislation. In January the Rhode Island House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/OTP-statement-11-03-2013.aspx">filed a notice</a> [press release] last week to withdraw charges against Muthaura due to lack of evidence that could sustain proof beyond reasonable doubt. One of the crucial factor was that a key witness against Muthaura admitted that he accepted bribes. Although the prosecution expressly stated that the decision of withdrawal would apply only to Muthaura's case, Steven Kay argued that the key evidence against Muthaura was the same for Kenyatta. Prosecution responded that it had sufficient evidence against Kenyatta and thus, could continue the prosecution against him. The start date of trial against Kenyatta was <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1564494.pdf">postponed</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php">report</a>] to July 9.

<p>Kenyatta <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">recently won</a> [JURIST report] Kenya's presidential election. Opposition challenged the result by claiming that the election was filled with voting irregularities. Prime Minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile], who lost the election with 43.3 percent, had announced that he will challenge the election results in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/the-supreme-court.html">Supreme Court of Kenya</a> [official website]. Kenyatta has been charged by the ICC with crimes against humanity arising from violence following Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election. Last month Kenyatta and Muthaura <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/kenya-post-election-violence-suspect-asks-icc-to-review-trial-decision.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to review the decision to move forward with the trial. In December the two Kenyans <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/kenya-presidential-candidates-facing-icc-trial-announce-joint-election-campaign.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would be running together in the March elections despite the upcoming trials. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. Also facing trial are former cabinet minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> and journalist <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Joshua Arap Sang</a> [case materials]. In June the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.</a> [JURIST report] to consider Arizona's 2004 <a href = "http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2004/dec04/prop200.pdf">Proposition 200</a> [PDF], which requires citizens to show "proof of citizenship" in addition to photo identification, to vote. Attorneys for Arizona argued that the law does not contravene the <a href = "http://www.eac.gov/NVRA/">National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA) [official website], nor is it limited by the NVRA, which says that states "must accept and use the Federal form." "I came here from Arizona on an airplane. If the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you don't need to bring a paper ticket. And then I got there and they said, we want to see identification to prove that you are who you say you are, that would not contradict the statement that they are accepting and using the e-ticket. They are accepting and using the e-ticket for a specific purpose." The attorney for <a href = "http://itcaonline.com/">Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.</a> [official website], said that approximately 31,550 known US citizens were prevented from voting due to the Proposition. She also argued that Arizona's requirement of proving citizenship rather than signing an oath testifying to citizenship or other means of proof, was what violates the NVRA. "[T]he State requirement of citizenship, it's permitted in the sense that Congress requires in three different ways that citizenship be affirmed. It's simply disagreeing about proof. So it's not as though citizenship is left off this form, it's simply a question of how it's proved."

<p>The court also heard <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1518.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-4-new-cases.php">Bullock v. Bank Champaign, NA</a> [JURIST report] to consider what degree of misconduct by a trustee will disqualify a debt made by the trustee from discharge under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523">Bankruptcy Code</a> [11 USC &#167; 523(a)(4)]. The case hinges on the word <a href = "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defalcation">defalcation</a> [definition], which has remained undefined in the code through all amendments since 1841. The attorney for Randy Curtis-Bullock argued that his client did not have <em>mens rea</em> necessary to commit defalcation&#8212;which he argued should have been "extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the actor"&#8212;and thus the debt he incurred when he mishandled being a trustee should be dischargeable. The attorney for <a href = "http://www.bankchampaign.com/">Bank Champaign</a> [corporate website] argued that other parts of the code&#8212;including sections barring debts from discharge due to fraud, embezzlement and willful and malicious injury&#8212;suggest that no mental intent is required for bad acts, including defalcation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-872.htm">Madigan v. Levin</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Madigan-v.-Levin-Cert-Petition-Ready-to-Print.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider whether age discrimination claimants can circumvent the <A href = "http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/discrimination/agedisc.htm">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</a> (ADEA) [materials] and bring claims directly under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, contrary to the holding of four other circuit courts, <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Levin+v.+Madigan&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39&as_ylo=2012&case=4600113945264397494&scilh=0">held</a> [opinion] that it is permissible to bring claims under those two laws rather than the ADEA. Age discrimination claims are notoriously difficult to bring to court, with 70 percent being found to have <A href = "http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/adea.cfm">no reasonable cause</a> [EEOC backgrounder] in 2012.

<p>The court also granted review in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-464.htm">Kaley v. United States</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CERT-PETITION-FINAL-FILED-October-11-2012.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to consider, when a post-indictment, <em>ex parte</em> restraining order freezes assets needed by a criminal defendant to retain counsel of choice, do the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendments</a> [text] require a pre-trial, adversarial hearing at which the defendant may challenge the evidentiary support and legal theory of the underlying charges? The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=677+F.3d+1316&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=13470602727197466954&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] against the availability of such hearings: "The Kaleys once again appeal, arguing that, in addition to traceability, they should have been allowed to challenge the factual foundation supporting the grand jury's probable cause determinations (the very validity of the underlying indictment) at a pretrial, post-restraint hearing. Because, as we see it, the defendants are not entitled to try the entire case twice, once before trial and then again before a judge and jury, we affirm the district court's order denying the Kaleys' motion to vacate the protective order."</p>

<p>Finally, the Court agreed to hear <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-623.htm">United States Forest Service v. Pacific Rivers Council</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2012-0623.pet_.aa_.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will consider if the <a href = "http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) requires the <a href = "http://www.fs.fed.us/">United States Forest Service</a> [official websites] to conduct <a href = "http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ind_tech/ind_study/eis/Envir_Impact_Study.html">environmental impact studies</a> [backgrounder] for all possible aspects to be targeted when considering a project, rather than conducting studies after the project has already been approved. The court will also hear arguments on the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ripe">ripeness</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of <a href = "http://pacificrivers.org/">Pacific Rivers Council's</a> [official website] claim, as well as its <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to contest the issue. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=689+F.3d+1012&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=14903874054361592161&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] that the US Forest Service's analysis of fish in the <a href = "http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds-43/">Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project</a> [official website] did not comply with NEPA.</p>

<p>The court denied review in <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-715.htm">Thomas-Rasset v. Capitol Records</a> [docket; <a href = "http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/12/Thomas-Rasset-PFC-12-10-2012.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], which questioned if there could be a constitutional limit for the statutory damages incurred when illegally file-sharing media. A Minnesota woman was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-reduces-15-million-jury-verdict-in-music-file-sharing-case.php">fined $45,000</a> [JURIST report] for downloading approximately 24 songs illegally.

The charges relate back to the 36-year <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm">Guatemalan civil war</a> [BBC backgrounder], which resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, including the murder of more 1,700 villagers of Mayan ancestry. According to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. This case, Pillay noted, marks the first time anywhere in the world that a former head of state was tried for genocide by a national tribunal.

<p>Montt has been ordered to stand trial multiple times for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity, and the trial will open Tuesday. In January a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> Montt to stand trial. Last May, Judge Carol Patricia Flores <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">issued a second order</a> [JURIST report] demanding Montt stand trial after ruling that a sufficient amount of evidence had been mounted against him, necessitating his testimony before a court of law. Montt was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bosco Ntaganda</a> [BBC profile] surrendered himself to a US embassy in Rwanda on Monday and requested extradition to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>]. Ntaganda has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icc-unseals-arrest-warrant-for-congo.php">wanted by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] since 2006 on charges enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 and of using them to participate actively in hostilities in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13283212">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+Republic+of+the+Congo">news archive</a>] from July 2002 to December 2003. Ntaganda remained at large, however, and in 2012 ICC Pre-Trial Chamber II <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-issues-new-arrest-warrant-for-congo-general.php">issued a second warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Ntaganda's arrest for additional war crimes and crimes against humanity in contravention of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]:<blockquote>Following a careful analysis of the material presented, the Chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Ntaganda is criminally responsible as an indirect co-perpetrator (article 25(3)(a) of the Statute) for the crimes against humanity of murder (article 7(1)(a) of the Statute), rape and sexual violence (article 7(1)(g) of the Statute) and persecution (article 7(1)(h) of the Statute) and the war crimes of murder (article 8(2)(e)(i) of the Statute), pillaging (article 8(2)(e)(v) of the Statute) and rape and sexual violence (article 8(2)(e)(vi) of the Statute) &#8230; The Chamber recognizes that the arrest of Mr. Ntaganda still appears necessary to ensure his appearance at trial, to ensure that he does not obstruct or endanger the investigation and to precent the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.</blockquote>The latest charges stem from evidence presented during the ICC trial of Ntaganda's superior, convicted DRC militia leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200104/related%20cases/icc%200104%200106/democratic%20republic%20of%20the%20congo?lan=en-GB">Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> [case materials], who was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sentences-former-congo-militia-leader-to-14-years.php">sentenced to 14 years</a> in prison after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/congo-militia-leader-found-guilty-in-landmark-first-icc-verdict.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in hostilities. The US embassy is currently working with the Congolese and Rwandan governments to facilitate Ntaganda's extradition to the ICC.

<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has called for Ntaganda's arrest on three separate occasions: most recently a <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/hrw-congo-president-should-arrest-general-wanted-by-icc.php">direct appeal in 2012</a> to DRC President Joseph Kabila, and previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-group-urges-drc-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect.php">in 2011 during an international conference</a> after its <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">first request in 2010</a> [JURIST reports]. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/LubangaENG.pdf">Prosecutor v.

In a nationwide referendum on Saturday nearly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21845444">95 percent of voters supported</a> [BBC report] the passage of the draft constitution, paving the way for elections later this year. The vote comes on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">January agreement</a> [JURIST report] between Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16010171">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6439617.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morgan+tsvangirai">news archive</a>] pledging their support for the new constitution. In 2008 the two political rivals <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">formed a coalition government</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">highly contested elections</a> [JURIST reports], ultimately finding a compromise to hold elections upon the condition that a new constitution was enacted beforehand. The provision limiting presidential terms will not apply retroactively so 89-year-old Mugabe will be able to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/19/us-zimbabwe-referendum-idUSBRE92I0IP20130319">run in the next election</a> [Reuters report] and potentially continue to serve as president for the next decade, a position he has held since the country's independence from Britain in 1980. 

<p>Last month three UN independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Zimbabwe to respect international human rights in anticipation of the referendum and potential changes to the system of government. The UN's emphasis on the protection of individuals' right to privacy and freedom of association accompanied <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a>'s [advocacy website] call for "credible, free and fair elections," a proposition that the advocacy group claims Zimbabwe <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to ensure</a> [JURIST report] in previous elections. Experts point to incidents such as the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/zimbabwe-charges-tsvangirai-aides-with-breaching-secrecy-laws.html">March 17 arrest</a> [Bloomberg report] of four Tsvangirai aides, working for the prime minister's political party the <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw">Movement for Democratic Change</a> [official website]. Held on charges of breaching state secrecy law, the arrests follow a string of allegations against political associates, including human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa who is being charged with <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">obstructing or defeating the course of justice</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to a <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2013/130318b.htm">statement</a> [text] from Citigroup, the agreement will settle "a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of investors who purchased Citigroup debt and preferred stock during the period May 11, 2006, through November 28, 2008." Citigroup denied all allegations, instead citing the desire to "eliminate the uncertainties, burden and expense of further protracted litigation." The class action suit was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/citigroup-to-pay-730-million-in-bond-lawsuit-settlement.html">brought</a> [Bloomberg report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/site_manhattan.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] in 2008 by a number of investment groups that purchased 48 issues of Citigroup's corporate bonds. In 2010 US District Judge Sidney Stein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071203788.html">denied a motion</a> [WP report] by Citigroup to dismiss the case. The deal is still subject to court approval. 

<p>Citigroup has faced numerous suits based on accusations the company misled investors during the financial crisis. Last year Citigroup <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-citigroup-settlement-idUSBRE87S0UA20120829">agreed to pay out</a> [Reuters report] $590 million to settle a case brought by stock investors who claimed they had been mislead, accusing Citigroup of hiding billions of dollars in toxic mortgage assets from 2007-2008. In 2011 a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York  blocked a proposed $285 million settlement between the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">US Security Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] and Citigroup over the sale of toxic mortgage debt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/basic_15/HB04244.pdf">legislation</a> [HB 4244, PDF], which was signed into law last year following <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-legislature-approves-reproductive-health-bill.php">approval</a> [JURIST report] by the Philippines legislature, establishes sex education requirements in schools, provides for government funding of contraceptives and other family planning services, and guarantees the right to receive reproductive health care information for all individuals. James Imbong, son of the legal counsel for the <a href="http://cbcponline.net/v2/">Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines</a> (CBCP) [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-reproductive-health-law-challenged-in-supreme-court.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court in January to block the law, claiming that it violates <a href="http://www.gov.ph/the-philippine-constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-article-ii/">Article II, Section 12</a> [text] of the country's constitution, which provides for state recognition of "the sanctity of family." The Supreme Court halted implementation of the law until June 18 when both sides will have an opportunity to argue their case. A spokesman for Philippine <a href="http://1.president.gov.ph/">President Bengino Aquino</a> [official website] stated that the government is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/philippine-supreme-court-halts-implementation-of-contraceptives-law-amid-church-opposition/2013/03/19/36ceeaa6-9063-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">confident that the law is constitutional</a> [AP report]. 

<p>Government funding for contraceptives and mandatory sex education continues to be a controversial issue throughout the world. Last month the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/obama-administration-loosens-regulations-allowing-religious-nonprofits-to-opt-out-of-birth-control-c.php">issued a new rule</a> [JURIST report] allowing religious nonprofit groups in the US to opt out of the birth control coverage mandate in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text, JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>]. In October France's legislature <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that pays for contraceptive and abortion coverage for minors. That same month, as US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rehear a <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/greater-texas/">Texas Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] funding case in which it ruled that a ban on state funding to clinics affiliated with abortion providers was constitutional. In May of last year, the <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">Tennessee House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tennessee-legislature-passes-abstinence-only-sex-education-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that augments the state's abstinence-only sex education curriculum to allow parents to sue school teachers or organizations that promote "gateway sexual activity." In 2009, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-high-court-rejects-religious.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a religious challenge to mandatory sex education because it said there is a strong governmental interest in compulsory education and the curriculum was "neutral and tolerant" toward religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Knowles</a> [SCOTUS backgrounder] that a stipulation by one member of a class in a class action to keep damages below $5 million does not, for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction, bind the whole class. The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ2/pdf/PLAW-109publ2.pdf">Class Action Fairness Act of 2005</a> [text, PDF] provides that class actions can only be removed to federal court for diversity purposes if the amount-in-controversy exceeds $5 million and that the "claims of the individual class members shall be aggregated." In this case, Greg Knowles, who originally filed this action against the Standard Fire Insurance Company, stated in his complaint that he and the class as a whole stipulated they would not seek damages of $5 million or more. The court ruled, however, that this stipulation by Knowles could not bind the class as a whole "because a plaintiff who files a proposed class action cannot legally bind members of the proposed class before the class is certified." The Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the <a href="http://www.arwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas</a> [official website], which originally sought to bind the class by Knowles' stipulation, and remanded it to that court for further proceedings.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-adds-2-cases-to-next-term.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in September to hear this case during this term. The US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit had previously <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/11-1450">declined to hear</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] the appeal, and subsequently decided <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10452905059842332547&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Rolwing v. Nestle Holdings, Inc.</a> [opinion, text], in which it affirmed another district court's decision to deny jurisdiction based on stipulations similar to the one at issue in <span class="casename">Standard Fire</span>. The Supreme Court's ruling follows a case decided in 2011, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1205.pdf">Smith v. Bayer Corp.</a> [opinion, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-allows-class-action-suit-against-bayer.php">report</a>], in which the court ruled that unless a court has officially created a class, a person attempting to create a class does not represent the interests of all potential class members.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among other notable findings, the report says (for all intents and purposes) that more people should be reading, and <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php?mode=recurring">contributing to</a>, JURIST.

<p>Okay, so maybe it doesn't say that <em>explicitly</em>, but it's a short step from the report's actual findings. According to Pew, <a href="http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/special-reports-landing-page/citing-reduced-quality-many-americans-abandon-news-outlets/">nearly 1/3 of news consumers</a> have abandoned a news outlet, citing less information and reduced quality. JURIST is on the opposite tack: we've grown our audience because our readers know that they can count on JURIST to deliver high-quality, documented, reasoned, and civil coverage of the world's pressing legal issues. We're able to deliver on our promise to document law and empower people because we know that our audience isn't reading JURIST for blood sport, but to <em>actually find out</em> what's going on in the world. </p>

<p>Pew also found that "the majority of people surveyed early this year had heard little or nothing about the financial problems besetting news organizations," with 36% of respondents saying that they had no idea at all that media outlets were generally under financial strain. Plainly, our readers can't say the same thing; I've been interrupting the regularly-scheduled programming for the last few weeks to ask for your financial contributions. You know that we need your support. </p>

<p>Summarizing their findings, Pew said that "[t]he job of news organizations is to come to terms with the fact that, as they search for economic stability, their financial future may well hinge on their ability to provide high quality reporting." I couldn't agree more. I'm confident that, if we continue to provide high-quality, timely, thorough, and thoughtful coverage, our audience will help us in our search for economic stability.</p>

<p><strong>JURIST needs your financial support to deliver the high-quality work you've come to expect of us</strong>. You can show your support through a single donation, or with <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php?mode=recurring">monthly contributions</a>.</p>

<p>So: how about it? </p>]]></content:encoded>

John Wiley &#38; Sons, Inc.</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-wiretapping-law.php">report</a>] that the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109">"first sale" doctrine</a> [17 USC &#167; 109(a)] applies to imported works. When Supap Kirtsaeng came to study at Cornell University, he realized that the same textbooks his peers used were sold at drastically lower prices in his home country of Thailand. He had his family buy the books for him, and he resold them to classmates, accruing approximately $100,000 in profit. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the court, explained that reselling copyrighted works purchased in a different nations does not violate the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/602">importation</a> [17 USC &#167; 602(a)(1)] facet of copyright law, as it is permitted by the first sale doctrine:<blockquote>Kirtsaeng, however, reads the words "lawfully made under this title" as imposing a non-geographical limitation. He says that they mean made "in accordance with" or "in compliance with" the Copyright Act. In that case, &#167;109(a)'s "first sale" doctrine would apply to copyrighted works as long as their manufacture met the requirements of American copyright law. In particular, the doctrine would apply where, as here, copies are manufactured abroad with the permission of the copyright owner.

<p>In our view, &#167;109(a)'s language, its context, and the common-law history of the "first sale" doctrine, taken together, favor a non-geographical interpretation. We also doubt that Congress would have intended to create the practical copyright-related harms with which a geographical interpretation would threaten ordinary scholarly,artistic, commercial, and consumer activities. We consequently conclude that Kirtsaeng's nongeographical reading is the better reading of the Act.</blockquote>The court heard a similar case in <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-splits-on-copyright-protections-for-imported-goods.php">Costco Wholesale Corp v. Omega, SA</a> [JURIST report] last year but split 4-4 on whether the first sale doctrine applied. JURIST Guest Columnists Beth Heifetz and David Cooper <a href = "/sidebar/2012/10/heifetz-cooper-copyright-kirtsaeng.php">advocated</a> [JURIST comment] for a middle ground approach: "If there is copyright protection against resale only for copyrighted goods both manufactured and first sold outside the US, then copyright holders are given the reasonable option to price goods differently abroad, but not the unreasonable option to punish those who are reselling goods that they legally bought in the US in the first place."</p>

<p>Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Samuel Alito concurred separately in the opinion to note that the decision will substantially narrow copyright law's ban on unauthorized importation. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and in part by Justice Antonin Scalia, dissented from the opinion. "To justify a holding that shrinks to insignificance copyright protection against the unauthorized importation of foreign-made copies, the Court identifies several 'practical problems.' The Court's parade of horribles, however, is largely imaginary. Congress' objective in enacting 17 U SC &#167; 602(a)(1)'s importation prohibition can be honored without generating the absurd consequences hypothesized in the Court's opinion. ... Because economic conditions and demand for particular goods vary across the globe, copyright owners have a financial incentive to charge different prices for copies of their works in different geographic regions. Their ability to engage in such price discrimination, however, is under-mined if arbitrageurs are permitted to import copies from low-price regions and sell them in high-price regions."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bartlett</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-gene-patent-case.php">report</a>] Tuesday to consider whether <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/design_defect">design defect claims</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] can be brought when a generic drug does not present all the warnings the brand-name version of the drug does, and thus causes injury. Attorneys for Mutual Pharmaceutical argued that <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-holds-federal-law-preempts-in-generic-drug-cases.php">PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing</a> [JURIST report] directly controls because the warning was critical to the jury's finding of a design defect. "We also have a case here that even if it were just purely a design defect case, at least with respect to a generic drug company, the Federal sameness mandate, the same Federal sameness mandate that applied in Mensing to warnings, applies in design defect cases. And therefore it is a classic impossibility case, just as the Court found in Mensing." The attorney for Karen Bartlett argued that impossibility does not apply, because if a jury found design defect in a generic drug, the manufacturer of that drug has the option to stop selling the drug, which makes the issue distinct for the brand-name's selling of the drug.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-236.pdf">Sebelius v. Cloer</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-grants-raisin-takings-case.php">report</a>] concerning whether a claim that was filed against the government untimely but had merit could recover attorney's fees. In this case, Dr. Melissa Cloer filed an untimely claim to recover from the <A href = "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> [official website], which took <A href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=160975">six years of litigation</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to deem untimely although otherwise meritorious, and incurred over $100,000 in attorney's fees. The Solicitor General argued that the clear reading of the act does not provide for attorney's fees. The attorney for Dr. Cloer argued for the reading of <a href = "http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm149461.htm">Section 15(e)(1)</a> [text] that states, "Any petition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of attorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two conditions are satisfied. It has to be filed in good faith and with a reasonable basis."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The call comes after two Tunisian citizens were charged with defamation for publicly exposing alleged wrongdoing of Tunisian officials. The men face up to two years in prison if convicted of the criminal charges. HRW stated that the Tunisian law does not conform with international laws protecting freedom of expression and that defamation is a civil, and not criminal, offense in the international community. Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW, denounced the law and urged reform:<blockquote>Criminal defamation laws have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and work against the public interest by deterring people from speaking out about corruption or other misconduct by public officials. It is high time that Tunisia consigned its oppressive criminal defamation legislation to the dustbin of history.</blockquote>HRW also contends that public officials should "tolerate a greater degree of criticism than ordinary citizens." Defamation is defined in Article 245 of Tunisia's Penal Code as "any allegation or public imputation of a fact that harms the honor or the esteem of a person or official body." Defaming an individual or state institution is punishable with a fine and up to six months in prison, while defaming a public official carries a punishment of up to two years.

<p>Tunisia has faced international criticism for failing to uphold its international human rights obligations. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-condemns-killing-of-tunisia-political-oposition-leader.php">spoke out</a> [JURIST report] against the assassination of Chokri Belaid, a political opposition leader in Tunsia who was killed by gunfire outside of his home, and called for an investigation into his death. Pillay described Belaid as "a prominent defender of human rights and democratic values, and a firm opponent of political violence" which he "publicly condemned as 'a blow against the democratic process in the country.'" In January, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-calls-on-tunisia-to-ensure-womans-rights-in-new-constitution.php">called on the government of Tunisia</a> [JURIST report] to adopt stronger constitutional measures to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12921&amp;LangID=E">combat gender inequality</a> [press release] and discrimination, while accelerating the participation of women in all aspects of society. In October, HRW called on Tunisian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-human-rights-watch-advocacy-2.php">investigate a series of attacks</a> [JURIST report] by religious extremists, and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill had previously <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/bill/2013R/SB2">passed</a> [bill history] the <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/">Arkansas House</a> [official website]. Supporters state that the bill will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/20/us-usa-arkansas-voterid-idUSBRE92J02D20130320">eliminate possible voter fraud</a> [Reuters report], while opponents voice concern over the risk of disenfranchising legitimate voters. The Arkansas <a href="http://www.ag.arkansas.gov/index.html">Attorney General's Office</a> [official website] is considering a request for an opinion on whether the bill violates the Arkansas constitution. Under current state law, although poll workers may request ID, voters are not required to present it. The proposed law would allow registered voters to obtain photo ID cards at no cost if the voters lack other acceptable forms of ID. Voters without ID could cast provisional ballots, but such ballots would only be counted if the voter returned with ID. The bill now goes to Arkansas <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Mike Beebe</a> [official website] for approval.

<p><a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#voterid">Voter ID laws</a> have become increasingly controversial across the US.  Last month the <a href="http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/">Virginia Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/virginia-senate-approves-bills-limiting-acceptable-voter-id.php">approved two bills</a> [JURIST report] restricting the acceptable forms of ID that voters can present at the polls. That same day, Lawyers for Pennsylvania and the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] reached an accord <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-suspended-for-primary-election.php">extending the temporary enjoinment</a> [JURIST report] of the Pennsylvania voter ID laws, and allowing state residents to vote in upcoming primary and special elections without submitting ID. There are now more than <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">30 US States</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 17 states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. The issue remains legally controversial, especially in <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-supreme-court-expedites-challenge-to-state-voter-id-law.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/wisconsin-ag-to-ask-state-supreme-court-to-reinstate-voter-id-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-supreme-court-allows-voter-id-question-on-november-ballot.php">Minnesota</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Northwest Environmental Defense Center</a> (NDEC) [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">report</a>] that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1369">33 USC &#167; 1369</a> [text] of the <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cwa.cfm?program_id=45">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [materials] is not a jurisdictional bar to suits seeking to invalidate certain agency decisions, and an amendment to regulations made by the <a href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] does not render a case moot when a litigant may be held liable for unlawful discharges under an earlier version of the regulations. The case was based on whether a business was required to obtain a permit under the <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/">National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System</a> (NPDES) [materials] administrated by the EPA for stormwater runoff from the roads of logging operations. NDEC brought the suit under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/1365">33 USC &#167; 1365</a> [text], the section of the CWA permitting citizen lawsuits. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court, "[&#167; 1369] does not bar a district court from entertaining a citizen suit under &#167; 1365 when the suit is against an alleged violator and seeks to enforce an obligation imposed by the Act or its regulations." The opinion continued:<blockquote>For jurisdictional purposes, it is unnecessary to determine whether NEDC is correct in arguing that only its reading of the [regulations] is permitted under the Act.  It suffices to note that NEDC urges the Court to adopt a "purposeful but permissible reading of the regulation ... to bring it into harmony with ... the statute." NEDC does not seek "an implicit declaration that the ... regulations were invalid as written." And, as a result, &#167; 1369(b) is not a jurisdictional bar to this suit.</blockquote>The opinion went on to address the argument that the regulations, amended shortly before Supreme Court oral arguments in the case, render the case moot. Kennedy wrote, "the [case] remain[s] live and justiciable, for the possibility of some remedy for a proven past violation is real and not remote." The opinion then turned to the substantive issue of whether NPDES permits should be required for "industrial stormwater runoff" from logging activities.

<p>The court granted deference to the EPA ruling that logging was the extraction of raw materials, and did not constitute industrial activity as described by the pre-amendment regulations. In doing so, the court reversed the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/05/17/07-35266.pdf">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a recent hot-button issue in the US and abroad.

Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In January the <a href="www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-change-marijuana-drug-classification.php">marijuana is still an illegal Schedule I drug</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act of 1970</a> [text]. In December, an Arizona judge ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November, lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report].

The conflict resulted in approximately 13,000 deaths with another 1,300 missing. The 2006 peace accord which ended the conflict agreed to establish a commission to investigate human rights abuses, but such a commission had not been established until now. Pillay stated that "[a]n amnesty for those who committed serious human rights violations will deny the right of thousands of Nepalese to truth and justice. This will not provide a sustainable road to peace." Pillay also expressed concern with the manner in which the ordinance was passed and stated that human rights organizations and the victims and their families should have been consulted. The commission further has the power to act without the consent of those affected by the alleged human rights abuses. Pillay stressed that "[y]ou cannot, and should not, force people to reconcile. Reconciliation, by its nature is a voluntary act." Pillay called on Nepal to withdraw the decree and also strengthen the country's domestic laws on torture and enforced disappearances.

<p>In January the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> (ICJ) [official website] called on the Nepal government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icj-urges-nepal-government-to-cooperate-with-uk-in-torture-investigation.php">cooperate with an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations leveled against Nepal Army Colonel Kumar Lama who is charged with two counts of torture during Nepal's civil war. In October the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/NP/OHCHR_Nepal_Conflict_Report2012.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">urging justice for victims of international law violations</a> [JURIST report] that occurred during Nepal's civil war.

The law is expected to be passed by the upper house in the current session. The lower house's changes would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/british-tourist-jumps-from-indian-hotel-balcony-to-escape-sexual-assault-police-say/2013/03/19/1c25919c-9094-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">allow</a> [WP report] as much as a death sentence for those convicted of rape where the victim dies or is left incapacitated. Those convicted of gang rape or rape of a minor will now receive a minimum of 20 years in prison. The law would also criminalize stalking, voyeurism and acts of sexual harassment. The new law would also lift the requirement of government approval to charge police officers and other officials with rape. However, critiques of the law say it does not go far enough because it does not address marital rape or immunity for military offices.

<p>There has been a growing outcry for harsher penalties and reform in technical aspects India's law since the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20765320">rape</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20860569">subsequent death</a> [BBC reports] of a medical student in December.

The human rights advocates further urged the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to condemn "the forced displacement of roughly 40,000 people, arbitrary detentions, torture, and killings," claiming that these acts are "widespread, systematic, and sufficiently organized to be crimes against humanity." According to HRW, armed groups from Misrata, a town approximately 20 miles north, are responsible for the "<a href="http://www.hrw.org/revenge-crimes-against-tawerghans-libya">systematic destruction</a>" [satellite imagery] of the town in "an apparent attempt to prevent Tawerghans from returning home." In addition to calling for the protection of the Tawerghans, HRW urged Libyan authorities to "promptly investigate individual Tawerghans accused of committing serious crimes during the 2011 conflict, including alleged rapes and unlawful killings in Misrata, and if there is evidence of a crime, prosecute them to the full extent of the law."

<p>This is the latest in the ongoing efforts to ensure a properly-functioning justice system and promote reconciliation in Libya after the 2011 conflict. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/libya-court-begins-trial-of-gaddafi-era-officials.php">trial</a> [JURIST report] of 40 former Libyan officials began earlier this month in al-Zawiya. The charges include inciting the killing of protesters during the revolution, wasting public funds, embezzlement and abuse of power. Last month the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">called on Libya</a> [JURIST report] to extradite former Gaddafi intelligence chief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profile]. In January the ICC asked Libya to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-asks-libya-to-explain-plans-to-try-gaddafi-son.php">address reports</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to try Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and al-Senussi in domestic courts. In October Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to allow the men to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. In August Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC </a>[JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was brought by five animal rights activists, all represented by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website], who claimed that AETA infringed their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights. The law prohibits the intentional "damages or ... loss of any real or personal property" used by an animal enterprise, while also banning the use of "threats, vandalism, harassment or intimidation" to intentionally cause fear to an individual in attempts to interfere with the operations of an animal enterprise. The Act does, however, explicitly state that the language is not to be construed "to prohibit any expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing or other peaceful demonstration) protected from legal prohibition by the First Amendment to the Constitution." Judge Joseph Tauro dismissed the challenge, finding that "none of [the] Plaintiffs' proposed activities fall within the statutory purview of intentionally
damaging or causing loss of real or personal property or intentionally placing a person in reasonable fear of death or serious injury," and so there was no showing of "an objectively reasonable chill on their First Amendment rights."

<p>The law has been used very rarely since 2006, though there has been <a href="/hotline/2012/01/will-potter-aeta-terrorism.php">concern</a> [JURIST commenty] that it would threaten activism. The AETA was signed into law by then-president George W. Bush in 2006, replacing the 1992 Animal Enterprise Protection Act. Supporters claim that the law contains adequate First Amendment protections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

EMA</a> [JURIST report], that the <a href = "http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_108A/GS_108A-57.html">NC Gen. Stat. &#167; 108A-57</a>,  which takes a third of medical malpractice settlements for Medicaid reimbursement, is preempted by the Medicaid Act's anti-lien provision, <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">42 USC &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)</a>(25), 1396k(a) [texts]. The court affirmed the lower court ruling for unnamed minor E.M.A. Justice Anthony Kennedy delivered the opinion of the court:<blockquote>North Carolina's argument, if accepted, would frustrate the Medicaid anti-lien provision in the context of tort recoveries. The argument lacks any limiting principle: If a State arbitrarily may designate one-third of any recovery as payment for medical expenses, there is no logical reason why it could not designate half, three-quarters, or all of a tort recovery in the same way. In <span class = "casename">Ahlborn</span>, the State of Arkansas, under this rationale, would have succeeded in claiming the full amount it sought from the beneficiary had it been more creative and less candid in describing the effect of its full reimbursement law.</blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer concurred to state that he believed the decision hinged partially on the <A href = "http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services'</a> [official website] conclusion on North Carolina's law. Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented.

<p>E.M.A. sustained injuries at birth that left her deaf, blind, and unable to sit, walk, crawl, or talk. The injuries also caused her mental retardation and a seizure disorder. She requires between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing care per day. To care for her the rest of her life, her family sought $42 million in damages. The state of North Carolina anticipated getting one-third of this amount under its statutory scheme. When E.M.A.'s parents settlement was reduced to $2.8 million, North Carolina still sought a $1.9 million fee to reimburse its Medicaid expenditures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Department of Agriculture</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-grants-raisin-takings-case.php">report</a>] on whether a party can raise the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] takings clause as a defense when charged by the government to transfer funds, rather than raising the claim after already complying with the government's mandate. In this case, a group of vineyard owners sold raisins directly to bypass a <a href = "http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> [official website] regulation that would take a percentage of the raisins crops, and raised the takings clause as a defense. The attorney for the vineyard owners argued both taking the percentage of profits and the raisins were in violation of the Fifth Amendment.<blockquote>So, in the demand letter from the Department of Agriculture addressed to the Hornes, they asked the Hornes to deliver California raisins, or the dollar equivalent. So that's the fact upon which all of this case is&#8212;is built.

<p>Now, what is the legal significance of that, California raisins or the dollar equivalent? It is our legal position, or it will be our legal position on the merits that when the government seeks a specific physical property, a <em>res</em>, or its monetary equivalent, that that is a taking of the <em>res</em> itself.</blockquote>The Solicitor General argued that as property, both raisins and money failed to pass the takings threshold.</p>

<p>The court also heard arguments in <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-52.pdf">Dan's City Used Cars, Inc. v. Pelkey</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">report</a>] to consider if several actions against state tow-motor carriers are preempted by the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/14501">Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act</a> (FAAAA) [49 USC &#167; 14501(c)(1) text]. Dan's City Used Cars towed Robert Pelkey's car while he was in the hospital for two months. Pelkey attempted state claims, common law negligence claims, and consumer protection claims to get his car back, to no avail due to the vagueness of the FAAAA. Dan's City Used Cars' attorney argued that "[T]hese claims are preempted because they are directed at the conduct&#8212;the type of conduct that tow truck companies all over this country every day engage in, in dealing with a particular type of tow that's referred to in the business as nonconsensual tows." The attorney for Robert Pelkey argued that there was a clear violation of Mr. Pelkey's rights that were not pre-empted by Federal law. "Transferring title and disposing of Mr. Pelkey's car against his will and not compensating him for the loss of his personal property is not a service of a motor carrier with respect to transportation of property. The regulation of State-created property interests is a field of traditional State regulation, and the broad sweep advocated by Dan's City Used Auto in this case would create a regulatory vacuum because there are no Federal laws that allow the sale of a motor vehicle."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2013/03/20/drones-will-require-new-privacy-laws-senate-told">escalation</a> [AP report] in use and technology have outpaced current privacy laws, according to these experts. The <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> [official website] has predicted there will be 7,500 civilian drones in the air in five years. They have also recently created six test sites for drones around the country and have accepted applications to create 37 more. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=d27f2c4073b40a8e678e4a9f6f36acec">experts testified</a> [hearing materials] that if the privacy laws surrounding the drones are not addressed, the full benefits of them may not be realized. One such proposal was a law requiring a warrant to be acquired before law enforcement agencies could use a drone for surveillance, except in emergency situations. While one expert called for a brightline federal law on the matter, another raised concerns this approach would be too broad and called for a state focused approach. 

<p>The use of drones by the US has been a growing concern, especially in a military context. Last week a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling on CIA drone records saying the CIA had to comment on the drone strike records. The week before that, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to Senator Rand Paul suggesting that a drone strike on US soil would be legal only in extraordinary circumstances following. In January, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">begin investigating</a> [JURIST report] the legality of the use of drone strikes. Following a request to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the use of targeted killings last year, Emmerson stated that there is still no consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenya-supreme-court-tells-top-politicians-to-keep-quiet-about-disputed-election-until-it-rules/2013/03/20/bbdf7938-916f-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">also warned</a> [WP report] civic groups and journalists that they could face punishment for biased statements that could undermine the court's authority. According to the court, journalists should limit themselves to fair and neutral reporting. The court noted that it had received three separate petitions challenging the election result in which Kenyan politician <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21544245">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenyatta">news archive</a>] defeated Prime Minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile] by 50.07 to 43.3 percent. Odinga requested that the result be nullified because the voting system was biased, giving his opponent unfair advantages. The court is required to rule on this case by Saturday of next week.

<p>The challenge to the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">election results</a> [JURIST report] came amid the decision by the <a href="http://www.iebc.or.ke/">Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission</a> (IEBC) [advocacy website] earlier this month which has reportedly called the elections complex but credible and transparent, and has urged the candidates to accept the commission's official results. Last week, Odinga <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the decision to the country's Supreme Court. Odinga has accused electoral authorities of "<a href="http://www.raila-odinga.com/news/item/265-raila-odinga-let-us-join-hands-to-ensure-elections-count">electoral theft</a>" [press release] and stated that he is appealing the results of the election to "ensure elections count." Police <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21812559">dispersed</a> [BBC report] a crowd of Odinga's supporters outside the Kenyan Supreme Court after they were told that they would not be allowed to congregate. Odinga called on his supporters to not resort to violence and stated that he would respect the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever the result. Kenyatta has been charged by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] with crimes against humanity arising from violence following Kenya's disputed 2007 presidential election. Earlier this week, Kenyatta <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop the charges against him for lack of evidence. The request came amid the withdrawal of charges against <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials] on the same day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Calling for an "independent and credible international investigation into alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law," the resolution encourages Sri Lanka to fulfill its legal obligations under the <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CTC/uncharter.pdf">UN Charter</a> [text, PDF] to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for its citizens in the continued effort to rebuild after the country's long-endured civil war, which ended approximately four years ago. Sri Lanka's representative to the UNHRC, however, argued that the implementing such new procedures would <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21873551">endanger the ongoing reconciliation process</a> [BBC report] within the nation. The resolution was ultimately adopted with 25 countries, including the US, voting in favor, 13 against, and eight abstentions.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009, and the most recent surge in criticism has come over the past few months. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Sri Lankan authorities are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">using rape as a technique to extract confessions</a> [JURIST report] from suspected members or supporters of the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [Council on Foreign Relations backgrounder].

The resolution was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/21/us-korea-north-un-idUSBRE92K0SZ20130321">unanimously passed</a> [Reuters report] during the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session22/Pages/22RegularSession.aspx">22nd Regular Session</a> [materials] of the council. The council voted to establish the commission of inquiry in response to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.57_English.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-international-inquiry-into-north-korea-violations.php?edition=world">report</a>] by the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/kp/mandate/index.htm">Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in North Korea</a> [official website] urging UN oversight and indicating widespread human rights violations including violations of the right to food, pervasive impunity, torture, circumscription of due process, public executions, and enforced disappearances. A North Korean ambassador observing the council denied the report's accusations and suggested that the resolution was politically motivated. The commission has been given a one-year mandate to investigate the alleged human rights violations and produce a report. 

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter human rights abuses in North Korea in the past. In February Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts announced their <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">support for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps. Also in February Darusman urged the UNHRC and the General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">investigate human rights violations in North Korea</a> [JURIST report]. In November he expressed concern over the country's <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">lack of development in human rights</a>, and called on its new leader, Kim Jong-un, to remedy the matter. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php">condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the drop in individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdown on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yakub Abdul Razak Memon, brother of mastermind "Tiger" Memon, was convicted in 2006 for his role in orchestrating the attacks that spread havoc throughout the city and included a horrific attack on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The court, in upholding the sentence, found that his actions were "carried out with utter disregard to human life and dignity" which justifies the rare imposition of the death penalty.

<p>The court also <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/03/201332163853512530.html">announced</a> [Al Jazeera report] its <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/outtoday/1060.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] in a related case deciding that popular Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt must return to prison to serve a five-year sentence for having purchased weapons from some of those who carried out the Mumbai blasts. Dutt had purchased weapons for himself from friends who were part of the terrorist group responsible for the attacks. Dutt had been sentenced initially to a six-year team which was lowered to five years by the court.<br />

The court denied bail to Beatrice Mtetwa after prosecutors argued that she <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-court-denies-bail-to-top-human-rights-lawyer-who-must-stay-in-jail-until-april-3/2013/03/20/525956e4-9171-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">may be a flight risk</a> [AP report] because she is a citizen of Swaziland. Mtetwa is accused of interfering with a police search of her clients' office, but she contends that she was only asking the officers to produce a valid warrant. Mtetwa was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">arrested on Sunday</a> [JURIST report], just a day after the country voted in a constitutional referendum to increase protections against human rights violations. Human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/zimbabwe-must-immediately-release-prominent-human-rights-lawyer-2013-03-20">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have said that the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/zimbabwe-must-immediately-release-prominent-human-rights-lawyer-2013-03-20">arrest was unlawful</a> [AI press release]. Mtetwa's lawyers have said that they will immediately appeal the bail decision. 

<p>Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Last month three UN independent human rights experts urged the government of Zimbabwe to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">respect international human rights</a> [JURIST report] including privacy and freedom of association, in light of growing hostility toward civil society organizations. In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues." In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to ensure "credible, free and fair elections."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bills were signed eight months after the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, that left <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_21124893/12-shot-dead-58-wounded-aurora-movie-theater">12 dead and 58 wounded</a> [<em>Denver Post</em> report]. Hickenlooper issued a statement upon signing the legislation, which maintained the constitutionality of the large-capacity bill under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text] of the US Constitution.

<p>A number of State and Federal gun control measures have been introduced in the US since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut in December that left 27 killed, including 20 children. Last week, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] two gun control measures which would require background checks for private gun sales and improve security at schools. The Committee also approved a ban on assault weapons, but that bill <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">will not be part of gun control legislation the entire Senate will take up</a> [NY Times report] next month and will instead be offered as an amendment. Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging passage of gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines and military style assault weapons. Also this month, the Maryland State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill making it more difficult to obtain a gun license. In January, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures.

The bill will go to the Senate, an unelected body, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canadas-house-of-commons-passes-transgender-rights-law/2013/03/20/981cd890-91c6-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">for final approval</a> [AP report]. The bill passed the House of Commons by a vote of 149-136 with the help of 16 conservatives despite opposition from the Prime Minister. The bill amends the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/H-6.pdf">Canadian Human Rights Act</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-153.html#h-92">hate propaganda section of the Criminal code</a> [text] to include "gender identity" and "gender expression" as an improper basis for discrimination and hate speech.

<p>Discrimination against LGBT individuals has been a contentious issue throughout the world. In January, the Virginia State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/virginia-senate-passes-bill-to-protect-state-lgbt-employees-from-discrimination.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to protect state LGBT employees from discrimination. In July of last year, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-sexual-orientation-discrimination.php">called for an end to sexual orientation discrimination</a> [JURIST report]. In June, a group of LGBT plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/tennessee-plaintiffs-to-appeal-dismissal-of-anti-discrimination-suit.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in their suit challenging a Tennessee law that bars local governments from creating anti-discrimination laws that are stricter than those of the state. The US Senate HELP Committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/senate-committee-holds-hearing-on-sexual-orientation-discrimination-bill.php">held a hearing</a> in June on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), focusing on discrimination faced by LGBT employees across the country. In 2011, the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released its <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-report-details-global-violence-against-lgbt-individuals.php">first ever report</a> [JURIST report] on the global human rights of LGBT individuals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Thomas Thrash <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/RIPRJ/de0a5f8f5c914cfeacedc425a18a60eb/Article_2013-03-20-Immigration%20Law-Georgia/id-ddde35f4cfb44b60a9fecd2d4451879c">struck down</a> [AP report] this provision, reasoning that the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] already held that this portion of Georgia's immigration law was preempted by federal law. In addition, Thrash <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/federal-judge-blocks-georgia-immigration-law/nWyW9/">ordered</a> [AJC report] the state to inform Georgia's law enforcement agencies of his decision so that state agencies do not enforce that provision of the immigration law. The provision would have carried a punishment of up to 12 months in prison and fines of up to $1,000. The lawsuit was brought into federal court by civil and immigrant rights groups who argued that the provision was unconstitutional. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. In January, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/alabama-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to overturn a recent decision striking down provisions of Alabama's controversial <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 56, PDF]. In December Thrash lifted a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. Thrash's order was in line with an August ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">upheld </a>[JURIST report] that provision of the law, but it remains to be seen how police will enforce the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Syrian government <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44450&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.UUxZDBlZ_-k">requested the probe</a> [UN News Centre report] earlier this week after anti-government forces carried out an attack on a village near Aleppo. Ban declared that the investigation will involve other international bodies such as the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> and the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> [official websites]. In his remarks, Ban stated that any use of chemical weapons would be a serious crime and that the Syrian government has the primary responsibility of ensuring the security of chemical weapons. Ban said that the investigation would start as soon as possible.

<p>The <a href="/feature/2013/03/the-syrian-civil-war.php">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has lasted for nearly two years, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Last week <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">accused Syria's military</a> [JURIST report] of using banned cluster bombs against civilians. Last month the UN said that both the Syrian government and anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the death toll resulting from two years of armed conflict in Syria is approaching 70,000. In January more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. A study carried out by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported in January that the average number of deaths per month has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-office-more-than-60000-killed-in-syria-conflict.php">increased significantly</a> [JURIST report] since the summer of 2011, where the average was approximately 1,000 per month, to an average of 5,000 deaths per month since July 2012. A UN official said in November that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October, Pillay called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/india-lower-house-approves-anti-rape-legislation.php">approved by the lower house</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, increases the punishment for crimes such as rape, stalking and voyeurism. It imposes a jail term for up to seven years for stalking and voyeurism and allows for the death penalty in rape cases in which the victim <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324103504578373991905281104.html">dies or goes into a coma</a> [WSJ report]. Also contained in the bill are a provision that requires hospitals to provide treatment to rape victims and a provision that imposes a 10-year jail term on anyone who damages a woman's body by throwing acid on it. The bill now goes to <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/">President Pranab Mukherjee</a> [official website], who is expected to sign it into law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org">American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico</a> (ACLU-NM) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Final-Complaint.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in a New Mexico state court on behalf of <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/meet-our-plaintiffs/2013/03/">two same-sex couples</a> [ACLU backgrounder] seeking the legal right to marry. According to the complaint, the country clerk denied the plaintiffs' application for marriage licenses in March solely because the couples were "of the same sex." The plaintiffs seek a declaration that it is unlawful for the state to prohibit marriage on the basis of sex or sexual orientation on grounds that such denial violates the <a href="http://sos.state.nm.us/pdf/2007nmconst.pdf">New Mexico Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and contravenes "fundamental rights and liberties." In addition, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin county authorities to implement and enforce extant state marriage laws without "discrimination on the basis of sex or sexual orientation." The complaint asserts that the current state of enforcement evinces entrenched discrimination towards the LGBT community:<blockquote>Marriage plays a unique and central social, legal, and economic role in American society. Being married reflects the commitment that a couple makes to one another, as well as representing a public acknowledgement of the value, legitimacy, depth, and permanence of the married couple's private relationship. Marriage is also the sole legal institution in New Mexico through which couples can create a family unit that the state recognizes and protects. ... Conversely, denial to some couples of the status of being married in the eyes of the State conveys the State's view that the couple's private relationship is of lesser value and unworthy of legal recognition and support. This public rejection of the Plaintiffs' most significant relationship damages them and their children, and promotes the view that their relationships and families are inferior to those of other committed couples.</blockquote>According to the ACLU, <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/aclu-nm-files-lawsuit-for-the-freedom-to-marry-for-same-sex-couples/2013/03/">New Mexico is currently the only state</a> [press release] that neither expressly recognizes nor bans same-sex relationships through marriage or civil union. However, other challenges have arisen. Sante Fe Mayor <a href="http://www.santafenm.gov/index.aspx?NID=66">David Cross</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/article_a9e2eedf-977d-5b8a-bc36-afcf35c31ee2.html">announced his support</a> [<em>Sante Fe New Mexican</em> report] for a resolution ordering county clerks across the state to issue marriage licenses same-sex couples. The ACLU in turn <a href="http://www.aclu-nm.org/aclu-affirms-santa-fe-mayors-statement-current-new-mexico-laws-dont-prohibit-same-sex-couples-from-marrying/2013/03/">praised</a> [press release] the mayor's announcement. 

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Earlier this month Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March the Colorado House of Representative <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-lawmakers-approve-civil-unions-for-same-sex-couples.php">voted 39-26 in favor of a bill to legalize civil unions</a> [JURIST report] which explicitly provides same-sex couples with benefits already enjoyed by opposite-sex couples, including dependent insurance coverage and the ability to adopt a partner's child. Later this month the US Supreme Court will hear arguments in two cases related to same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v.

The ruling cited a <a href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=78740">constitutional amendment</a> [text] that was passed last year through referendum, making the right to bear arms a fundamental right in Louisiana. The <a href="http://www.opdla.org/">Orleans Parish public defenders office</a> [official website] challenged the constitutionality of the statute on behalf of six clients all charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm. In his decision, Judge Darryl Derbigny concluded that the recent amendment to the state constitution heightened the level of scrutiny that courts must use when considering gun control laws. The amendment declares the right to bear arms is a fundamental right in Louisiana, putting it on par with rights such as the freedom of speech and religion, that are evaluated based on strict scrutiny. Derbigny ruled that the statute infringed on constitutional protections when analyzed under a strict scrutiny test. The issue will now go to the <a href="http://www.lasc.org/">Louisiana Supreme Court</a> [official website], which must decide whether or not the statute infringes on state citizens' right to gun possession.  

<p>Gun control has remained a controversial issue in recent years, especially since the since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December. In November when <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/louisiana-voters-approve-strongest-protection-for-right-to-bear-arms.php">Louisiana voted to approve the constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report], it created the strongest protection of the right to keep and bear arms in the nation. This week <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">Colorado governor signed three bills into law</a> [JURIST report] which seek to address gun violence. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] two gun control measures which would require background checks for private gun sales and improve security at schools. Also this month, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">US Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging passage of gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines and military style assault weapons. In January, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures.

The three-judge panel unanimously overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-maryland-gun-law-found-unconstitutional.php">2012 district court ruling</a> [JURIST report] finding that the requirement violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text]. In an opinion authored by Judge Robert King, the appeals court held that the good-and-substantial-reason requirement passed constitutional muster:<blockquote>In summary, although we assume that Appellee Woollard's Second Amendment right is burdened by the good-and-substantial-reason requirement, we further conclude that such burden is constitutionally permissible. That is, under the applicable intermediate scrutiny standard, the State has demonstrated that the good-and-substantial-reason requirement is reasonably adapted to Maryland's significant interests in protecting public safety and preventing crime.</blockquote>Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-03-21/news/bal-federal-appellate-court-rejects-challenge-to-md-handgun-permit-laws-20130321_1_raymond-woollard-appeals-court-second-amendment-foundation">praised the court's ruling</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] as a victory for public safety in Maryland.

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December.

Perry</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>].

Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/illinois-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Illinois senate approved</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage legislation.

The language of the bill currently prohibits cities and counties from restricting individuals from carrying firearms:<blockquote>No city or county shall adopt any ordinance, resolution or regulation, and no agent of any city or county shall take any administrative action, governing the purchase, transfer, ownership, storage, carrying on one's person or transporting of firearms or ammunition, or any component or combination thereof. Any such ordinance, resolution or regulation adopted prior to the effective date of this 2007 act shall be null and void.</blockquote>This provision would <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/kansas-open-carry-gun_n_2934979.html">nullify</a> [Huffington Post Report] laws in Kansas City, Leawood and Prairie Village, which all ban the open carry and transport of guns. The law does specify some areas where open carry or possession of a gun is prohibited, including the Capitol, which conflicts with other legislation that passed through the full state House last week, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/kansas-open-carry-capitol_n_2879387.html">allowing the open carry of firearms</a> [Huffington Post report] in the state Capitol. 

<p>Gun control has been the center of attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December. Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2013/ag-speech-1303061.html">urging</a> [text] lawmakers to pass gun control legislation. Also this month the Maryland Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">approved a different bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make it harder to get a gun license. In mid-January, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urge Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. The previous day New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to impose tighter restrictions on gun and ammunition sales, banning any magazine that can hold more than seven rounds and implementing instant background checks on all ammunition purchases at the time of sale.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Utah state representative <a href="http://le.utah.gov/house2/detail.jsp?i=MATHIJG">John Mathis</a> (R) [official website], the lead sponsor of <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2013/bills/static/HB0076.html">the bill</a> [HB 76, materials], said that the bill would simply allow citizens who openly carry unloaded weapons to <a href="http://magicvalley.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/utah-governor-vetoes-bill-to-carry-concealed-gun/article_5648e0c0-932a-11e2-9317-0019bb2963f4.html?comment_form=true">put a coat or other cover over these weapons in bad weather</a> [AP report]. In the press release accompanying his veto of the bill, Herbert explained that while he understood Mathis's argument, public safety outweighs the concerns that the bill addresses: <blockquote>As I followed the debate on this bill, I heard that this legislation is needed because some fear they will be in violation of the law if, because of a sudden gust of wind, their coat temporarily conceals their otherwise openly and legally carried firearm. I understand that concern, but am unwilling to discard an entire system that benefits the people of Utah and is supported by law enforcement when there could be a solution more narrowly tailored to address that issue.</blockquote>  The Utah legislature has until May 13 to call a session to try to override Herbert's veto. 

<p>A number of state and federal gun control measures have been introduced in the US since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut in December that left 27 dead, including 20 children. Earlier this week Colorado <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/governor/">Governor John Hickenlooper</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] three bills into law that seek to address gun violence. Last week the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] two gun control measures which would require background checks for private gun sales and improve security at schools. The Committee also approved a ban on assault weapons, but that bill will not be part of gun control legislation the entire Senate will take up next month and will instead be offered as an amendment. Earlier this month US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging passage of gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines and military style assault weapons. Also this month, the Maryland State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/senate-panel-approves-2-gun-control-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill making it more difficult to obtain a gun license.

The legislation, known as the personhood measure, <a href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/262197/group/homepage/">passed by a vote of 57-35</a> [AP report]. The North Dakota Senate approved the measure in February. To become law, the personhood measure needs to be approved by voters, and will likely appear on the November 2014 ballot. The personhood measure comes on the heels of two other North Dakota <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-lawmakers-approve-abortion-restrictions.php">bills restricting abortion</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0351-01000.pdf?20130316130925">One bill</a> [HB 1305, text, PDF] would ban non-emergency abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. The <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0304-02000.pdf?20130316130822">other bill</a> [HB 1456, text, PDF] would ban abortions sought because of genetic abnormalities.

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Earlier this month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Six days earlier Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Current bills include the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.00374:">Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act</a> [S 374 materials], which would require background checks for all private gun sales; the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.146:">School Safety Enhancements Act</a> [S 1460], which would renew a grant to help schools improve their security programs; and the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s54rs/pdf/BILLS-113s54rs.pdf">Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013</a> [S 54], which would make buying a weapon for someone who is barred from owning one a federal crime and would increase penalties for offenders. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] has approved all of these measures, but the full Senate and the House must vote on them before they can be signed into law.

<p>President Obama's plea for Congress to focus on gun control comes following the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December, which brought the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control debate</a> [JURIST archives] back to the forefront in the US.

Musharraf is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/12/us-pakistan-election-idUSBRE92B0PV20130312">expected to return</a> [Reuters report] to Pakistan on Sunday to be a candidate in upcoming parliamentary elections, ending a four-year self-imposed exile. A judge on Friday granted him <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-pakistan-leader-musharraf-granted-protective-bail-on-eve-of-return.php">protective bail</a> [JURIST report] so that he cannot be arrested within 10 days of his return on charges related to dismissal of judges and 14 days on charges related to two murders. HRW Pakistan Director Ali Dayan Hasan said:<blockquote>Musharraf should not be allowed to elude the serious legal proceedings against him on his return to Pakistan. Only by ensuring that Musharraf faces the well-documented outstanding charges against him can Pakistan put an end to the military's impunity for abuses.</blockquote>Hasan noted that dealing with the charges "will be a real test for Pakistan's judiciary" because many judges were personally affected by Musharraf's actions, but that it is "a test they must face and pass" to ensure that military leaders who abused their power are held accountable.

<p>Last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> [JURIST news archives] in 2007. Months earlier, a court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after Musharraf failed to respond to multiple subpoenas related to the assassination investigation. In 2011, Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf, but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve</a> [JURIST report] it on him because he was living in London at the time. That warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto on the day that she was assassinated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law was challenged by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on behalf of five fianc&#233;es whose marriage ceremonies at the Jefferson City Correctional Center were canceled last year because their incarcerated fiances were unable to sign a marriage license in the presence of the recorder of deeds. <a href="http://www.mow.uscourts.gov/judges/gaitan.html">Judge Fernando Gaitan, Jr.</a> [official profile], stated in his opinion that the law as applied to the plaintiffs in this case violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution because the plaintiffs "have a constitutional right to marry their incarcerated fianc&#233;s." The judge ruled that there was "no state interest sufficiently important" to uphold the law in light of its infringement upon the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Although the court did not strike down the law as applied to all individuals, it set new requirements for individuals who are incarcerated to obtain a marriage license, including a signed statement by the incarcerated individuals explaining that they are unable to appear in front of the recorder of deeds.

<p>The right to marry has been a controversial constitutional issue throughout the US in recent years, specifically in the context of <a href = "/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last week, the ACLU filed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/aclu-files-suit-seeking-new-mexico-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">lawsuit in New Mexico</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaration that it is unlawful for the state to deny same-sex couples the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. Earlier this month, President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archives] urged the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to strike down California's law banning same-sex marriage in the case <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket] which it will hear this week. Also last month, briefs were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/three-briefs-filed-with-supreme-court-in-case-challenging-doma.php">filed on both sides</a> [JURIST report] of a challenge to the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text], which the Supreme Court will also hear this week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dozens of activists were pardoned. While applauding the pardon, AI stated that individuals exercising their right to freedom of expression should not have been imprisoned in the first place, and that AI hoped this pardon would spur Omani authorities to eliminate restrictions that limit and criminalize freedom of expression. 

<p>Several activists and bloggers have recently been subjected to the restrictive freedom of expression laws in Oman. Last September, an Omani blogger was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/oman-blogger-imprisoned-fined-for-slander.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to one year of imprisonment by a Muscat court and fined 1,000 Omani Rials (USD $2,600).

The <a href="http://en.rsf.org/oman-prison-for-netizens-09-08-2012,43191.html">charges in those cases</a> [RSF report] ranged from illegal assembly and disturbing public order to defaming the sultan and of cyber-crime.

Afghanistan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile] sought to regain control of the detention center in efforts to <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130325/us-cedes-full-control-bagram-afghan-forces-1">reclaim sovereignty</a> [AFP report] over the country, as the US begins withdrawing troops from the region. The US was concerned that turning over the prison would put the secure detention of suspected Taliban and al Qaeda members at risk. The official handing over of control to Afghan authorities took place after an agreement was reached during a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119614">phone call</a> [press release] between US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=365">Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel</a> [official website] and Karzai on Saturday. US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan in an attempt to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.

<p>The rights of Afghan detainees at Bagram has been a controversial issue. Last November Karzai said that US forces were capturing and holding Afghans in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/afghanistan-president-claims-us-violating-detainee-pact.php">violation of a detainee transfer pact</a> [JURIST report] and that US forces should turn over that responsibility to Karzai's forces. Karzai's statement urged Afghan officials to make efforts towards toward obtaining entire responsibility for Bagram prison. Listed abuses included Afghan detainees held by US forces despite Afghan rulings to the contrary and the continued arrest of Afghans by US forces. JURIST Guest Columnist Ken Roach recently discussed the issue of prisoners <a href="/forum/2012/11/kent-roach-rahmatullah-detention.php">seeking substitute justice</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the courts of other democracies. In September the US <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-control-of-bagram-prison-and-a-third-of-prisoners-to-afghanistan.php/">handed over Bagram</a> [JURIST report] to Afghanistan but retained control over 600 prisoners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mtetwa was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on March 17 along with four officials from the party of <a href="http://www.zimbabweprimeminister.org/?option=com_content&view=article&id=43&Itemid=80">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [official website]. The officials are accused of illegally compiling information on high level corruption, while Mtetwa was accused of impeding police work by demanding to see a search warrant from police officers who were searching Tsvangirai's staff offices. High Court Judge Joseph Musakwa ruled that Mtetwa was following professional legal procedures when she demanded to see a search warrant. He also disputed the fact that Mtetwa obstructed justice. Mtetwa stated she believes her arrest was part of a ploy to intimidate human rights defenders prior to July elections. 

<p>Last week, Mtetwa was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-court-denies-bail-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] after prosecutors argued that she may be a flight risk because she is a citizen of Swaziland. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and other human rights organizations have said the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/zimbabwe-must-immediately-release-prominent-human-rights-lawyer-2013-03-20">arrest was unlawful</a> [AI press release]. Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. Last month three UN independent human rights experts urged the government of Zimbabwe to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">respect international human rights</a> [JURIST report] including privacy and freedom of association, in light of growing hostility toward civil society organizations. In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues." In January <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] said that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, had <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to ensure "credible, free and fair elections."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Banda allegedly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-25/zambia-ex-president-banda-arrested-on-abuse-of-power.html">channelled money from the sale of Nigerian crude oil</a> [Bloomberg report] into a private account instead of the nation's treasury. The Zambian Parliament officially charged Banda with abuse of authority, fraud and misappropriation of public funds on March 15. Prosecutors have asserted that the charges allow lawmakers to strip away Banda's immunity defense. According to media sources, authorities <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21925752">interrogated Banda</a> [BBC report] for nearly three hours upon his arrest, but the 76-year-old former-leader has now been released on USD $93,000 bail after producing two working sureties. Banda is due to appear in a Zambian magistrate court on Tuesday, where he is expected to deny all of the charges and seek reinstatement of immunity.

<p>Banda rose to power in 2008 after then-president Levy Mwanawasa died in office. He was later democratically elected. Banda faced legal trouble during his 2011 re-election bid when the opposing Patriotic Front <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/zambia-court-permits-president-to-run-for-re-election.php">alleged that Banda's father was born in Malawi</a> [JURIST report]. If proven, Banda would have been prohibited from running for office pursuant to the Zambian Constitution, which holds that a presidential candidate's parents must both be citizens of Zambia by birth. However, a Zambian court ruled Banda was free to run for re-election. Banda is not the only Zambian leader to face legal troubles. Former president and head of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy party, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1715419.stm">Frederick Chiluba</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/zambia-ex-president-acquitted-of.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in August 2009 of charges of stealing money from the country's treasury while in office from 1991-2001. In a separate case, Chiluba was ordered by a London court in July 2007 to <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-zambia-president-challenges-58m.php">pay $58 million in fines</a> [JURIST report] to Zambia to compensate for other funds stolen during Chiluba's decade in power. The suit was brought in Britain by Zambian officials because Chiluba and his associates held the assets in the UK and other European countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bahrain has faced international scrutiny regarding its treatment of political prisoners.

Last month the Bahrain Higher Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-court-acquits-2-policemen-in-protester-death.php">acquitted two police officers</a> [JURIST report] in the shooting death of a Shiite protester during the nation's pro-democracy protests in Manama that began in February 2011. The court concluded the two police officers fired shots at Fadhel Matruk but did not intend to kill him. They had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-police-officer-sentenced-to-7-years-for-killing-protester.php">sentenced to seven years</a>m[JURIST report] earlier for the same charges.

The <a href="http://www.cordkenya.org">Coalition for Reform and Democracy</a> (CORD) [party website] and two other groups reportedly petitioned the court for a recount of the election results, which declared that candidate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21544245">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenyatta">news archive</a>] surpassed CORD-backed candidate and Prime Minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile] by a vote of 50.07 to 43.3 percent. The high court consolidated the petitions and gave CORD the lead role in the challenge. According to reports, the petitioners hope that the recount will <a href="http://www.africareview.com/News/Kenya-court-orders-retallying-of-results/-/979180/1729966/-/c6nofaz/-/index.html">conclusively determine</a> [<em>Africa Review</em> Report] if the number of votes cast exceeds the number of registered voters. Vote recounting is to begin on Tuesday.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">challenge to the election results</a> [JURIST report] follows a decision by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) earlier this month calling the elections complex but credible and transparent. The IEBC has urged the candidates to accept the commission's official results. Also this month Odinga <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the decision to the high court. Odinga has accused electoral authorities of "electoral theft" and stated that he is appealing the results of the election to "ensure elections count." Police <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21812559">dispersed</a> [BBC report] a crowd of Odinga's supporters outside the Kenyan Supreme Court after they were told that they would not be allowed to congregate. Odinga called on his supporters not to resort to violence and stated that he would respect the decision of the Supreme Court, whatever the result.

According to AI's <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR47/001/2013/en/52dac84e-b937-4540-8907-14cb398202d2/afr470012013en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], Ingabire, president of the <a href="http://www.fdu-rwanda.org/en/">United Democratic Forces</a> (FDU-Inkingi) [party website], was treated unfairly during her original trial&#8212;her presumption of innocence was compromised by official statements made by Rwandan authorities, evidence proffered by the defense was challenged by the court while the plaintiff's evidence was left unquestioned, and the charges against her were based on vague, imprecise freedom of speech laws. AI also reported that the terrorism charge under which she was arrested was based on confessions made during the unlawful detention and torture of co-accused defendants Tharcisse Nditurende and Noel Habiyaremye. According to AI:<blockquote>Victoire Ingabire's first instance trial raised various fair trial concerns. The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court and it is essential that there is now strict compliance with international fair trial standards. ... The Rwandan authorities have a responsibility to ensure that Victoire Ingabire's appeal trial meets standards under Rwandan and international law.</blockquote>Ingabire's appeal was set to begin Monday.

<p>Ingabire's trial was the longest in Rwandan history. She was first <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010 for denying the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were killed. In October 2010 she was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-over-terror-allegations.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] under terrorism charges after evidence was discovered of her involvement with a Hutu militia group.

Ban appealed for calm and demanded the "swift restoration of constitutional order." The fighting began on Friday after a January peace agreement <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-centralafrica-rebels-idUSBRE92O0EW20130325">collapsed</a> [Reuters report]. Ban described the humanitarian situation as "dire" due to ongoing gun fire, looting and a lack of electricity and water. The UN estimates that there are 1.5 million people currently in the need of aid. In response to international criticism of the coup, the Seleka rebels pledged to create a power-sharing government, which they claim that Bozize had failed to do by not including Seleka fighters in the country's military. The <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website] also condemned the coup by the rebels and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-centralafrica-rebels-african-idUSBRE92O0DI20130325">suspended</a> [Reuters report] the CAR from the Union and imposed sanctions against the country.

<p>The CAR has been at the center of the child soldier controversy. In January <a href="http://www.unicef.org/index.php">UNICEF</a> [official website] said that it had received "credible reports" of both pro-government and rebel armed groups in the CAR <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">recruiting and including children</a> [JURIST report] in the country's conflict.

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-135.pdf">Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter</a> [transcript, PDF] the court is considering whether an arbitrator acts within his powers under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> [text] or exceeds those powers by determining that parties affirmatively agreed to authorize class arbitration based solely on their use of broad contractual language precluding litigation and requiring arbitration of any dispute arising under their contract. An attorney for <a href = "https://www.oxhp.com/">Oxford Health Plans LLC</a> [official website], who is trying to prevent a group of physicians from pursuing a class action suit against the company through arbitration, argued that, based on <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+Stolt-Nielsen+S.A.+v.+Animalfeeds+Int%27l+Corp.,&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=7084067900530012192&scilh=0">Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. Animalfeeds Int'l Corp.</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-class-arbitration.php">report</a>], its arbitration clause should stand: "There is no extrinsic evidence suggesting that the parties ever considered such a prospect, and there is no background principle of State law that favors it." Attorney for respondent, Dr. John Sutter, who is representing a class of physicians, argued that Oxford has no recourse if an arbitrator interprets their arbitration clause in such a manner. "Oxford cannot satisfy either of those standards here. Oxford does not dispute that the arbitrator interpreted the contract. Oxford's sole dispute here or challenge is that the&#8212;that the arbitrator interpreted the contract incorrectly. ...  They told the arbitrator at that time, look at the agreement, look at what transpired in 2002, back when this matter was in the superior court and make your decision. So the arbitrator applied the law that and applied the standard that he was told to apply. He didn't just disregard it. He didn't make a decision saying, I don't care what you are telling me to do."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-416.pdf">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v. Actavis</a> [transcript, PDF], formerly  <span class="casename">FTC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals</span>, on whether reverse-payment agreements&#8212;better known as "pay to delay" settlements, where patent holders pay competitors to delay them from entering the market&#8212;are <em>per se</em> lawful unless the underlying patent litigation was a sham or the patent was obtained by fraud or instead are presumptively anticompetitive and unlawful. The FTC argued that reverse-payment agreements are "paradigmatic antitrust trust violation[s]" because "they subvert the competitive process by giving generic manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual competition." Respondents, a group of pharmaceutical companies, argued that reverse-payment agreements are simply settlements. "You're not accepting infringement. What you're doing is recognizing there's a reasonable basis to assert the patent, a <em>bona fide</em> reasonable dispute, and the parties have the ability to settle the dispute. Just as if the party&#8212;if someone was entering into a license agreement with&#8212;with someone who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved it."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The many distinguished, hardworking and honorable judges in Pennsylvania deserve nothing less. An independent and impartial judiciary is a cornerstone of our system of justice, and public confidence in the judiciary is undermined when judges engage in criminal or other serious misconduct such as the crimes for which Justice Orie Melvin was charged and convicted.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.alleghenycourts.us/Home/Default.aspx">Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] is scheduled to sentence Melvin on May 7. The vacancy left by Melvin will <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/state/orie-melvin-resigns-governor-has-chance-to-appoint-new-justice-680887/">need to be filled</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] by an interim justice, nominated by Corbett with confirmation by two-thirds of the state senate. The interim justice's confirmation is typically conditioned on the caveat that he or she will not run in 2015 election to fill the vacancy.

<p>Judicial corruption is a threat worldwide. In January retired Michigan Supreme Court justice Diane Hathaway <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-michigan-supreme-court-justice-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.php">pleaded guilty to felony bank fraud</a> [JURIST report]. The charges arose from Hathaway deeding her home in Florida to a relative while negotiating a short sale on the home, resulting in a $600,000 debt they owed to their bank being erased. In October the UN called on nations around the world to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">combat judicial corruption</a> [JURIST report], stating that it is a human rights issue because it can deprive people of their due process rights. It also said keeping the judiciary free from corruption is critical to "strengthen judicial credibility and independence."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court will hear <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-682-BAMN-cert-petition.pdf">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-682.htm">docket</a>] on whether a state violates the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [text] by amending its constitution to prohibit race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public-university admissions decisions. The case concerns <a href = "/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">Proposal 2</a> [JURIST report], a 2006 Michigan state constitutional amendment that prohibits preferential treatment based on "race, gender, color, ethnicity or national origin" in public employment, public education and state contracting. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled the ban <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/sixth-circuit-strikes-down-michigan-affirmative-action-ban.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] late last year. Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself from hearing the case, as she did in the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=affirmative+action">affirmative action</a> [JURIST news archive] case currently before the court, <A href = "/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</a> [JURIST report], due to her involvement in briefing the issue as Solicitor General.

<p>The court also agreed to hear <A href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/562-cert-petition.pdf">United States v. Woods</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-562.htm">docket</a>] on whether <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6662">26 USC &#167; 6662</a> of the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26">Internal Revenue Code</a> [texts], which prescribes a penalty for an underpayment of federal income tax that is "attributable to" an overstatement of basis in property, applies to an underpayment resulting from a determination that a transaction lacks economic substance because the sole purpose of the transaction was to generate a tax loss by artificially inflating the taxpayer's basis in property. The court also directed the parties to brief on whether the district court had jurisdiction in this case under 26 USC &#167;6226 to consider the substantial valuation misstatement penalty. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rengan was charged with six counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy, and also faces separate <a href="http://www.sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] civil charges alleging a broader scheme following trades on stocks including <a href="http://www.polycom.com/">Polycom Inc</a> [corporate website] and Hilton Hotels. Rengan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-rajaratnam-insidertrading-idUSBRE92O0I320130325">entered his plea</a> [Reuters report] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], where his trial will begin on June 4.

<p>Raj Rajaratnam's case has been called the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history, and his sentence is the longest term ever imposed for insider trading. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-begins-11-year-sentence.php">11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] was significantly lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the 19 1/2-year minimum indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January 2011. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was sentenced to six months in prison in September 2011 and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and charged along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Djotodia, a leader of the <a href="http://worldwideconflicts.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/profile-seleka-coalition/">Seleka</a> [WorldWideConflicts profile] rebel alliance that seized the country's capital over the weekend and caused President <a href="http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-A-Ec/Bozize-Francois.html">Francois Bozize</a> [World Biography profile] to flee the country, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rebel-leader-dissolves-constitution-of-c-african-republic-radio/2013/03/26/f7065a36-9601-11e2-8764-d42c128a01ef_story.html">also declared</a> [AP report] the dissolution of the CAR parliament and government.

Seleka claims, however, that its actions are justified because the Bozize government first failed to uphold elements of the agreement, including a promise to remove South African troops from Bangui. Djotodia intends to serve out the rest of Bozize's term, which is set to end in 2016.

<p>Earlier this week UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels and advocated for the "swift restoration of constitutional order."

The CAR has also recently been criticized for its controversial use of child soldiers. In January <a href="http://www.unicef.org/index.php">UNICEF</a> [official website] said that it had received "credible reports" of both pro-government and rebel armed groups in the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">recruiting and including children</a> [JURIST report] in its conflict.

The joint endeavor is led by the <a href="http://gc4hr.org">Gulf Centre for Human Rights</a>, the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation of Human Rights</a>, the <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/">Arab Network for Human Rights Information</a> and the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> [advocacy websites]. Of the report's many criticisms, the coalition alleges a breach of the right to a fair trial as well as serious defects involving principles of equality and proper detention and procedure. The report accuses the judge of failing to look into <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21935780">credible allegations of torture</a> [BBC report] of the defendants and calls for an immediate investigation into the matter.

The group of defendants includes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/uae-trial-coup-plot">unnamed doctors, academics, lawyers and other professionals</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] arrested over the past year and accused of forming a secret network with ties to the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] and designs to raise money in a plotted coup against Emirati ruling families. UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. Since last year both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-calls-on-uae-to-investigate-claims-of-torture.php">investigate allegations of torture</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST reports] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The warrants were issued against activists opposing the Brotherhood and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] following violent clashes that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-activists-politicians-summoned-for-questioning-over-violence/2013/03/25/ef7ee392-9542-11e2-95ca-dd43e7ffee9c_story.html">occurred Friday</a> [AP report] outside the Brotherhood's headquarters, in which more than 200 individuals on both sides were injured. This recent incident was tied to an incident earlier this month in which Brotherhood members attacked a group of activists who were spray-painting anti-Brotherhood graffiti outside the group's headquarters. Rights activists have stated that the warrants could mark the beginning of an intimidation campaign against Morsi's opposition and alleged that the prosecutor has ignored violent acts carried out by Morsi's supporters. Morsi <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/24/morsi-warning-egypt-cairo-violence_n_2944366.html">warned his opposition</a> [AP report] in a speech Sunday that he would take measures to "protect this nation" if the violence did not cease. 

<p>Egypt has been plagued by protests and violence since the beginning of the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] two years ago. Earlier this month a Cairo court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentences-for-21-involved-in-fatal-soccer-riot.php">affirmed the death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of 21 individuals convicted of inciting a deadly riot after a soccer match in Port Said last February, which killed 74 people and injured more than a thousand. Dozens have died in street protests since the death sentences were originally handed down in late January, leading Morsi to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to quell the violent protests that subsequently erupted. In January, an Egyptian rights group reported that police abuse and torture <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">continue to be ongoing issues </a>[JURIST report] and police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. In December, Egypt's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">indefinitely halted operations</a> [JURIST report] amid pressure from protesters aiming to block judges from meeting to rule on the validity of the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perry</a> [transcript, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_audio_detail.aspx?argument=12-144">audio</a>], the first of two cases the court will hear this week on <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href = "/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">backgrounder</a>]. In Tuesday's argument, the court considered the validity of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. Same-sex marriage was briefly legal in California following a state Supreme Court decision and then overturned with a constitutional amendment created by Proposition 8. Early in the proceedings, the state of California declined to defend the law, and the backers of Proposition 8, <a href = "http://protectmarriage.com/">ProtectMarriage.com</a> [advocacy website], successfully intervened. The court heard arguments on whether Proposition 8 is constitutional under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> as well as whether the Proposition 8 supporters had standing to intervene under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders].

<p>The Proposition 8 supporters were asked to open their arguments with the standing issue. The supporters' attorney, Charles Cooper, argued that California's laws vested proposition backers and supporters with the right to defend the law. "I guess the point I want to make is that there is no question the State has standing, the State itself has standing to represent its own interests in the validity of its own enactments. And if the State's public officials decline to do that, it is within the State's authority surely, I would submit, to identify, if not all&#8212;any citizen or at least supporter of the measure, certainly those, that that very clear and identifiable group of citizens." He further argued that the proponents of the Proposition were not seeking recovery for their own injury but the injury to the State. The court then instructed him to proceed to the merits of the case, where he framed the issue as one that is part of an "ongoing democratic debate."<blockquote>But consider the California voter, in 2008, in the ballot booth, with the question before her whether or not this age-old bedrock social institution should be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that there's no way that she or anyone else could possibly know what the long-term implications of profound redefinition of a bedrock social institution would be. That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be irrational for that voter to say, I believe that this experiment, which is now only fairly four years old, even in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is conducting it, to say, I think it better for California to hit the pause button and await additional information from the jurisdictions where this experiment is still maturing.</blockquote>The Proposition 8 supporters also argued that this is not a gender classification issue, rather than a sexual orientation issue, and that sexual orientation is not a suspect or quasi-suspect class.</p>

<p>Theodore Olson represented the respondents, a pair of gay couples who were married in the interim before Proposition 8 was enacted. Also asked to approach the standing issue first, Olson suggested that the proponents do not have standing to defend the law and said an alternative would be the appointment of special counsel. Olson also argued that marriage is the right of an individual, nonspecific to the genders of the parties involved. "[T]his is a measure that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not society's right. It's an individual right that this Court again and again and again has said the right to get married, the right to have the relationship of marriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Justice Antonin Scalia asked Olson to explain when prohibiting same-sex marriage became unconstitutional. Olson and Chief Justice John Roberts also debated the meaning of the label "marriage," with Olson suggesting that, as a fundamental right, it is as important as labeling one who can vote in the US a citizen.</p>

<p>The Solicitor General, Donald Verrilli, also presented the views of the federal government. The government took no formal position on standing and did not brief the issue, but, when queried, Verrilli responded that "the better argument is that there is not Article III standing here." Verrilli then addressed the merits: "First, every warning flag that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case. And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of treating opticians less favorably than optometrists, when it really is the polar opposite of such a law. ... I do think the problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs out from under all of the justifications that Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8, and I understand Your Honor's point and the point that Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the actual substance of California law. And here, with respect to California law, gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the argument about the State's interests that Petitioners advance have to be tested against that reality, and they just don't measure up.

The requirement of photo ID for casting a ballot additionally calls for Arkansas to provide free photo IDs to voters without such items. Beebe rejected the bill <a href="http://media.arkansasonline.com/news/documents/2013/03/25/SB2Veto.pdf">citing unnecessary costs</a> [veto letter, PDF] faced by taxpayers, the extension of bureaucracy and potential disenfranchisement of voters:<blockquote>Senate Bill 2 is, then, an expensive solution in search of a problem. The Bureau of Legislative Research estimates that Senate Bill 2 will cost approximately $300,000 in tax dollars to implement; and that estimate does not take into account the ongoing costs that the taxpayers will continue to bear in future years. At a time when some argue for the reduction of unnecessary bureaucracy and for reduced government spending, I find it ironic to be presented with a bill that increases government bureaucracy and increases government expenditures, all to address a need that has not been demonstrated. I cannot approve such an unnecessary measure that would negatively impact one of our most precious rights as citizens.</blockquote>Beebe's veto can still be overridden by a majority vote in each chamber of the Republican-dominated state legislature. 

<p>If SB 2 is adopted, Arkansas will join nearly three dozen states with similar voter ID measures. Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/virginia-senate-approves-bills-limiting-acceptable-voter-id.php">Virginia Senate approved two bills</a> [JURIST report] restricting the acceptable forms of identification that voters can present at the polls. Also in February an agreement was reached <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-suspended-for-primary-election.php">allowing Pennsylvanians to vote</a> [JURIST report] in upcoming primary and special elections without submitting identification. Last December a three-judge panel in the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-gives-texas-permission-to-appeal-voter-id-law-ruling.php">granted permission to Texas officials</a> [JURIST report] to appeal a ruling that rejected a Texas law requiring voters to present photo identification to election officials before casting their ballots.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill would also create a state commission to manage medical marijuana programs at participating academic medical research centers. While the amount of distribution centers that would be created is uncertain, neither the University of Maryland Medical System nor Johns Hopkins University have not demonstrated an interest in being involved in this distribution system. Maryland <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website] previously opposed the bill but has recently reversed course and now supports the measure. The bill, which would not take effect until at least 2016, now moves to the Senate, which last week approved a bill to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-marylanders-caught-with-marijuana.php">decriminalize small amounts of the drug</a> [JURIST report]. The House has yet to act on that bill.

<p>If HB 1101 bill is approved, Maryland would join several states with laws that allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive], however, remains a hot-button issue in the US and abroad. Last month the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the private sale of <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge ruled that the state's <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] and <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives.

Members of the court cut him off and told him that he did not have to enter a plea at the hearing.

These new laws, respectively, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-lawmakers-approve-abortion-restrictions.php">ban abortion</a> [JURIST report] for the purpose of gender selection or genetic abnormalities, ban abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, and require that any physician performing an abortion have admitting and staff privileges at a nearby hospital. The ban on abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat effectively prohibits abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, and is in opposition to <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, which allows abortions until the fetus is viable, at 22 to 24 weeks. Dalrymple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/us/north-dakota-governor-signs-strict-abortion-limits.html?pagewanted=all">acknowledged</a> [NYT report] that the purpose of this specific law was to invite the Supreme Court to address the specific boundary created by <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, though he could not guarantee what the outcome of such a case would be. Pro-choice advocacy groups have responded promising challenges to this legislation, and North Dakota's only abortion clinic has <a href="http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com">stated</a> [official website] that it is open, accepting appointments, and performing legal abortions. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/north-dakota-governor-signs-the-nation%E2%80%99s-most-extreme-attack-on-women%E2%80%99s-constitutional-ri">condemned the new legislation</a> [press release] and promised to file a challenge to the ban on abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat. The North Dakota legislature will be considering further legislation aimed at abortion in the upcoming weeks, including a law which would define life as starting at conception. The laws signed today <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/26/north-dakota-abortion-ban_n_2956552.html">will take effect on August 1</a> [Huffington Post Report] unless there is further intervention.  

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Earlier this month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

To be eligible to receive a driver's license, the applicant must provide proof of having filed Maryland state income tax returns for the previous two years, or being a dependent on such tax returns. These licenses will not be sufficient for situations requiring a federally acceptable identification. Legislators indicated that the bill has a very practical purpose for <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-03-25/news/bs-md-immigrant-licenses-20130325_1_illegal-immigrants-tanya-broder-sanctuary-state">increasing safety</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report], to ensure that all Maryland drivers have passed a driver test and carry motor vehicle insurance. The <a href="http://www.aclu-md.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland</a> (ACLU-MD) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu-md.org/press_room/120">praised the legislation</a> [press release] saying, "more drivers on our roads will be trained, tested, and insured, improving highway safety for everyone. Voting in favor of this bill is the responsible and humane choice and will benefit all of Maryland's residents." The Maryland House is expected to begin hearings on the legislation later this week.

<p>The policy of issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants has varied between states. In January Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/illinois-governor-signs-bill-allowing-illegal-immigrant-drivers-licenses.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that permits undocumented immigrants to obtain temporary driver's licenses if they can provide proof of one-year state residence and an unexpired passport from their country of citizenship. In contrast Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/arizona-governor-issues-executive-order-denying-benefits-to-undocumented-immigrants.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] in August that instructs state agencies not to provide driver's licenses and other public benefits to undocumented immigrants who have gained the right to work under the new federal program known as <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">Deferred Action</a> [DHS memorandum; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">report</a>].

Jardines</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that an alert from a narcotics detection dog on the front porch of suspect's house constitutes a search within the meaning of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html#amdt4_hd4">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The ruling upheld the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2011/sc08-2101.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that evidence gathered pursuant to search warrant obtained based on the positive alert from a narcotics detection dog which was brought to the suspect's front porch must be suppressed because the dog's presence constituted a search. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia noted that the case was straightforward:<blockquote>The officers were gathering information in an area belonging to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house&#8212;in the curtilage of the house, which we have held enjoys protection as part of the home itself. And they gathered that information by physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.</blockquote>Scalia also noted that while visitors knocking on the front door were typically permitted by residents, the presence of "that same visitor exploring the front path with a metal detector, or marching his bloodhound into the garden before saying hello and asking permission, would inspire most of us to&#8212;well, call the police." Writing in dissent, Justice Samuel Alito would have permitted the police activity, noting that it occurred completely within the path to the front door of the residence. The decision was split 5-4, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joining in the majority. Alito was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer in dissent.

<p>This case follows closely behind <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=149748">Florida v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-upholds-drug-sniffing-dog-search.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an alert from a well-trained narcotics detection dog certified to detect illegal contraband is sufficient to establish probable cause for the search of a vehicle, reversing the Florida Supreme Court.

Our spring fund drive ends on March 31 - that's only four and half days away! Our goal for this drive is $15,000 but we're only 17% of the way there. We can hit 25% of our goal if we raise another $1,200 or 50% if we raise $4,800. These are both ambitious goals for the next calendar week, but I know that our audience believes in our mission enough to help us reach our goal.

<p>As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>. You can also support JURIST on an on-going basis with <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php?mode=recurring">regular monthly contributions</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

The governor signed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+SB1256">two bills</a> [SB 1256, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+HB1337">HB 1337</a>] which established the new ID standards for elections. SB 1256 requires that voters present a photo ID that lists their address, such as a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/voter-id-bill-heads-to-mcdonnell/2013/02/15/de58ba54-779a-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">driver's license, passport or workplace photo ID</a> [WP report]. HB 1337 removes utility bills and paychecks from the list of acceptable forms of voter ID. The <a href="http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/">Virginia Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/virginia-senate-approves-bills-limiting-acceptable-voter-id.php">approved these bills</a> [JURIST report] last month. The new ID standards will become effective in July provided no judicial injunctions arise from the legislation.

<p><a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#voterid">Voter ID laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become increasingly controversial and commonplace throughout the US. Last week the Arkansas senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-senate-approves-voter-id-bill.php">approved</a> its own voter ID bill, which was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-governor-vetoes-voter-id-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST reports] by the governor. Last month lawyers for Pennsylvania and the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] reached an accord <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-suspended-for-primary-election.php">extending the temporary enjoinment</a> [JURIST report] of the Pennsylvania voter ID laws, and allowing state residents to vote in upcoming primary and special elections without submitting ID. There are now more than <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">30 US States</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 17 states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. The issue remains legally controversial, especially in <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-supreme-court-expedites-challenge-to-state-voter-id-law.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/wisconsin-ag-to-ask-state-supreme-court-to-reinstate-voter-id-law.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-supreme-court-allows-voter-id-question-on-november-ballot.php">Minnesota</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Qatada is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-govt-loses-court-challenge-to-deport-radical-muslim-preacher-abu-qatada/2013/03/27/73e6c648-96d5-11e2-a976-7eb906f9ed9b_story.html">wanted in Jordan</a> [AP report] on <em>in absentia</em> convictions of organizing and encouraging bomb attacks in 1999 and 2000. Qatada has successfully fought deportation in British and European courts, but the British government has indicated it will continue despite the dismissal from the Court of Appeal. The UK stated it would work in collaboration with Jordan to try to ensure that evidence obtained by torture not be used. Qatada was first detained under British anti-terrorism laws in 2002.

<p>Palestinian-Jordanian Qatada has fought terrorism charges and extradition in court for more than a decade. In December 2012, UK authorities challenged a UK immigration decision that effectively blocked Jordanian extradition requests for Qatada.  The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/special-immigration-appeals-commission">UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> (SIAC) [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada that May. In early February he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uk-court-sets-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] but was arrested again in April to begin deportation proceedings. Qatada was granted political asylum by the UK in 1994. He was arrested in 2001 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 and later that year went into hiding to avoid being arrested and detained under the then-proposed Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He was arrested again in 2002 and held until March 2005. In February 2009 the ECHR ordered the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">pay 2,500 in damages</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada after determining that his imprisonment violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Despite his previous grant of asylum and fears of torture and persecution, UK Law Lords in February 2009 ruled that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be returned</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan to face terrorism charges. The February decision overruled an April 2008 Court of Appeal decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking his deportation</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi had removed Mahmoud from office following the acquittal of some who had been charged with murdering protesters against the rule of then-president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hosni+mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive] during the uprising which brought Morsi to power. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21953418">decision</a> [BBC report] was based on a constitutional clause which established that the prosecutor-general post comes with a four-year term and is not subject to presidential dismissal. The decision of the court annuls current Prosecutor General Talaat Abdallah's appointment to the post. The court's ruling is not final, as it can be overturned by the Court of Cassation which is Egypt's highest appeals court.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by protests, power struggles and violence since the beginning of the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] two years ago. On Monday, Abdallah <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/top-egypt-prosecutor-issues-arrest-warrants-for-5-activists.php">issued arrest warrants on Monday against five activists for their alleged involvement in recent clashes between protesters and the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website]. Earlier this month a Cairo court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-confirms-death-sentences-for-21-involved-in-fatal-soccer-riot.php">affirmed the death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of 21 individuals convicted of inciting a deadly riot after a soccer match in Port Said last February, which killed 74 people and injured more than a thousand. Dozens have died in street protests since the death sentences were originally handed down in late January, leading Morsi to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declare a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to quell the violent protests that subsequently erupted. In January, an Egyptian rights group reported that police abuse and torture <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">continue to be ongoing issues </a>[JURIST report] and police conduct has not improved since the abuses faced under the old regime. In December, Egypt's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">indefinitely halted operations</a> [JURIST report] amid pressure from protesters aiming to block judges from meeting to rule on the validity of the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Bakiyev regime was ousted in 2010, and the interim government has brought charges against the family including the former president and his sons Maxim and Zhanysh. Kurmanbek and Zanysh Bakiyev are believed to be in Belarus.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtcontemplation.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard oral arguments Wednesday in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-307_jnt1.pdf">United States v. Windsor</a> [transcript, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_audio_detail.aspx?argument=12-307">audio</a>], the second of two cases the court heard this week on <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href = "/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">backgrounder</a>]. In Wednesday's argument, the court considered the validity of Section 3 of the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law that recognizes only opposite-sex marriages for federal benefits purposes, despite state law on the issue. The case concerns <A href = "http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-thea-edie-doma">Edith Windsor</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a widow who had a legal same-sex marriage under Canadian and New York law but was denied spousal deduction for Federal estate taxes when her wife died. Prior to her challenge, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">announced</a> that it would no longer defend DOMA in courts, and in response, the US House of Representatives <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">formed</a> [JURIST reports] the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) to defend the law.  

<p>Paul Clement, the attorney for BLAG, began his arguments on the merits of the case by suggesting the federal government can and should be afforded the same flexibility in defining marriage as the individual states: "the basic principles of federalism suggest that as long as the Federal government defines those terms solely for purposes of Federal law, that the Federal government has the choice to adopt a constitutionally permissible definition or to borrow the terms of the statute." Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor questioned him on the many things DOMA restricts for couples that are lawfully married in their home states, as well as whether the federal government respects other forms of marriage, such as common law, when some states do not. Clement insisted that DOMA is expressing a right of definition by the federal government:<blockquote>[I]t really matters that all DOMA does is take this term where it appears in Federal law and define it for purposes of Federal law. It would obviously be a radically different case if Congress had, in 1996, decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in that way.</blockquote>Justice Anthony Kennedy brought up that there are approximately 1,100 federal laws that affect marriages and the federal government seeks only to define this aspect. Clement responded that when states began experimenting with same-sex marriage laws, the federal government decided that since those 1,100 laws were passed with the traditional definition in mind, the federal government should uphold that definition through DOMA. He also suggested there was an equity consideration involved, because DOMA treats committed same-sex couples the same regardless of where they live, while Sotomayor pointed out that it treats married couples differently. Despite Clement's arguments, Ginsburg referred to the reach of DOMA as "pervasive": "They're not a question of additional benefits. I mean, they touch every aspect of life. ... You're saying, no, State said two kinds of marriage; the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage."</p>

<p>Solicitor General Donald Verrilli then argued in support of the respondent, Windsor, suggesting that DOMA creates an <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> violation, but does not violate principles of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/federalism">Federalism</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders]. Verrilli also rejected Clement's argument that DOMA is solely about uniformity:<blockquote>Now, this statute is not called the Federal Uniform Marriage Benefits Act; it's called the Defense of Marriage Act. And the reason for that is because the statute is not directed at uniformity in the administration of Federal benefits. ... So the issue of uniformity just doesn't get you there, because there is no uniformity advantage to Section 3 of DOMA as opposed to the traditional rule. ... And the fundamental reality of it is, and I think the House report makes this glaringly clear, is that DOMA was not enacted for any purpose of uniformity, administration, caution, pausing, any of that. It was enacted to exclude same-sex married, lawfully married couples from Federal benefit regimes based on a conclusion that was driven by moral disapproval.</blockquote>Verrilli also argued that when the aforementioned 1,100 laws on marriage were enacted, they were not with the "traditional" definition of marriage in mind, but to apply to whatever state definition of marriage, even if it varied on age, consanguinity, or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>Attorney Roberta Kaplan then argued directly for Windsor. Kaplan did not indicate whether the law automatically violated principles of Federalism, but pointed to its peculiarity as a federal law: "Federal litigation for hundreds of years with respect to the residency of where people live or don't live, or whether they are divorced or not divorced throughout the Federal system. And the Federal government has always handled that and has never before&#8212;and we believe this is why it's unconstitutional&#8212;separated out a class of married gay couples solely because they were gay." Kaplan also suggested that, in 1996, the law was passed due to the majority of Congress not understanding that there were no fundamental differences between straight and gay couples. Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice John Roberts questioned Kaplan on whether LGB citizens are a politically vulnerable minority, to which she responded that only LGB citizens, as a distinct group, have had their rights put up for referendum. She also argued that acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality comes less from "political power" and more from societal understanding of sexual orientation.</p>

<p>All of the attorneys except Kaplan were also asked to brief the court on <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] standing issues involved in the case, at the beginning of arguments. Vicki Jackson, a court-appointed <em>amicus curiae</em> first briefed the issue, arguing against standing because "Petitioner, the United States, does not ask this Court to redress the injuries it asserts. [BLAG], which does seek redress in the form of reversal, asserts no judicially cognizable injury. While it is natural to want to reach the merits of such a significant issue, as in Raines v. Byrd, this natural urge must be put aside because, however important the constitutional question, Article III prevents its decision here and requires this court to await another case, another day, to decide the question." Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan offered the Federal government's position that although the SG and the president have declined to enforce or defend the law, the government still had a judgment against it and thus an injury, which permitted the appeals that laid to the Supreme Court. He also presented the position that the government is aggrieved an injury totally because the law is unconstitutional and they are forced to deal with whether or not to enforce an unconstitutional law. Srinivasan then argued that BLAG could only have statutory standing as a party, akin to an <em>amicus</em> party, as they have not been granted intervenor status. Clement suggested that <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Chadha&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=2221871582286121199&scilh=0">INS v. Chadha</a> [opinion] empowered the House of Representatives to defend an act of Congress.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the group, <a href="http://atheistsofflorida.org/">Atheists of Florida, Inc.</a> (AOF) [advocacy website], argued that opening the meetings of the <a href="http://www.lakelandgov.net/CityGovernment.aspx">Lakeland City Commission</a> (LCC) [official website] with a sectarian prayer violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] and Article I of the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=constitution&submenu=3">Florida Constitution</a> [text], Judge Arthur Lawrence Alarcon affirmed, on similar and alternative grounds, an earlier ruling by the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Florida</a> [official website] that <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/florida/flmdce/8:2010cv01538/247109/54">granted summary judgement</a> [order] for LCC. First, the court held that AOF failed to show that the March 2010 Florida resolution adopting the practice resulted in advancing Christianity over all other religions simply because the persons selected to open meetings included sectarian references in their prayers. Second, the court held that it lacked proper jurisdiction to hear the case because AOF's challenge to LCC's pre-resolution speaker selection as unconstitutional was a moot issue. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the district court was likewise without jurisdiction to hear AOF's claim, and therefore remanded the mootness issue back to the lower court. 

<p>Public prayer has generated a substantial amount of controversy over the last several years. In January 2012 the US <a href="www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-county-board-meeting-prayers.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a similar case concerning whether a county board of commissioners in North Carolina violated the Establishment Clause by opening their public meetings with prayers. In August 2011 JURIST contributor John Whitehead <a href="/hotline/2011/08/john-whitehead-legislative-prayer.php">noted</a> [JURIST comment] that the decision by the <a href="www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] contradicted precedent establishing that public officials beginning meetings with a prayer is constitutionally permissible. In April of that year, the <a href="www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-national-day-of-prayer.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> (NDP) [official website]. The Seventh Circuit's decision overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-rules-national-day-of.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] that the NDP was an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontapplesamsung.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] on Tuesday requested that the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] grant a <a href="/paperchase/Apple_Inc_v_Samsung_Electroni_.pdf">new trial on damages</a> [text, PDF] in its ongoing patent infringement dispute against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung Electronics</a> [corporate website]. Judge Lucy Koh earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-reduces-damages-award-that-samsung-must-pay-apple.php">reduced the jury's damages award</a> [JURIST report] by $450 million because she found that the jury calculated damages for 14 certain infringing Samsung products based on improper legal grounds. The jury had originally awarded Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion</a> [JURIST report] in damages against Samsung. Koh had encouraged the two parties to appeal her ruling to the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website]. Samsung in response filed a motion requesting final judgement on the 14 products for which the court upheld the jury's award and a stay on the trial on damages for the other 14 products on which the court had invalidated the jury award. Apple argued that Samsung's request would lead to an ineffectual outcome:<blockquote>[Samsung's proposal] would cause unnecessary delay and judicial inefficiencies, and would not advance the Court's goal of obtaining Federal Circuit guidance on the March 1 Order's grant of a new trial or the damages issues it identifies. To the contrary, Samsung's proposal is likely to lead to a remand without a substantive decision from the Federal Circuit. For these reasons, Samsung's motion should be denied, and the Court should schedule a new trial on the remaining damages issues, after which final judgment may be entered as to all claims in the case.</blockquote>Apple argued that Samsung's proposal would not avoid the need for a new trial on damages for the 14 products that Samsung requested be stayed and then there would be a possible appeal on damages and infringement issues with respect to the new trial. Apple argued that this scheme would not actually improve judicial efficiency. In a separate motion, Apple requested that the court consider reinstating the jury's <a href="/paperchase/Apple_Inc_v_Samsung_Electroni_%20%281%29.pdf">$85.3 million judgement</a> [text, PDF] for Samsung's Galaxy S II AT&#38;T and Infuse 4G products if the court allows Samsung to proceed with an appeal prior to the new trial.

<p>The fight over the new damages trial is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. In December Judge Koh <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-overseeing-apple-samsung-lawsuits-requests-temporary-ceasefire.php">requested a temporary "ceasefire"</a> [JURIST report] in litigation while she determined whether or not to reduce the damages that Samsung owed to Apple.

Former interior minister, <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/zupljanin_stanisicm/4">Mico Stanisic, and Stojan Zupljanin</a> [ICTY materials], his subordinate, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icty-begins-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">faced charges</a> [JURIST report] of persecution, extermination, murder, deportation, and torture of Muslims and ethnic Croats, as part of a plan to establish "a Serb state, as ethnically 'pure' as possible." They were each found guilty on counts of persecution, murder and torture, while Zuplijanin was additionally convicted of extermination. 

<p>Wednesday's conviction is one of many decisions that have been made regarding the events of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnia+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive], which left approximately 100,000 people dead and about 2.2 million homeless. Since its establishment in 1993, the ICTY has indicted more than 161 people for violations of humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001. A prosecution motion to have the cases of Stanisic and Zupljanin joined was granted in September 2008, and both men pleaded not guilty in November. Zupljanin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/serbia-police-arrest-bosnia-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> in June 2008 by Serbian authorities and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">transferred</a> [JURIST reports] to the ICTY for trial. Stanisic surrendered to the ICTY in March 2005. Stanisic was originally indicted by the ICTY in 2005, and Zupljanin was indicted in 1999.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW noted that the threat of beatings and rape from internal security forces was significant and called for the practices to end. According to HRW, "Instead of finding a safe haven from fighting and famine, many displaced Somalis who came to Mogadishu have found hostility and abuse." The group went on to say, "Rape and sexual abuse of displaced women and girls, including by government soldiers and militia members, has been an enormous problem in the unprotected environment of the camps." HRW advanced several recommendations to curtail the practices and improve conditions, including: strengthening law enforcement and improve accountability; "facilitat[ing] unhindered access by humanitarian agencies to civilians at risk;" and engaging with the UN to expand human rights compliance.

<p>Human rights violations of abuse and rape have been a continued concern in Somalia. Earlier this month, a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government. That ruling followed the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">recommendation</a> [JURIST report] of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] to reopen the case. In February, Somalia's new prime minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid, said that the Somali authorities would become more involved in <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-pm-promises-to-increase-protection-to-rape-victims-journalists.php">protecting rape victims</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/bahrain-activists-get-10-years-for-protests">sentences</a> [AP report] arise from attacks by the activists on police officers during recent protests.

This sentence comes in the middle of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bahrain-rights-activists-on-hunger-strike.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] commenced on March 17 by daughter and father, Zainab al-Khawaja and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who have been detained in Bahrain.

Behrend</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that judges can reach the merits of an underlying claim in determining whether to certify a class under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23(b)</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In doing so, the court reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/102865p.pdf">refused</a> [opinion, PDF] to decide the plaintiffs' class status based on the underlying merits. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, relied heavily on <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">Wal-Mart v. Dukes</a> [JURIST report] which outlines the court's stance on the standard of certification of a class in a class action lawsuit. Scalia wrote that:<blockquote>it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question, and that certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied. Such an analysis will frequently entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim. That is so because the class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action. [internal citations and quotations omitted for clarity]</blockquote>Scalia went on to hold, "By refusing to entertain arguments against respondents' damages model that bore on the propriety of class certification, simply because those arguments would also be pertinent to the merits determination, the Court of Appeals ran afoul of our precedents requiring precisely that inquiry."

<p>The 5-4 ruling fell along traditional ideological lines with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito joining Scalia in the majority. Justices Burth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer jointly authored a dissent which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The dissent found the writ of <em>certiorari</em> was improvidently granted in this case, further noting that the parties did not effective brief the question posed by the court. The dissent went on to say, "the decision should not be read to require, as a prerequisite to certification, that damages attributable to a classwide injury be measurable 'on a class-wide basis.'"</p>]]></content:encoded>

'investigative or law enforcement officer' means any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law." The court held that this includes correctional officers, and they do not have to be in the process of of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest to be liable for an intentional tort. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court:<blockquote>The FTCA's only reference to "searches," "seiz[ures of] evidence," and "arrests" is found in the statutory definition of "investigative or law enforcement officer." By its terms, this provision focuses on the status of persons whose conduct may be actionable, not the types of activities that may give rise to a tort claim against the United States. The <em>proviso</em> thus distinguishes between the acts for which immunity is waived (e.g., assault and battery), and the class of persons whose acts may give rise to an actionable FTCA claim. The plain text confirms that Congress intended immunity determinations to depend on a federal officer's legal authority, not on a particular exercise of that authority. Consequently, there is no basis for concluding that a law enforcement officer's intentional tort must occur in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest in order to subject the United States to liability.</blockquote>The court settled a circuit split on the issue and <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17694705513272467395&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">reversed</a> [opinion] a grant of summary judgment by the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

<p>Kim Millbrook is an inmate at the US Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and alleged that several male correctional officers sexually assaulted him. His suit will now be able to proceed on its merits. His attorney <A href = "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/03/27/175494286/high-court-rules-u-s-government-can-be-sued-over-actions-of-prison-guards">praised the decision</a> [NPR report] and suggested the reality that FTCA could provide damage awards for Federal prisoners will decreases instances of prisoner abuse.

The lawsuit alleges that JPM engaged in risky business practices in investing in Lehman Brothers in a way that violated securities loan agreement between the parties. The pension plan entered into the securities agreement in 2005 and argue the agreement was violated because JPM did not invest conservatively. Forrest found that the pension plan raised "sufficient allegations to support a claim for breaches of both the duty of care and the duty of loyalty." Because of this, Forrest ruled that the case must forward after it had been delayed at the pleading stage for three years. A conference is scheduled for April 10 to move forward with discovery.

<p>JPMorgan has faced numerous lawsuits regarding its business practices. In January it was revealed that several US regulators were planning on <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-regulators-expected-to-issue-cease-and-desist-order-to-jpmorgan.php">issuing a cease-and-desist</a> [JURIST report] order to JPM. Earlier in January the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Credit Union Administration</a> (NCUA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-credit-union-regulator-sues-jpmorgan-over-faulty-mortgage-securities.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against JPM for the sale of $2.2 billion of faulty residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to credit unions. In December the NCUA brought a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/credit-union-agency-files-larges-suit-to-date-against-wall-street-firms.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPM. In July JPM agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/jpmorgan-agrees-to-100-million-settlement-in-credit-card-case.php">$100 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June the firm was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-for-jpmorgan-settlement.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The most <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/27/russia-raids-human-rights-crackdown">recent seizure</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] came two days after the government <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/europe/russian-authorities-raid-amnesty-international-office.html?_r=0">raided</a> [NYT report] the local office of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. The raids are based on the NGO 'foreign agents' law that was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] last year. The law labels all NGOs that accept international funding as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the <a href="http://government.ru/eng/power/99/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website]. They are also obligated to file quarterly reports with Justice officials. In case of failure, fines of over USD $15,000 are imposed. Russia's enforcement of the law has been heavily criticized by the international community as undermining freedom of speech and civil society within the country. The US has expressed its concern over the systematic unannounced inspections of NGOs. Germany and France have summoned Russian diplomats in their country for an explanation. Russia stated they are ensuring NGOs are complying with the law. It was reported that the government already has conducted unannounced searches on more than 80 organizations across the country.

<p>The legislation became effective in November after it was approved by the Russian <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/">Federal Council</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">report</a>], the upper house of parliament, and by the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-passes-bill-restricting-ngos-and-re-criminalizing-libel.php">report</a>]. Since then, activists have vowed to challenge it. They <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-activists-to-appeal-ngo-law-to-europe-rights-court.ph">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] claiming that the law contains errors and thus, must be amended. The word "foreign agent" in Russia is nearly synonymous with the word "spy" and many observers believe the law is intended to discredit the works of NGOs. In August, Executive Director of Greenpeace International Kumi Naidoo called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/putin-urged-not-to-implement-ngo-foreign-agents-law.php">refrain from implementing</a> [JURIST report] the new law. Three UN experts urged Russia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-experts-urge-russia-parliament-to-reject-internet-regulation-bill.php">reject the bill</a> [JURIST report] prior to its passage. </p>]]></content:encoded>

On March 14, Malawian national Adami Wilson was executed by firing squad after being convicted on drug smuggling charges. According to the UN, an execution for less serious crimes, including drug charges, is arbitrary and unlawful. Heyns stated:<blockquote>Such a practice is unacceptable. Under international law, the death penalty is regarded as an extreme form of punishment which, if it is used at all, should only be imposed for the most serious crimes, that is, those involving intentional killing, and only after a fair trial.</blockquote>Currently, more than half of the prisoners sentenced to death in Indonesia have been convicted on drug charges. The execution of Adami Wilson was the country's first use of the death penalty since the 2008 execution of three men convicted for their involvement in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bali+bombing">nightclub bombing</a> [JURIST news archive] that killed 202 people. The Indonesian Attorney General has announced plans to execute 20 inmates later in 2013.

In a 5-2 <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/12936/index.do">decision</a> [judgment], the court found that text messages are private communications and cannot be intercepted by police without special wiretap authorization under <a href="http://yourlaws.ca/criminal-code-canada/part-vi-invasion-privacyl">Part VI</a> [text] of the Criminal Code. Under the <a href="http://yourlaws.ca/criminal-code-canada/48701-information-general-warrant">general warrant provision</a> [text], a judge may only issue a warrant to a police officer if no other provision would provide for a warrant. The case centered on <a href="http://telus.com">TELUS Communications Company</a> [official website], which has an unusual routine of briefly storing electronic copies of text messages sent or received by its subscribers on its database. The court reasoned that if TELUS did not maintain a computer database, police would be required to obtain an authorization under Part VI to obtain prospective text messages:<blockquote>This creates a manifest unfairness to individuals who are unlikely to realize that their choice of telecommunications service provider can dramatically affect their privacy.The technical differences inherent in Telus' transmission of text messages should not deprive Telus subscribers of the protection of the Code that every other Canadian is entitled to.</blockquote>The court's decision applies to all text messages, including stored messages and prospective messages. 

<p>Rapid changes in technology have left legal questions about the extent of digital privacy protection. In December the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that data stored on personal cell phones is <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-data-stored-on-cell-phones-not-protected.php">not protected</a> by the Stored Communications Act (SCA) [text]. The US Senate Judiciary Committee in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/Senate-committee-approves-bill-requiring-warrant-to-search-emails.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent police from searching e-mails and other electronic content without a warrant. In August, a member of the the German Pirate Party filed an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-party-appeals-law-banning-anonymous-phone-purchases.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] a German law that requires pre-paid cell phone purchasers to provide valid identification with each purchase.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although we've only got 3 and half days left, we're still well short of our goal. So, if you can afford <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">as little as $10</a> to support JURIST's mission to document law and empower people, we would greatly appreciate it.

<p>But, hey, we know how it is. JURIST is <a href="http://jurist.org/staff/">powered by more than 60 law students</a>, which is to say that we're familiar with tight bank accounts and we appreciate that not all of our readers may be able to support us financially. That doesn't mean we don't value your support, and it doesn't mean that we don't want to hear from you!</p>

<p>I'd like to invite everyone to share your JURIST experiences by sending an email to <a href="mailto:testimonials@jurist.org">testimonials@jurist.org</a>. Our current and former staff members have <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/testimonial/">shared</a> the benefits they've reaped from working with JURIST, the motivations that lead them to JURIST in the first place, and how they think JURIST benefits the world at large. </p>

<p>Now it's your turn! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:testimonials@jurist.org">testimonials@jurist.org</a> and tell us what you get from reading JURIST, what makes JURIST unique, and why you think we should keep doing what we do. Be sure to include your name and your location. If you've got no objections, we'll share your thoughts with your fellow JURIST fans!</p>

<p>When we say that we value your support, we don't only mean that we value your financial contributions. JURIST exists to provide our readers with objective legal news and informed, civil, expert commentary. Without our readers, it's a moot point. As such, we value your attention, your time, your intellectual curiosity, and your willingness to forego sensationalism in favor of reasoned discourse.</p>

<p>Let us know what you value about JURIST!</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group of medics were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/03/2013328105647947157.html">originally charged</a> [Al Jazeera report] with taking part in unauthorized demonstrations after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21966509">treating protesters</a> [BBC report] who were injured by police and have alleged that they were tortured and coerced into making confessions following their arrest. At least 28 other medics were also charged and sentenced to prison terms for similar conduct, but most of the sentences were overturned. Charges remain for two of those arrested as they failed to appear in court to challenge their convictions. 

<p>In October of last year, the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] issued to nine medics for allegedly participating in the March of 2011 anti-government protests. Twenty medics, including 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics, were originally jailed and sentenced in September 2011 for providing treatment to injured protesters after the Salmaniya Medical Complex was stormed by security forces in March. Though originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, a Bahrain court in June 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bahrain-court-r.php">overturned or reduced the sentences</a> [JURIST report] for most of the medical professionals.

The lese majeste law found in Article 112 of <a href="http://www.thailandlawonline.com/laws-in-thailand/thailand-criminal-law-text-translation">Thailand's Penal Code</a> [text] allows for anyone who "defames, insults or threatens" a member of the royal family to be sentenced to a prison term of three to 15 years. Hongkangwan was arrested on March 10, 2011, at an anti-government demonstration held in Bangkok where he was selling video CDs that were deemed defamatory to Thailand's royal family. He was released nine days later on bail. The videos were a potion of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/">Foreign Correspondent</a> [media website] 2010 series containing private footage of Thai Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Hongkangwan was also <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/thailand-sentences-man-3-years-royal-insult-0">convicted</a> [AP report] of violating copyright law and was fined $66,666 baht (USD $2,271). 

<p>Thailand's <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/thailand-court-upholds-royal-insult-law.php">lese majeste</a> [JURIST report] law has generated controversy. Magazine editor and political activist Somyot Pruksakasemusk was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/thailand-monarch-pardons-us-citizen-on-defamation-charge.php"> sentenced </a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in January under the lese majeste law for negatively mentioning the monarchy in two articles he published. Following Pruksakasemusk's conviction the <a href="http://www.alrc.net">Asian Legal Resource Centre</a> (ALRC) [official website] submitted a <a href="http://www.humanrights.asia/news/alrc-news/human-rights-council/hrc22/ALRC-CWS-22-02-2013/?searchterm=lese%20majeste">statement</a> [text] to the UN Human Rights Council. "The logic underlying the use of article 112 frequently cited by the Court is the uniqueness of Thailand as a nation with the king as the head of state. This decision speaks manifestly to an imbalance in the law of Thailand as written and currently enforced between protecting the sovereign and protecting the human rights of the people residing in the country." The ALRC urged the Human Rights Council to release Pruksakasemsuk and other individuals convicted under Article 112. In July Thai-born US citizen Joe Gordon was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/thailand-monarch-pardons-us-citizen-on-defamation-charge.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from a Thai prison and pardoned by the Thai monarch for defaming the Thai royal family. UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Frank La Rue <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-condemns-thailand-royal-insult-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the law, stating, "[t]he threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The motion was filed only a day before a fact-finding visit to the US detention center in Cuba by the <a href="www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website], and the lawyers contend that such treatment is being used to undermine an <a href="http://rt.com/news/guantanamo-bay-hunger-strike-399/">ongoing hunger strike</a> [RT timeline] by Musa'ab Omar al-Madhwani and 30 additional inmates. In support of their argument that al-Madhwani's issue is a matter of life and death, his lawyers also attached to the motion an affidavit from psychiatrist and retired general <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/about/experts/stephen-xenakis.html">Stephen Xenakis</a> [PHR backgrounder], who opined that the hunger protest and lack of adequate drinking water increases the prisoners' chance of incurring "gastrointestinal infections and a quick demise." Although the US <a href="www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has not yet filed a response to the motion, a spokesperson for the prison is <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57576720/guantanamo-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-guards-denying-us-bottled-water/">reported to have said</a> [AP report] that all prisoners are provided with bottled water and that the tap water is safe to drink. White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/Josh%20Earnest">Josh Earnest</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/27/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-josh-earnest-03272013">told reporters</a> [press briefing transcript] that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] and his administration are "closely monitoring the hunger strikes at Guantanamo Bay."

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] and defense lawyers for terrorism detainees held at Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Rear Admiral <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=577">John Smith Jr.</a> [official profile] describing harsh conditions faced by the detainees and indicated that the detainees have begun to protest the conditions via hunger strike. The lawyers learned of these practices and protests after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">permitted to visit</a> [JURIST report] the detention center in February, though Guantanamo has long been the subject of various controversies during the <a href="/currentawareness/terrorism.php">Global War on Terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. <a href="www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] contends that the 32-year-old al-Madhwani has been <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,AMNESTY,,USA,509787bb2,0.html">held without cause at Guantanamo Bay</a> [AI report] for more than a decade, where he was sent shortly following his arrest by Pakistani security forces on September 11, 2002. In May 2011, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] affirmed a lower court's decision confirming that al-Madhwani was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-denies-habeas-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">lawfully detained</a> [JURIST report] for being part of al Qaeda. In December 2009, the district court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-judge-denies-yemeni-guantanamo.php">denied al-Madwani's <em>habeas corpus</em> petition</a>, ruling that the government may continue to detain him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW alleged that Deputy Minister Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan, known as Colonel Karuna, is a former leader of the the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which is accused of war crimes committed during a 26-year civil war. Ultimately, Karuna and his unit changed sides, joining forces with the Sri Lankan government. In March, Karuna called for an investigation of war crimes by the LTTE. Asia Director at the Human Rights Watch released a statement, saying, "Karuna's call for war crimes investigations should not allow him to airbrush out his own role in atrocities. His LTTE forces were implicated in some of Sri Lanka's most horrific abuses, so the government's long-stalled war crimes investigations might as well begin with him." HRW has urged the government not to overlook Karuna's conduct while he was a member of the LTTE.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009. Last week the UN Human Rights Council passed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-body-adopts-resolution-on-sri-lanka.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. In February Sri Lankan authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">accused of using rape</a> [JURIST report], as a method of interrogating members or supporters of the LTTE. Earlier that same month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized</a> Sri Lanka for failing to investigate war crimes, and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-pushes-un-for-independent-investigation-of-sri-lanka-rights-abuses.php">pushed</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent investigation of rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/pm-defends-quitting-un-desert-convention-says-it-s-too-bureaucratic-1.1215058">claimed</a> [CTV report] the move was necessary as the convention was "too bureaucratic" and that only one fifth of the CAN $350,000 contributed to the convention actually was used for programming. Canada becomes the only UN member state that is not a member of the <a href="http://www.unccd.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">UN Convention to Combat Desertification</a> (UNCCD) [official website]. The move to drop out of the UNCCD had actually occurred last week without any public acknowledgement until Wednesday. The UNCCD has been in effect since 1996 and is working to "forge a global partnership to reverse and prevent desertification/land degradation and to mitigate the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability."

<p>The decision to drop out of the UNCCD has cast additional attention on Canada's environmental record. In 2011 Canada was the first nation to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/canada-withdraws-from-kyoto-protocol-on-climate-change.php">withdraw</a> [JURST report] from the <a href="http://unfccc.int/essential_background/kyoto_protocol/items/1678.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/kyoto.php">news archive</a>] on climate change. The decision to drop out of Kyoto was five years after they were subject to a series of <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/canada-facing-environmentalist-lawsuit.php">lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for their failure to comply with the standards imposed by Kyoto.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The voucher program allows low- and middle-income families to apply public funds towards the cost of attending private schools. Opponents of the voucher program claim that money is diverted from public schools, but the court was not swayed by these arguments:<blockquote>First, the voucher program expenditures do not directly benefit religious schools but rather directly benefit lower-income families with school-children by providing an opportunity for such children to attend non-public schools if desired. Second, the prohibition against government expenditures to benefit religious or theological institutions does not apply to institutions and programs providing primary and secondary education.</blockquote>The court did not address the public policy merits of the program. While 9,000 students enrolled in the program this school year, the voucher program is available to children statewide, and a cap has yet to be placed on its potential size. 

<p>Indiana's voucher program is the largest of several states that engage in similar programs, but some state programs have been struck down by courts. In 2008 an Arizona appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/arizona-appeals-court-strikes-down.php">struck down the school voucher program</a> [JURIST report]. In 2006 the Florida Supreme court also <a href=" /paperchase/2006/01/florida-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down the state's voucher program</a> [JURIST report]. In 2002 the US Supreme Court <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/536/639/case.html">upheld a similar voucher program</a> [opinion] in Ohio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Liu Xia, the wife of Liu Xiaobo and sister of Liu Hui, was under house arrest in December but secretly enabled news reporters and family friends to sneak past security guards who were watching her house. Liu Xiaobo is currently <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for "inciting subversion of state power" and dissidence.

International organizations have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-call-for-china-to-release-nobel-winner-liu.php">rallying for Liu's release</a> since he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a> [JURIST reports] in November 2010.

The documents said that the Chinese government responded by saying the conviction was in accordance with Chinese criminal codes and consistent with the rule of law. In December 2010 Liu was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-awarded-nobel-peace-prize-in-absentia.php">awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize in absentia</a> [JURIST report] at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway.

Vlahovic was acquitted on six counts that the court did not find were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Vlahovic's lawyer intended to appeal to the court's decision.

<p>In January, the same court sentenced a former Bosnian Serb police officer to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ex-police-officer-sentenced-to-20-years-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">20 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the 1995 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/85087/section/1">Srebrenica massacre</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">archive</a>].

The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2008-title42/pdf/USCODE-2008-title42-chap85.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [text, PDF] forbids the construction of new sources of air pollution without a permit, but excepts sources already in operation unless the EPA deems a prospective overhaul as a "major modification" resulting in a "significant emissions increase." Permits require companies to use the "best available control technology" to mitigate emissions. In 2010, the EPA sued utility company <a href="https://www2.dteenergy.com/wps/portal/Home/!ut/p/b1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOLNDAPdjd0CTAzcPTxcDDxDTAPdDPwDDdzNjYEKIoEKDHAARwNC-sP1o8BK8Jjg55Gfm6pfkBthoOuoqAgAqO6Yfw!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">DTE Energy</a> [corporate website] for overhauling its Monroe Unit 2 coal-fired power plant without installing permit-required pollution controls. DTE argued that the permit was not required because its overhaul did not result in a "significant emissions increase." A judge for the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] ruled in favor of DTE in 2011, holding that any EPA determination as to "major modifications" must occur only "if and when post-construction monitoring shows a need to do so." The Sixth Circuit overruled the decision Thursday as an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/court-says-epa-can-try-to-block-power-plant-construction-in-some-cases-to-prevent-pollution/2013/03/28/c93555b8-9808-11e2-b5b4-b63027b499de_story.html">unwarranted limitation</a> [WP report] on the EPA's power to challenge suspected violations of emissions requirements before project completion can provide either supportive or contradictory evidence.

<p>The EPA is often involved in litigation concerning air pollution and CAA compliance. In August the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-epa-in-cross-state-pollution-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the EPA overstepped its authority under the CAA by issuing a regulation limiting power plants' emissions that cross state lines. Also in August the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-epa-in-texas-air-permit-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the EPA exceeded its legal authority under the CAA by disapproving a Texas plan to issue permits under the Act. In June 2011 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-states-global-warming-suit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the EPA and the CAA displace claims made under the federal common law of nuisance regarding whether electric utilities contributed to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22global+warming%22">global warming</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January 2011, the state of Texas failed for the third time in two months in its attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/court-denies-texas-request-for-stay-of-new-epa-rules.php">block EPA regulations</a> [JURIST report] governing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied the state's request to block an EPA program allocating greenhouse gas emission permits under the CAA.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The modifications impose tougher penalties and heighten identification requirements. First, the bill requires all public employers, their contractors and subcontractors to verify the work eligibility and "lawful presence" of all new employees though the online federal work authorization program called E-Verify. In addition, under Section 3 public employers must provide an annual report to exhibit compliance with the bill. Local government entities that do not comply with the immigration sanctuary policies "shall be subject to the withholding of state funding or state administered federal funding," with the exception of funds listed under another code. Further, foreign passports alone are not considered a secure and verifiable identification document and cannot be used to obtain public benefits. SB 160 prevents undocumented immigrants from securing an adult education, driver's license, grants, public housing, retirement and other listed federal, state and local benefits. However, the bill does not penalize those who knowingly act in violation of the identification requirement by supplying basic human necessities to undocumented immigrants. The House and Senate approved the bill Thursday by a 113-54 and 43-9 vote, respectively. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on undocumented immigration. Recently Georgia Representative Barry Flemming, R-Harlem, introduced <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/20132014/135611.pdf">House Bill 667</a> [text, PDF], which would ban undocumented immigrants from possessing, shipping or transporting firearms. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] permanently <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime. In December the same judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">lifted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">government inaction</a> [OHCHR press release] has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country. In the past six months, 26 people have been killed and thousands newly displaced as a result of the escalating religious conflicts. In <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.58.Add.1_AV.pdf">response</a> [text, PDF] to the report, the Myanmar government stated allegations of human rights violations against civilians of ethnic minorities are unfounded. However, Quintana urges:<blockquote>The Government must take immediate action to stop the violence from spreading to other parts of the country and undermining the reform process. This includes stemming campaigns of discrimination and hate speech which are fuelling racist and, in particular, anti-Muslim feeling in the country. And it involves holding to account those responsible for acts of violence and destruction against religious and ethnic minorities. ... Tackling discrimination is fundamental to establishing the rule of law, and impunity for acts of violence and discrimination must no longer be tolerated. The military and police must now be held to account for human rights violations committed against ethnic and religious minorities.</blockquote>He also emphasized that civil society and political parties play a strong role in confronting prejudice and discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities.

<p>Myanmar's human rights record has been of noticeable concern recently. Earlier this month, Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-expert-urges-myanmar-to-address-remaining-issues.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the country of the possibility that the current reformation process may be endangered by leaving areas of importance untouched, especially related to the states of Rakhine and Kachin. He made similar calls last month when he commended the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-calls-on-myanmar-to-address-ongoing-human-rights-issues.php">lack of reform</a> [JURIST report] that has been achieved in Myanmar and urged authorities and citizens to address issues of truth, justice and accountability through the creation of a truth commission to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and prevent future human rights violations. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end to the sectarian violence in Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, calling on the government to do more to end the violence and protect the rights of the Rohingya, whose civil rights were effectively taken away with their citizenship in 1982. In August <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] reported that Myanmar's army is <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier in August HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group found that Brazil regularly detains individuals for minor criminal offenses, and some detainees have to wait months to see a lawyer. The rights group noted that this practice violates Article 9 of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], which requires governments to seek alternatives to detention for minor offenses and to avoid detaining the accused pending a trial. Other concerns raised by the group included discriminatory detentions faced by indigenous people and drug addicts, as well as a lack of judicial review over cases resulting in the detention of minors. 

<p>Brazil has been working to fight corruption since the 2005 "Mensalao" scandal [Veja backgrounder, in Portuguese]. In November the Supreme Court of Brazil sentenced a former aide to ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to over <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/brazil-high-court-sentences-ex-presidential-aid-for-corruption.php">10 years of imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the vote-buying scheme. Jose Dirceu, Lula's former chief of staff, was convicted of using public funds to pay coalition parties for political support. The trials of those accused of participating in "Mensalao" were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/world/americas/brazilian-corruption-case-raises-hopes-for-judicial-system.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">hailed as a potential turning point</a> [NYT report] for Brazil in the its fight against corruption. However, observers warned that with Brazil hosting the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2012/10/17/top-brazil-judge-says-war-on-corruption-progressing/">risk for corruption remains high</a> [WSJ report]. In August 2011 Brazilian Judge Patricia Acioli, known for taking a hard-line against corrupt officials and militia death squads, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-judge-who-jailed-corrupt-officials-killed.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] outside of her home by two masked men on motorbikes. Acioli was <a href="http://oglobo.globo.com/rio/morte-de-juiza-em-niteroi-acontece-oito-anos-apos-execucao-de-magistrados-que-tambem-combatiam-crime-organizado-2869725">one of three judges executed</a> [O Globo report, in Portuguese] in Brazil in the past eight years for their investigations into organized crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A court in Czechoslovakia sentenced Csatary to death <em>in absentia</em> in 1948, but the country subsequently abolished the death penalty before dividing into Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Csatary was arrested in July 2012 after the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-allegedly-in-hungary.php">submitted new evidence</a> [JURIST report] to the Budapest prosecutor's office detailing the war crimes allegedly committed by Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary, a former senior Hungarian police officer in the Slovakian city of Kosice. Slovakian authorities announced later that month that they <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/slovakia-to-seek-extradition-of-accused-nazi-from-hungary.php">intended to seek the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of the Hungarian man to try him on charges of abusing and helping deport thousands of Jews during the Holocaust.

<p>Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hungary-charges-suspected-ex-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged Csatary</a> [JURIST report] in July 2012 with the "unlawful torture of human beings," a war crime that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Csatary was at the top of the SWC's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7958595.stm">list of most wanted Nazi war criminals</a> [BBC backgrounder], and the SWC had already called on the Hungarian government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/hungary-urged-to-prosecute-alleged-nazi-war-criminal.php">prosecute the Nazi war criminal</a> [JURIST report] when the center issued its annual report in April. Nazi prosecution continues regardless of the ages of the criminals. In January the Ingolstadt Prosecutor's Office <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/german-prosecutors-ex-nazi-criminal-should-serve-life-sentence.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to jail Klaas Faber, a Dutch native who fled to Germany after being convicted in the Netherlands in 1947 of Nazi war crimes. Germany <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened investigations</a> into former Nazi death camp guards in October, which stemmed from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction of John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST reports], a former guard at a camp in Poland who was deported to Germany to stand trial for his alleged Nazi crimes. Last September alleged Nazi Sandor Kepiro <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/accused-hungary-nazi-dies-while-awaiting-appeal.php">died while he awaited an appeal</a> [JURIST report] on his acquittal on war crimes charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At issue in the case was a 2008 state tax law known as the <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/assets/attachments/3711.pdf">Internet Tax</a> [text, PDF], which places a sales tax on out-of-state online businesses that generate at least $10,000 in annual sales to New Yorkers from in-state websites. The plaintiffs in the case, <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://overstock.com">Overstock.com</a> [corporate websites], argued that the Internet Tax violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Commerce Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, writing for a majority of the court, rejected Amazon and Overstock's argument, declaring that the Internet tax is valid because it meets the US Supreme Court's requirement that a sufficient nexus exist between the sellers and the state imposing the tax:<blockquote>Through this statute, the Legislature has attached significance to the physical presence of a resident website owner. The decision to do so recognizes that, even in the Internet world, many websites are geared toward predominantly local audiences. Viewed in this manner the statute plainly satisfies the substantial nexus requirement.</blockquote>One judge dissented, saying that the connection between the sellers and New York was too remote to meet the substantial nexus test.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=commerce+clause">Commerce Clause</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a subject of heated legal controversy recently, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">high-profile ruling</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">report</a>] on the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [JURIST backgrounder] last June. In July JURIST guest columnist Robin West <a href="/forum/2012/07/robin-west-aca-roberts.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Chief Justice Roberts's conviction that the individual mandate is not authorized by the Commerce Clause is evidence of a new, anti-collectivist conception of individual rights that is growing in popularity. In September 2011 JURIST guest contributor Steven Schwinn <a href="/forum/2011/09/steven-schwinn-eleventh-circuit-federalism.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] erred when it <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down part of the PPACA</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Frank La Rue</a> expressed concern over attacks against journalists and other media workers, while the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/FreedomReligionIndex.aspx">Heiner Bielefeldt</a> [official profiles] expressed particular alarm at the destruction of Hindu temples and homes, which has left many families homeless. The violence has largely occurred in the context of the trials and verdicts of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page]. The ICTB was established as a domestic court to try and punish persons accused of committing atrocities such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity during Bangladesh's 1971 independence war. Violent clashes between security forces and various  factions of civilians have resulted in at least 88 deaths and led to the injury of hundreds.

<p>Last month the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">Bangladesh parliament</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-parliament-approves-amendments-to-war-crimes-law.php">report</a>] and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-cabinet-approves-changes-to-war-crime-laws.php">Bangladesh Cabinet</a> [JURIST report] approved amendments to the country's war crimes laws to allow prosecutors to appeal sentences given to defendants convicted of war crimes. These amendments were a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">response to protests</a> [JURIST report] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, another JI leader, was given a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War (BLW). The protesters believed a life sentence was too lenient and that Mollah, who was convicted of charges including murder, rape and torture, should have been given the death penalty. The law passed by parliament will be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladeshs-parliament-amends-war-crimes-law-18523564">effective retroactively</a> [AP report] to July 2009, allowing prosecutors to appeal Mollah's sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At issue were two provisions in the law: one that allows police to arrest non-citizens without a warrant and one that prohibits the use of consular IDs as forms of identification. Judge Sarah Evans Barker ruled that these provisions violate the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am4.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution because they allow police to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/29/us-usa-immigration-indiana-idUSBRE92S0FY20130329">arrest people for matters that are not crimes</a> [Reuters report]. The <a href="http://www.aclu-in.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/us-district-court-strikes-down-indianas-immigration-law">praised the ruling</a> [press release] as an affirmation of individual rights and a check on states' power to regulate immigration. Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/">Attorney General Greg Zoeller</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.in.gov/activecalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=92703&information_id=177900&type=&syndicate=syndicate">declared</a> [press release] the state will not appeal the ruling.

<p>In June 2011 Barker <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the same two provisions of SEA 590. <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on undocumented immigration. Earlier this week Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/georgia-lawmakers-expand-immigration-law.php">expanded its immigration law</a> [JURIST report] to implement stricter security and immigration compliance than the original 2011 version. Earlier in March the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/ninth-circuit-blocks-day-laborer-provision-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">blocked enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of an Arizona immigration law that prohibits motorists from stopping traffic to pick up workers. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-declines-to-extend-2010-immigration-ruling-retroactively.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that its 2010 ruling that immigration attorneys are required to inform their clients about some of the deportation consequences of guilty pleas under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentvi">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] of the Constitution does not apply retroactively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former DOJ intern Sean Gerlich alleges that he was denied a position in the department's <a href="http://www.justice.gov/careers/legal/entry.html">Honors Program</a> [DOJ materials] in 2006 because of his earlier work with a human rights group and a democratic campaign. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] denied Gerlich's motion for class certification and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7542833858537769198&q=Sean+Gerlich+v.+DOJ&hl=en&as_sdt=2,36">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] some of his claims, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8179706869820732968&q=Sean+Gerlich+v.+DOJ&hl=en&as_sdt=2,36">granting summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the DOJ on the remaining claims. The appeals court held that summary judgment was inappropriately granted on Gerlich's <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm">Privacy Act</a> [text] claims, stating:<blockquote>In light of the destruction of appellants' records ... a permissive spoliation inference was warranted because the senior Department officials had a duty to preserve the annotated applications and internet printouts given that Department investigation and future litigation were reasonably foreseeable. On remand, the district court shall construe the evidence in light of this negative spoliation inference, which would permit a reasonable trier of fact to find that two of the appellants were harmed by creation and use of the destroyed records.</blockquote>Although the lawsuit has been revived, the court <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2013/03/29/appeals-court-revives-lawsuit-against-justice-dept">declined to reverse</a> [AP report] the district court's refusal to make the case a class action on behalf of all applicants who might have been denied interviews because of liberal political affiliations.

<p>The Bush administration's DOJ faced severe criticism for its hiring and firing processes. Gerlich's suit stemmed from a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/s0806/final.pdf">2008 report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-favored-politically-conservative.php">report</a>] released by the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> [official website] which found that the DOJ had improperly granted preferential treatment to conservative candidates in assessing job and summer internship applications under 2002 and 2006 screening programs. The report found that political officials played a significant role in the department's hiring processes, supporting accusations that the Bush administration has politicized the supposedly nonpartisan department. Former attorney general Alberto Gonzales <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/gonzales-resigns-as-us-attorney-general.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 amid related allegations concerning the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+attorney+firing">alleged firing of US Attorneys for political reasons</a> [JURIST news archive]. Gonzales' successor, <a href="http://www.debevoise.com/attorneys/detail.aspx?id=9cbb337b-188c-4113-8397-510b95f750ad&type=showfullbio">Michael Mukasey</a> [professional profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/mukasey-names-prosecutor-to-investigate.php">appointed a special prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008 to determine whether criminal charges were warranted in connection with the firings. The move was recommended in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by investigators at the DOJ. The report was one of several internal assessments of the role politics played in DOJ hiring and firing practices. In July 2008, the Inspector General and Professional Responsibility offices concluded that DOJ officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-report-says-officials-employed.php">made illegal hiring decisions</a> [JURIST report] based on applicants' political and ideological beliefs. In November 2009, the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/house-committee-documents-show-rove.php">released testimony and e-mails</a> [JURIST report] purporting to show that Bush administration political adviser <a href="http://www.rove.com/">Karl Rove</a> [personal website] was involved in the firings. Citing executive privilege, Rove refused to testify in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/rove-fails-to-appear-at-senate.php">July 2008</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

First, the top of the page was taken over by a big banner screaming about our <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">Spring 2013 Fundraising Drive</a> .Second, your objective legal news coverage has been occasionally interrupted by entreaties from yours truly <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">asking for your financial support</a>, which has fairly nothing to do with the news. I assure you that we haven't undertaken these changes lightly. 

<p>Our goal in splashing our drive across the top of every page and in me writing to you in the first person is to call attention to one simple fact: <strong>we need the financial support of our readers to keep going</strong>. JURIST has made remarkable strides over its 17 year history, and will doubtless make many more in the future with your help. </p>

<p>So, if you've already shown us some love by <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">making a donation</a>, know that we all appreciate it, and you can stop reading. If you haven't had a chance to <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">make a donation</a> to support our Spring Fundraising Drive, please consider doing so now. You only have a few more hours to <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">make a donation</a> to JURIST before the drive is done.</p>

<p>If all of our readers kicked in $10, we could probably buy an airport or something. Appreciating that we probably don't need an airport, I would nonetheless ask you to consider whether JURIST is worth $10, $25 or more to you, and if so, to <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">make a donation</a> proving it. Rest assured, if you missed the Spring 2013 Fundraising Drive, your <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">financial support is always welcome</a>. </p>

<p>Also, take comfort in the fact that you won't be forced to look at that banner for much longer.</p>

<p>T-minus 28 hours as I write this. <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">Get those donations in</a>!<br />

Pursuant to the court's decision, Kenyatta will be sworn in next month.

<p>Kenyatta is currently facing <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] charges of crimes against humanity for violence following the 2007 election. Earlier this month Kenyatta's lawyer asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him for lack of evidence, but the prosecution refused. Kenyatta's request was based on the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1568411.pdf">withdrawal</a> [decision, PDF] of charges against co-defendant Francis Muthaura for lack of evidence. Kenyatta's lawyers claimed the evidence against Muthaura and Kenyatta was the same, but the prosecution disagreed. Kenyatta's trial was previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php#">postponed</a> [JURIST report], and it will begin on July 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>
